If my young reader have already visited Fairy dell  Hall and passed a few merry hours with Know a bit the learned fay it is quite a natural  thing that an introduction to Fairy Frisket  should follow I need explain to no one where these  fairies have come from whether they lurk in flower  or book or only in some quiet little nook in the brain  of A L 0 E My reader will scarcely expect in his  walks to see either Knowabit or Frisket spring from  under a fern leaf or sit rocking on a hawthorn spray  but he may and very probably will meet some other of  the curious creatures described in my little book It  is as well to mention that my own knowledge of the  manners and customs of the insects both winged and  wingless herein described has been chiefly drawn from  Knights Library of Entertaining Knowledge and  Woods delightful Homes without Hands  As for the two human specimens in the story the  selfish and the unselfish the boy who cared for his own  pleasure only the other who eared for the comfort of  others they may be found in thousands of homes in our  land they especially the first are common enough  in Britain however rare fairies may be If some  spoilt little master have received this small volume  amongst other Christmas or New Year presents I hope  that he may have patience to read it to the end and  before he closes the book consider whether he would  wish to pass all his days on a nettleleaf of selfishness  or whether he would not rather by his deeds his  words and his example show that he has undergone  a nobler change than that which transforms the creeping  caterpillar into a creature of light and beauty  A L O E  I  THE FAIRYS VISIT  9  XI  PAIBY CONVBRSK  17  UI  INTO THE WOODS  80  IV  THE ANTHILL  38  V  AMAZONS  49  VI  THE fairys 0PER  68

fairys MISTAKE  188  FAIRY FRISKET  CHAPTER I  THE fairys visit  ARAH careless Sarah theres not a doubt of the  fact you quite forgot to shut the window of  Squire Philimores study last evening and to  close the shutters and put up the bar and  anybody that might take a fancy to get into  the house could do so with ease The squire is fast  asleep in his big bed dreaming of hounds and hunting  and Master Philibert fast asleep in his little bed and  all the servants in their different rooms and so sound  is their slumber that they would not awake if any one  were to rattle a drum in the study  But that which comes in through the open window  into the study causes no noise at least none that the  sharpest ear would hear First there comes the soft  nightbreeze stealing very gently so gently that it  does not make even the papers on the table rustle and  scarcely swells the curtain at all Then there comes the  beautiful moonlight laying along the floor what looks  like a strip of silver carpet with the shadow of the  latticed windowbars forming the pattern upon it And  there is something besides this something softer than  the breeze and fairer even than the moonlight A  pretty little fairy is perched on the windowsill looking  into the room She is scarcely more than five inches in  height so small that she might lie at full length in a  ladys silken slipper and find it a comfortable sofa and  a girl might wear as a ring the slender gold belt which  girdles the waist of the fairy A wreath of tiniest  heatherbells encircles her hair if that can be called  hair which is so fine that it hangs over the fairys  shoulders like a golden mist which the puff of a childs  breath could set floating upon the air The little ladys  dress is formed of petals of the blushrose fashioned by  fairy fingers with a light robe of gossamer over it such  as lies on the grass on summer mornings all fringed  with diamond dewdrops A violet would be large  enough to cover the print of the fairys footstep if that  tiny white foot ever left which it does not the lightest  trace behind The wings that spread at the fairys back  are such as the dragonfly wears they are transparent  as glass and as they quiver in the silvery rays appear  to be tinted with every hue in the rainbow The light  which comes streaming in behind the fairy throws no  shadow of her figure upon the sill she seems herself as  light as the moonbeams The wand in her tiny hand  golden at one end green at the other is not much thicker  than a horsehair and the bag which hangs from the  fairys girdle looks exactly like one of the violetvelvet  petals of a heart sease sprinkled over with golddust  In short Fairy Frisket as she stands in the moonshine  peering curiously into the halfdark study is as lovely an  object to look on as any mortal could wish to behold  This must be the place that I heard of but oh  what a den for a fairy to hide in cried Frisket in a  voice high and shrill as the chirp of a cricket but sweet  as the nightbirds song Knowabit Knowabit  show a bit show a bit After four hundred years spent  apart let brother and sister meet once again 1  And at the silvery call up sprang from a large red  edged volume which lay on the ledge of a bookcase a  tiny form being that of a bearded fairy dressed in cap  and gown as a student and with a minute pair of gold  spectacles resting upon his small nose Some of my  readers may already have been introduced to the learned  fay Knowabit and have heard of his doings at Fairy  dell Hall where he had lived amongst books and papers  ever since the invention of printing  No sooner did Knowabit catch sight of Frisket than  with an exclamation of pleasure he made a bound like  a cricket towards her while she flew like a butterfly  towards him and the brother and sister embraced in  the air as fondly as brother and sister should do whirling  round and round in their joy at meeting as two feathers  might whirl round in a gale Then they alighted on  the squires silver inkstand which stood in the middle  of his table and gazed upon one another to see if ages  had wrought any change upon either  Four or five hundred years is of course no great  length of time to a fairy and yet it was clear from  Friskets face that she did see a change in her brother  and a change that did not please her at all With  manner rather too brusque for a lady to say nothing of  a fairy Frisket suddenly cried Whats this darted  at Knowabit s spectacles and pulled them ofi from his  nose She then held them between her finger and  thumb and looked at them as you dear reader might  look at a slug if found in your teacup  Whats this repeated Frisket and what can  possibly be its use   These are my spectacles sister and I use them to  read books with replied Knowabit with dignity as  he pointed towards the wellfilled shelves of the squires  library   Books repeated Frisket scornfully Rusty  fusty musty dusty Better far that you should throw  away these spectacles as you call them and that odd  dress with which I suppose you are mimicking man  Why I do believe that youve crushed down your wings  under that black gown When was black ever worn  before by a fairy   I confess replied Knowabit mildly that I have  adopted some of the ways of mankind I suppose from  living hundreds of years under a roof I have had so little  use for my wings that I have not spread them since the  death of Queen Bess and scarcely remember that I  possess them I can bound very well from place to  place without them   Ay in a tootyi exclaimed Frisket with scorn   You choose spectacles instead of free wings books  instead of leaves and mosses and ferns and flowers  You like to hear the mouse squeaking behind the old  wainscot instead of the lark singing in the air   You would rather have me sing said Knowabit  breaking out into song   Where the bee sucks there lurk I  In a cowslips bell I lie  There I couch when owls do cry  On a bats back do I fly  After sunset merrily  Merrily merrily shall I live now  Under the blossom that hangs on the bough   Yes said Frisket more quietly that is a true  fairy song   Yet it was written by a man observed Knowarbit   Ay look as much surprised as you please but it was  certainly written by old Will Shakespeare whose bust  you see there at the top of the bookcase   How could a man a son of earth a beefeating crea  ture know anything about fairies cried Frisket   And what does a fairy a child of air a dewsipping  creature know about men asked Knowabit smiling   Has my fair sister ever so much as heard the voice of  one of the race   I know enough of them to dislike them cried  Frisket and I dont care to know anything more   Sister sister is not that prejudice Is not that  judging without knowledge Suppose that instead of  quivering your wings so scornfully and looking as if  you thought the squires mahogany table scarcely fit to  set your little foot upon you were to give back to me  my glasses and we two were to take our seats on this  silver inkstand and talk over the matter quietly to  gether Would not that be better than disputing on  the first night of our meeting Perhaps you may find  that the human race with all its faults is not to be  despised even by a fairy  Frisket could not help looking up to her brother I  do not mean because he was much taller than herself  by at least the breadth of a mans thumb but because  he had a calmer judgment a more thoughtful mind  Knowabit had learned a good deal from his favourite  books and had perhaps made as good use of his spectacles  as Frisket had of her wings The ladyfairy closed those  glassy wings which folded neatly behind her back  restored the tiny spectacles to their owner and sat down  as her brother had proposed upon the silver top of one  of Squire Philiraores inkbottles while Knowabit rested  on the other the box to hold stamps being between  them The two fairies looked like ornamental figmes of  Wisdom and Mirth adorning the inkstand but Wisdom  was smiling and Mirth had somethiig of thought on her  bright little face The squires comfortable study seemed  like a prison to Fairy Frisket and it is scarcely to be  wondered at that she felt the top of the inkbottle a far  less agreeable seat than a clump of green moss or a  downlined nest or the petals of a fragrant mossrose  CHAPTER 11  FAIRY CONVERSE  fRISKET And now tell me Brother Fay what  you can find in men or their works so charm  ing as to make you desert the green woods  What joy can there be in this dull den with  its dusty piles of books to compare with that  of tripping it over the grass rocking in the breeze on a  trembling aspen or watching the bees plundering the  flowers of golden pollen the spider spinning her silver  thread or the butterfly basking her wings in the sun  shine  Knowahit I might say that I learn much from  these books of the wonders of Nature in other lands  where the butterflies wings are brighter and the flowers  fairer than here in Old England But I will own to  you Sister Fay that I take pleasure in learning some  thing of the ways and doings and in studying the char  acters of human beings men and boys  Fiket Huge heavy gluttonous creatures that  actually prey upon sheep and oxen and kill them for  food How honid  Kumvabit Do not look so much shocked at the  idea I do not see that it is worse in men to kill sheep  and oxen for food than it is for your friends the spiders  to kill flies The bigger creature needs the bigger prey  and feeds according to its nature Philibert Philimore  the squires fat boy cannot dine as you might on a  drop of sweet juice The scent of the sweetest violets  will not supply him with flesh blood and bones He  would starve upon dew and as for making a breakfast  upon pollen I should like to see his face if such a thing  were proposed  Frisket Yes From what I hear these wretched  human beings are full of all kinds of wants A leafy  bough is a home for me I can feast on the honey in a  flower and then make me a robe of its petals If I  choose to fly higher than my wings will bear me I perch  on the back of a lark and enjoy its music as well as my  ride as I mount up into the sky If it rain I can  shelter me under a mushroom and if I require a light  on a starless night every glowworm is pleased to lend  me his pretty green lamp But mortals cannot be con  tented with pleasures so simple as these They cannot  sleep without a huge house above them nor dress nor  eat nor move from one place to another without such  worry and scurry such scanning and planning such  moiling and toiling as seems terrible to a fairy  KnowOrbit Man is indeed a frail creature full as  you say of all kinds of wants But there is to me  something grand in that wonderful gift of reason which  enables him to supply every one of these wants  Frisket Man cannot fly like a bird nor run like a  hare and if he dare venture into the water at all the  tiniest fish in the brook can excel him in diving and  swimming  KnowOrbit And yet observe how man makes up by  the powers of his mind for all his imperfections of body  He cannot fly indeed for Nature has not supplied him  with wings j but if he choose to mount above the clouds  he forms a huge ball which he calls a balloon and darts  up higher than eagle can fly He has no fins hke a fish  to swim with but man gets wood to float and iron to  swim and fire and water to work his will and his ships  in a long race round the globe would beat any fish in  the ocean If man takes a fancy to dive he dives in a  bell as he cannot hve without air he cleverly carries  down air to the very bottom of the sea Man needs  food of all sorts and he gets all sorts The leaf from  this land and the berry from that the birds and the  beasts the insects and fish he makes all supply his  table Man requires clothing and finds it on all sides  he takes the wool of the sheep the hair of the goat the  fur of the rabbit the skin of the mole the feather of the  ostrich the silk of the worm all he prepares with  wonderful skill to make his curious garments Nor is  this suflScient for man England is not warm enough  for the gTowth of cotton a white down held in the  LEAVES TXOWER AND FRUIT OF THE COTTON PLANT  seedvessel of a yellow flower Hills of this down are  brought in shiploads from fardistant lands in the East  and the West and in a single year enough of it is woven  ill England to cover if needed half the county of York  shire with its towns and churches its fields and farms  and much more than half a million of people Truly man  is a wondrous creature and reason is a marvellous gift  Frisket But man is full of faults as well as of wants  Sad stories of his wicked doings have reached even the  fairies Though the least scratch upon his skin gives  him pain it seems to be his delight to give pain Man  flogs his horses he beats his dogs he hunts the hare he  shoots the bird and even boys horrible to tell will  rob the poor linnets nest and torment the beautiful  winged insects that fall into their merciless hands  Knowahit I fear that this alas is too true I  often wonder how those who so easily suffer themselves  can bear to make innocent creatures suffer But if I re  member rightly fair sister even you yourself carry in your  bag a little brush fashioned of waspstings a touch from  which would make any boy in England start and wince  Frisket I certainly own such a brush but I never  wantonly use my weapon No fairy would ever be  cruel I do but keep the saucy hornets at bay when  they come buzzing about me and I warn off the great  elephantbeetles when they poke their rude horns into  my leafy bower  KnoiVOrhit You remind me of the song   You spotted BTiakea with double tongue  Thorny hedgehogs be not seen  Newts and blindworms do no wrong  Come not near our fairyqueen  Philomel with melody  Singing her sweet lullfiby  Never harm nor spell nor charm  Come our lovely lady nigh  So goodnight with lullaby  Weaving spiders come not near  Hence you longlegged spinners hence  Beetles black approach not near  Worm nor snail do no offence  Philomel with melody c  Theres Will Shakespeares poetry for you again 1  FriaJcet Were it not for that bust up yonder I should  say that Will Shakespeare as you call him must have  been a fair himself  Knowabit laughing You would not have thought  so had you seen him as I did more than two hundred  and seventy years ago in the days of Queen Bess when  he came to this very house on a visit Shakespeare was  a man with a large forehead and a bright keen eye and  a mind brimming over with wit Nothing of a fairy  was he Will Shakespeare was a muttoneating and a  beefeating and a beerdrinking creature there could  be no mistake about that He used to write in this  very room some of the works wliich fill half the laige  l30oks on yon shelf while I sat on his shoulder watching  his pen for his fairywand was a goosequill  Fiket He must have been one whom even fames  would have liked to see I suspect brother Knowabit  that you whispered those fairy songs into his ear  KnowOrbit No they were all Shakespeares own  every word I had not then found out the spell which  has cost me hundreds of years of study by which I can  make myself visible and my voice audible at pleasure  to any of the race of mankind  Frisket Is that a secret which I may know  Knowahit The secret lies in this little tassel which  hangs as you see from my cap When I pull it thus  I can be seen and heard by whomsoever I will I be  lieve that I am the first fairy who ever possessed such  a charm  Fiisket Had I such a chaim I never would use it  I might indeed like to examine man s curious works  and peep into his amusing books that is if I could  take the trouble of learning the ait of reading but  with man himself I should not care to have anything  to do  Knoiuabit Now it seems to me that man is a more  curious and interesting study than any of his works or  any of his writings There is such wonderful difference  between human beings such strange variety in their  characters and their conduct For instance there are  two boys now asleep under this roof Philibert Philimore  the son of the squire and Sydney Pierce his young  guest Never were two beings less alike though both  feed upon mutton and beef The first is always thinking  of self the second always thinking of others The one  is discontented in the midst of luxury the other pleased  with whatever he gets Philibert is illtempered and  peevish while I never yet have heard Sydney utter so  much as a hasty word  FHslcet You surprise me brother Knowablt I  thought that all human beings were inclined to do and  to speak what is wrong that their very nature is to  fall into folly and error just as it is the nature of their  poor weak bodies to fall down if not supported as it is  their nature to need food and sleep and after a little  while to die  Knowahit But just as man seems bom to struggle  against the bodily weakness of his nature to make up  by his wondrous inventions for the want of wings and  fins and claws the lions strength and the deers swift  ness so in some of the race there seems to be a constant  struggle and victory over self There is to me something  very grand and very glorious about such a struggle  Frisket I do not understand what you mean I sup  pose because I am a fairy and have never any trouble  at all  Knowabit I will explain by means of examples  A poor man named Garland who lives at no great dis  tance from Fairydell Hall saw some months since an  idiot boy drowning in a stream Garland plunged in at  once to rescue the child he risked shortening his own  little term of life in ordr to save one who had not even  the power to thank him Here was a struggle and a  victory over cowardly self Garland caught then a  terrible cold on his chest and suffered as mortals only  can suffer He lost his strength for work by day he  lost his rest by night he lost the power to gain bread  for his wife and six children and yet this poor sufferer  never lost his temper never as I have heard uttered  one word of complaint Here was a struggle and a  victory over impatient self Man is a grand being when  he forces earth air water and fire to obey his will and  do his bidding but he is a nobler creature by far when  mastering fear and temper and pain conquering self  rising above his own weakness bearing what nature will  not willingly bear doing what nature will not will  ingly do  Frisket Did not his fellowmortals help Garland as  he had helped the drowning child  KnoWObit Hear the end of my story Frisket The  two boys Philibert and Sydney had each one piece of  yellow gold Now the human race have a curious power  of turning silver and gold into all kinds of things which  they fericy even huge things like cows or even houses  FHsket Whats that whats that you amaze me  Men must have very wonderful wands  Knowahit smiling Men do not make these changes  by the touch of a wand like fairies but by a very  commonplace arrangement which they call buying a  thing never known in fairyland nor amongst any crea  tures except those that are human But to return to my  story Philibert Philimore turned his bit of gold into  toys and sweets for himself Sydney Pierce turned his  bit of gold into comforts for poor Will Garland Sweets  and toys would have been as pleasant to Sydney as they  were to his young companion but the boy like the  man whom he helped had a struggle and victory over self  When I see selfdenial like this selfdenial which we  children of air never can practise mortals shortlived  weak subject to pain and ready to fall as they are seem  to me to be grander nobler happier beings than fairies  Finsket I should like to reward that Sydney I  should like to stir his cup and touch his eyelids with  the end of my wand for  The gilded rod of fairy wood  Gives sweetest taste to oommon food  Makes everything look fair and good  Knowabit You would need to be careful which end  of your wand you used for if I remember rightly fair  sister the green end has a very different effect  Frisket  It gives to food a bitter taste  Makes things look crooked and misplaced  And where it touches spots are traced  Laughing Perhaps Master Philibeit Philimore may one  day have a little rap from that end of my wand or a  touch from my tiny stingbrush to improve his manners  KnoWdhit What does Frisket then think of leav  ing her darling green woods to give as I do lessons to  mortals in a dwelling  Frisket Lessons you never told me that these two  boys had you for their fairyteacher  Knowdbit Philibert and Sydney come each mom  into this study and through the power of my wand I  show them many a wondrous sight in a fairymirror  Flasket Why in this dull close study Why not  in the free green woods Why not take them into the  nest of the bird on the bough the cave of the mole under  giound Why not show them the wonders of Nature  in Natures own quiet retreats  Knowahit That is to me quite a new idea but I  see a little difficulty in carrying it out These boys are  hampered with bodies a great deal too heavy and a great  deal too large to mount into nests and to dive into holes  to creep where a caterpillar creeps or to soar where a  butterfly soars  Frislcet Oh those huge heavy meatfed bodies would  be much in the way I own but I know a remedy for the  difficulty Pulls out of her bag a little box about the  size of a mustard seed This is a box of fancy pomatum  the newest invention in fairyland The tiniest particle  rubbed on the temples gives the mind power for one  single hour to inhabit the body of any creature recently  killed to understand its language and to enter its home  Through the charm of that fancy pomatum the boys  whom you love to teach may buzz through a hive as  bees or roam through underground passages as ants or  bury themselves like beetles or fly through the air as  gnats This is a gift and a choice gift it is from  fairy sister to fairy brother on their first meeting after  a separation of four hundred years  KnowOrhit I am surprised and delighted with your  curious gift but what can I offer in return Accept  the tassel from my cap which will give you the power  to appear and to speak when you will to mortals  Ftisket Nay I cannot rob you of that which has  cost you ages of study to form  Knowabit All the difficulty was to discover how  to form the charm I cari multiply the tassels at my  pleasure and have another at the top of yon bookcase  hidden in the ear of Shakespeares bust  Frisket Such being the case I gladly accept your  gift dear brother though little likely ever to use it I  intend to see these two boys Philibert and Sydney but  never to let them see me I intend to listen to their  words but never to let them listen to mine If I stir  their cups they shall never know what makes the con  tents seem bitter or sweei If I touch their eyelids  they never shall guess what makes aU things bright  with fairy beauty or ugly crooked and dark I will  acquaint myself with mortals but mortals shall not  make acquaintance with me I want to know more of  these strange beings so strong in their weakness in  their power of selfconquering so great whose little life  seems to be a struggle against want pain sorrow and  evil but who when they rise triumphant above all are  greater and nobler than creatures like us who have  nothing but ease and enjoyment  CHAPTER III  INTO THE WOODS  I T was of course a great pleasure to Knowabit  to meet again with his faiiy sister and seeing  Frisket revived his love for the greenwood in   which he had sported in olden times dancing  under the beechtrees by moonlight It was not  difficult therefore for Frisket to persuade her brother to  leave for awhile his study and his books and to wander  with her in the free air with nothing between them and  the glorious stars  But really brother before we start we must look  after your wings cried Frisket How funny you  appear in that black robe of yours which I am sure that  you must have dyed in the squires inkbottle You are  hardly fit to be seen amongst fairies Allow me to  examine your shoulders perhaps a little slit in your  dress would let out your wings Ah here they are  sure enough Ive in my bag the jaw of a rosecutter  bee which I use for slitting and shaping the petals  which I sew up again with silk from the web of the  spider Almost before Knowabit was aware of what  his sister was about she had cut two long holes in the  back of his dress  Ah that looks a little more fairylike exclaimed  Frisket when with tiny fingers which could hardly have  spanned a filbert she had pulled out one after the other  two wings glossy like her own but not nearly so bright  nor so ready to quiver and glance Indeed if I may  venture to say it they looked crumpled like a ladys  dress that has been untidily folded and then left in a  drawer for years Give them a shake a good hearty  shake exclaimed Frisket they are none the brighter  or the better for not having been used since the days of  Queen Bess   Yes it is a curious fact observed the philosopher  Knowabit that all creatures are apt to lose any  faculty which they suffer for long to lie idle Now that  I am going abroad I must rub up the art of flying or  he added laughing I may have to take like mortals  to a coach or a railwaycarriage at last  Knowabit had not yet lost the use of his wirigs  though they felt at first wonderfully stiff He had to  fly two or three times round the study to get them into  good play before attempting a longer excursion In the  meantime Frisket replaced in her violet bag the sharp  jaw of the rosecutter bee which was to the fairy what  a pair of scissors is to a lady and then fastened to her  girdle the curious tassel which had been the gift of her  brother   Now I am all ready for a start V cried Knowabit  flying down from Shakespeares bust where he had rested  for a second or two upon the broad bald forehead of the  poet after pulling the second tassel out of its hiding  place in his ear   Just pull off your spectacles then ciied Frisket   spectacles look as odd on the nose of a faiiy as they  would on the beak of a sparrow  So Knowabit popped his tiny gold spectacles into a  little pocket which he had in his dress and merrily  enough the two fairies flew away through the open  yindow towards the leafy woods which surrounded the  IlaU  A great disappointment was in store for Philibert and  his young guest when they came as usual into the study  on the following morning to meet their fairy friend and  see the wonders worked by his wand Philibert in his  blue velvet dress strutted in first followed by Sydney  in his plain brown stuff one the squires son impatient  for amusement the widows son eager for knowledge  Philibert went up straight to the large rededged  volume in which Knowabit for many years had dwelt  and gave three taps upon it with his fat knuckles as we  rap with the knocker upon a door to ask Is any one at  home Philibert expected the learned fairy to answer  his knock but never a fairy saw he   Why Sydney what ever has become of Knowabit  exclaimed the boy in vexation Try if you can manage  to make the lazy little fellow come out  PHILIBERT AND THK BOOK  Sydney thrice gently tapped the big book but Kjiow  abit was not to be seen  Ill make him attend cried Philibert ready to  stamp with impatience He slapped the book he banged  the book he snatched it up and shook it and then with  a burst of illtemper threw it down on the floor Sydney  quietly picked it up and smoothed the leaves doubled  up by the fall  I am afraid that our kind fairy is tired of us  observed Sydney  Then Im sure that Im tired of the fairy cried  Philibert who like many other selfish people let the  first pause in the kindness of a friend take away all  gratitude for past favours  Sydney was perhaps more disappointed than was  Philibert Philimore for young Pierce had been eager to  question Knowabit on some subjects in natural history   a study of which the boy was exceedingly fond  However Sydney knew that it would be foolish to fret  and wrong to be angry so he only observed as he re  placed the volume on the ledge of the bookcase Per  haps we are meant to find out that though we cannot  have a fairy any longer to teach us we may get a fairys  knowledge out of a book and we may prize the know  ledge all the more if it cost us a little trouble   I hate trouble and I cant bear reading cried lazy  Philibert If this tiresome fairy has taken himself off  he might have been civil enough to have given us notice  yesterday wed better go into the wood and amuse our  selves there till Mary has got breakfast ready Lets  see how the workmen are getting on with papas fine  new summerhouse under the oak  INTO THE WOODS 35  What a delightful old house this is exclaimed  Sydney as the two boys sauntered out together Your  father was telling me yesterday that part of it the part  where the study is was built before the Wars of the  Roses only think what a long time ago The squire  said that Fairjdell Hall has stood so long because in  troublous times walls were made so thick and strong in  case of attack In these days he told me the moat  round the house was full of water not of grass and  shrubs as it is now and there was a bridge over it  that could be drawn up by pulleys so that no one could  pass over the moat without the leave of the master of  Fairydell Hall How strange it must have been to have  lived in those rough old days   They wouldnt have done for you said Philibert  Philimore you are such a weak little chap youd  have been no use in defending a castle Strong jolly  fellows were wanted then not those that needed coddling  and stuffing with codliver oil  Sydney felt the words of his companion to be incon  siderate if not unkind It was no fault of young  Pierces that his health was delicate and his strength  small He had seen enough of the squires fat little  son to know that though Philibert might be far the  stronger of the two if it came to a question of courage  the weaker frame might hold the firmer spirit Sydney  however said nothing in reply but amused himself  with looking up at the strong gateway with the red msl  stain on the stone marking where the portcullis had hung  The portcullis was an iron grating which could be let  down suddenly to stop the entrance of a foe The port  cullis itself like the movable bridge over the moat was  gone now that there was no longer fear of danger a  firm broad bridge had replaced the one and all that re  mained to tell of the other was the rustmark and the  holes in the stone where the iron supports had been  fixed It amused Sydney however in fancy to recall  the past as he glanced up at the massive gateway and  the slits in the wall through which archers sent forth  their arrows against unwelcome intruders long before  guns had been invented   And then to think of Shakespeare himself having  passed under this very arch exclaimed Sydney Ive  thought this noble old place twice as interesting since  hearing of his having paid it a visit   I daresay that youve never read a line out of those  big books with his name on the back of them observed  Philibert as the two boys went on their way down the  green velvety slope which led into the wood   My mother has read to me bits out of Shakespeare   beautiful bits about Mercy being twice blessed and  about vaulting Ambition that oerleaps himself and  falls on tother side And oh now that were amongst  these splendid old trees with their trunks all knotted  and gnarled and the green moss over their great strag  gling roots it seems just the place to sing Shakespeares  song perhaps he made it just here And the joyous  ness of Sydneys heart broke out into music   Under the greenwood tree  Who loves to lie with me  And tune his merry throat  Unto the sweet birds note  Come hither come hither  Here shall he see  No enemy  But winter and rough weather  CHAPTER IV  THE ANTHILL  OME on Sydney will you what are you stop  ping to stare at cried Philibert Philimore   An anthill Oh how curious it is to  look at the little hillock all alive with busy  creatures How they swaim and how active  and lively they are Theres one ant dragging a great  bit of twig I mean great for so tiny a creature to  manage and he cant manage it poor little fellow  Hell leave it hell give up the task No no just  see he has gone up to another ant hes tapping him  with his feelers I daresay thats his way of saying   Please old boy come and help me Oh what fun  there they both are at the twig a long pull and a strong  pull and a pull all together Well done little ants  well done I am sure you work with a will   Horrid ugly little brutes I cant think how you  are so stupid as to care to watch them cried Phili  bert Im sure theres nothing worth seeing in an  anthilL  That is the eonclusion of ignoiance said a bird  like voice from the branch of an old oak which spread  over the green woodland path Philibert and Sydney  both started and looked upwards and whom should  they see seated upon a twig but their learned friend  Knowabit the fairy He looked much as he had done  when the boys had last met him in the study except  that his spectacles had disappeared and that a pair of  long dragonfly wings were folded behind him Sydney  was SO glad to see his fairy again that he uttered an  exclamation of joy   Man continued the fairy is proud of his fine build  ings his grand works of art the houses which he raises  by the help of numberless tools the hammer saw  trowel and axe the crane and the pulley the lever and  the wheel Those little insects which you have the  folly to scorn with no tools but those with which nature  supplies them scoop out long passages and deep tunnels  and raise buildings story upon story buildings which  are far more wonderful and grand in proportion to the  size of the little workers than St Pauls or Westminster  Abbey or the great Egyptian Pyramid itself  You dont mean that wretched anthill cried Phili  bert   I more especially speak of the labours of the white  ant or termite an insect related to the dragonflies and  mayflies rather than to the rustybrown little workers  before you In Africa these builders raise nests that are  sometimes twenty feet in height and so strong that the  wild bull can stand on the top to look out if danger be  near   What a famous anthill that must be exclaimed  Philibert why this little heap of twigs and withered  grass would not support a cat   Pray Mr Fairy tell us more of these curious white  ants and their habits said Sydney   The gigantic nests of these termites observed  Knowabit are each like a populous city with its  palacecell for king and queen in the middle and rooms  round it for their guards and attendants who are always  in waiting These rooms are joined to magazines formed  to hold provisions which look like raspings of wood and  plants but which principally consist of gums and sugar  Near these are the nurseries   Nurseries 1 intenupted Philibert what kind of  creatures are babyants do they wear bibs or pina  fores  Not exactly replied the fairy Ants first ap  pear in the shape of tiny eggs of which there will some  times be as many as eighty thousand in an anthill  From these eggs come little white pupae which are care  fully tended or educated as we may call it by nursing  ants until they are able to take care of themselves   These are the boys and girls of the antcity I sup  pose said Sydney But what are the king and  queen like Do they wear splendid colours to show  their rank   They are rather distinguished by size than by colour  answered the fairy The king of the termites is about  twice as large as one of his soldiers and ten times as  large as a labouring ant   How funny it would be if there were such difier  ences between human beings cried Philibert if  King George haxi been twice as big as the Duke of Wel  lington and ten times as big as his gardener   He would have been a great king indeed observed  Sydney and both boys burst into a merry laugh   Size is not the kings only distinction continued  the fairy in his perfect state he has four laige brown  ish transparent wings but they adorn his majesty for  but a few hours   We may call them his robes of state observed Syd  ney which he has very soon to put off   To die added the fairy   I suppose that the queen whiteant is not nearly so  big as the king as she is the lady said PhUibert   Nay there you are greatly mistaken said the fairy   In the hill of the termites as in the hive of the bee the  queen the great mother is by far the most important  person in the state and the whiteant queen at one  period of her life is of size quite enormous compared to  her subjects She is thousands of times as big as one  of the labouring ants and so large that it is quite im  possible for her to get through the doorway of the cell  which she had entered when comparatively small so  that her palace is also her prison The queen like the  king has for a short period wings or robes of state  as we call them but this is before her great increase  in size   You mentioned soldiers Mr Fairy said Sydney   pray do the king and queen of these termites keep a  standing army of ants   A regular standing army of warriors of about the  size of earwigs who have nothing to do but  to fight Their weapons are powerful jaws  protruding from very large heads and with  these they can inflict very severe bitea If  part of the wall of their city be broken down  out rush the bold soldiers to defend the breach  ready to attack any invader while the la  bourers who have no fancy for fighting take refuge  within   Like the women keeping safe in a castle while the  men are defending the walls observed Sydney   So stanch is th courage of the soldiers said  Knowabit that sooner than quit their  hold on an enemy they will suffer them  selves to be pulled limb from limb   Well done little heroes cried Sydney   When the fight is over continued the  fairy the soldiers leave to the labourers  all the trouble of repairing the walls as  they had done that of building them No  soldier termite will deign to lift a burden nor so much  as look after one of the babyants   Then I should say that except in time of war these  big soldiers are useless fellows observed Philibert   Therefore in the beautiful arrangement of nature  an anthill contains but one soldier to qbout a hundred  workers said Knowabit   I dont think that we have sa much as one soldier  to a hundred other people remarked Sydney   These termites are very curious creatures but I sup  pose that they are very useless ones said Philiberi   They are of exactly the same kind of use to the  Africans as your father s pheasants and hares are to  you   You dont mean to say that any one eats them  cried the fat little boy with a look of disgust Id  rather starve than dine upon ants 1   Whiteants are not only eaten but they are con  sidered by the Africans a delicate dainty said Knowa  bit They have been compared in taste to sugared  marrow also to sweetened cream and paste made of  almonds  Philibert opened his eyes very wide on hearing this  and began to think that a dish of termites might be no  such bad thing after all  CHAPTER V  AMAZONS   RE there many other kinds of curious ants  inquired Sydney   There is a great variety of ants both  foreign and British answered the fairy   We have the dusky the brown the yel  low and the woodant on which you are looking now  and which is commonly called the pismire But in  other parts of the world are found many other remaik  able species amongst them the amazonants which have  the curious distinction of being a kind that capture and  keep black slaves   Oh the naughty cruel little creatures 1 exclaimed  Sydney who had a vivid recollection of what he had  heard from his mother of the horrors of the slavetrade  as practised by men  Insects can scarcely be called naughty or cruel  observed the fairy when acting according to the in  stinct which Nature has planted within them  Piay let us hear something about these amazons  and their slavecatching said Philibert Philimore Did  you ever see them about it   No for I have never myself been out of England  Knowabit replied my wings fairy wings though  they be will not carry me so far as railways and  steamers will carry human beings   You might ask some traveller to pack you up in his  hatbox said Philibert  Sydney observed that the little fairy looked rather  angry at such an impertinent joke and turned the con  versation by saying I suppose that these amazonants  live near the Amazon river the biggest river in the  world which flows in South America   No replied Fairy Knowabit The amazonants  are nearer neighbours they are found on the continent  of Europe though not I believe in this island A great  naturalist called Huber had the opportunity of watch  ing an army of amazons or as he calls them legionary  ants near the Lake of Geneva in the country of Switzer  land on a slavecapturing expedition  And what did he see asked Philibert  Between the hours of four and five on the after  noon of a summer s day Huber saw a column of large  ironbrown coloured ants going at a pretty rapid pace  along a road This column of ants covered a space about  eight or ten inches in length by three or four in breadth   Then there must have been more than a dozen anta  abreast observed Philibert but I suppose that they  did not move all in order like soldiers right foot and  left foot together   Pray go on Mr Knowabit said Sydney   In a few minutes Huber saw the column leave the  road pass a thick hedge and enter a meadow Full of  curiosity to know whither they were bound the natural  ist followed to watch them There was the column of  disciplined insects making its way through the grass  without straggling going steadily on like an army of  men under a human general till it came near a nest of  the negroant which was at the distance of about twenty  feet from the hedge   And how did the negroants receive the invaders   did they show fight asked Philibert Philimore   Some of the negroes were guarding the entrance of  their nest and on discovering the advancing foe dashed  bravely forward to repel them The alarm that an enemy  was coming to attack them soon spread amongst the  negroes more and more of the gallant little ants rushed  out to defend their home then a fierce fight ensued   Oh poor little negroes I hope that they had the  best of it exclaimed Sydney   If Id been there Id have stamped my foot on the  amazonants and killed the whole army at once cried  Philibert  Knowabit smiled at the foolish boast The squires  son would have been afraid of a single wasp and was  little likely to attack a whole column of fiercebiting  amazonants   After a short conflict continued the fairy the  negroes fled to their underground galleries leaving the  amazons masters of the field The invaders now began  making openings for themselves into the anthill and  Huber soon saw the amazons swarming in where he had  no power to follow them In two or three minutes  however they reappeared out of the nest each amazon  carrying a grub or baby negroant and having obtained  what they wanted they returned the same way that  they had come only not in the same regular marching  order   And the poor negroes had been robbed of all their  babies cried Sydney   Not of all of them said the fairy Huber after  watching for some time the homeward march of the  amazons returned to the anthill which they had plun  dered and near it saw a few of the defeated negroes  perched upon the stalks of plants and holding in their  mouths some grubs that had escaped the general pillage   Im glad of that said the kindhearted Sydney   But what did the amazons do with the babyants that  they had carried ofi asked Philibert Did they  make a grand feast and gobble them up   Oh no You forget that the expedition was to  capture slaves not to procure food answered the fairy   Huber was curious like yourself to know the fate of  the little prisoners He found out the nest of the  amazonants and took his post near it to watch what  would happen on the conquerors return to their home  He was much surprised to see a nun»er of negroants  come out of the amazons nest to meet the victors not  as enemies to fight them but like affectionate servants  or friends These negroes caressed the amazons offered  them food and then received from them the little pupae  or grubs of which they took charge doubtless in order  to bring them up as if they were their own offspring   How funny how very funny cried Philibert   Of course these negroants must have been caught and  carried off when they were babies themselves but had  quite forgotten or forgiven the attack upon their old  home   I suppose that the amazons treat their slaves well  observed Sydney Theyve no flogging and over  working in an anthill   The amazons and the negroants live in perfect har  mony together said Knowabit Indeed the ama  zons are quite dependent upon their servants and would  not know what to do without them for the warriors  appear to be no more fit to work for themselves than  are the soldierants of the termites Not only does all  the building work and the nursing of the pupae fall to  the share of the negroants but they even take the  trouble of feeding the amazons The busy little labourers  appear as much masters as servants in the nest and it  has been remarked will even refuse the amazons ad  mission into their own home if they come back unsuc  cessful from one of their plundering excursions  Do these amazons ever carry off grownup negro  ants inquired Sydney   Never are they seen to do so answered the fairy   The babyants only are taken and it is no hardship  whatever to them to be brought up in the amazons  nest   Oh how I wish that we had some of these curious  ants in England exclaimed Philibert it would be  such rare fun to watch them   We have not the amazons here observed Knowa  bit but these very woodants on the hillock at your  feet have been seen to eagerly carry off the pupae of  other ants   I should like to catch them at it cried Sydney   I never thought that common woodants were such  curious creatures   What will you say when I tell you that some ants  may almost be said to have their herds as well as their  servants said the fairy It is well known that ants  press from the aphides a kind of insect very common  upon our apple and oak trees a sweet juice which  nourishes them as human beings are nourished by the  milk of their cows The ants do not hurt the aphides  they gently stroke them with their feelers which are  called antennae and then drink the honeydew with  which those creatures are supplied   Wonders upon wonders cried Sydney   Ants are very fond of liquids continued the fairy   and are provided with little tongues with which they  are able to lap   I suppose said Sydney that the ants do not  keep herds they only catch a what do you call it  when they can find one   Nay replied Knowabit the clever Huber dis  covered that the common yellowant of our gardens keeps  the eggs of the aphis and guards them as carefully as if  they were her owa   Oh doesnt that look as if the ant knew that the  aphis would one day supply it with honeydew cried  Sydney   Huber continued the fairy found in the nest of  the yellowant a number of little eggs most of them  were black as ebony but some were of a clouded yellow  In vain the ants that Huber had disturbed tried to carry  off these eggs the human intruder seized upon both the  ants and their treasure and in order to watch them  more closely put them all into a corner of a box faced  with glass   And what did the yellowants do in their prison V  asked Philibert Philimore   They collected the eggs and placed them in a heap  as if they valued them  highly Part of the num  ber they put into some  earth which was in the  box others they stroked  seemed to lick and fre  quently canied about in  their mouths The ants  seemed to regard these eggs  APiiiDEs OR PLANTLicBL ih grcat affcctlon They  were not anteggs which are white but the eggs of  aphides   And what are the aphides like when these little  cows of the ants are full grown inquired Sydney   There are various kinds of aphides as there are  various kinds of ants said Knowabit The common  oak aphis you may see on this very leaf on which I am  resting my wand   What an ugly creature exclaimed Philibert as the  boys turned their eyes in the direction pointed out by  the fairy and beheld a very repulsivelooking brown  insect   If the ants were to hold a cattleshow observed  Sydney gaily no one would think much of the beauty  of their cows unless they consider it a beauty to have  such a long tail as this ugly aphis seems to have   What you mistake for a tail is a sucker observed  Knowabit which is bent under the body of the  insect and therefore appears behind it That sucker is  much the same to the aphis that the trunk is to the ele  phant Through this long proboscis it drinks up the  juices of the leaf upon which it is resting which juices  will undergo a wondrous change into the honeydew  with which it supplies the ants  CHAFIER VI  THE FAIRY S OFFER  5OW all the time during which Knowabit was  holding this long conversation with the boys  there was a listener whose presence Philibert and  Sydney never suspected though Fairy Frisket  had chosen for her seat the shoulder of the  squires young son covered as it was with thick blue  velvet almost as soft as moss Frisket was quite as much  amused as any of the party regarding as she did with  great curiosity those remarkable creatures called boys to  whom this was her first introduction Perhaps the fairys  feelings towards them were something like what their own  might have been on their first sight of a huge elephant  which they had found more sagacious and goodtempered  than they had expected such a monster to be Frisket  began to suspect that what her brother had said might be  true that she had indulged a foolish prejudice against  liuman beings and that her scorn of mankind had arisen  from her want of knowledge Whenever we are inclined  to despise any being we should try to discover whether  the feeling may not arise from mingled ignorance and  pride  Fairy Frisket was amused not only by watching the  boys but by hearing what her brother was relating Of  course she who had lived for hundreds of years in the  forest knew all about woodants and aphides and every  other creature save man that lived near her fairy haunts  but of foreign creatures Frisket really knew nothing  How was it to be expected that she should seeing that  she had never looked into a book Of lions tigers and  bears except of course the insects antlions tiger  moths and woollybears she never had heard in her life  An elephant would have amazed her The pretty little  fairy as she listened to her brother began to imagine  that pleasure might be found in learning even by a fay  and that the hundreds of years spent amongst the books  in the study by Knowabit might not have been lost  time after all  Only once had Frisket been displeased during the  course of the conversation to which she had listened  and that was when saucy Philibert had joked about  packing up her learned brother in a hatbox The in  dignant little fairy had popped her stingbrush out of  her bag with the intention of giving the plump white  ear which lay so conveniently close to her hand such a  tap with it as would have sent the saucy boy roaring  with paii all the way back to the Hall Sydneys ques  tion by diverting Friskets attention to amazonants  had saved his companion for a time at least from the  danger of which he was so little aware but the fairy  resolved that the saucy boy should not always escape so  easily but that she would tickle his ear or spot his  cheek or stir his tea with the green end of her wand if  ever she should catch him again speaking disrespectfully  of one of her race   All the strange things which you have told us Mr  Fairy said Sydney make me want so much to learn  more How curious it would be to know what is pass  ing in that little anthill at this moment   Would you like to enter it and look about you  asked Knowabit quickly feeling in his pocket for his  tiny pot of pomatum   Thats quite impossible answered the boy smiling  as he glanced down on the little brown hillock which it  would not have been difficult to have jumped over for  English ants build very much more humble homes than  the tennites of Africa   It is not impossible for mind to go where body can  not enter when fancy is powerful said the learned fay   If I but touch your temples with this curious pomatum  tomorrow morning for an hour after sunrise you and  your companion there if he wish it shall inhabit the  tiny bodies of ants and explore wherever ants can go  I am speaking of course of your minds and not of your  large heavy bodies   And what is to become of our poor bodies while our  minds are running about and amusing themselves thus  exclaimed the astonished Sydney while Philibert who  could scarcely yet even understand the strange offer of  the fairy stood staring at him with mouth and eyes wide  open with amazement   Your bodies will remain fast asleep on your beds  while your minds roam free as they so often do in your  dreams   I wont be an ant exclaimed Philibert suddenly  If Mary the nurse should see me in such a shape  running over my pillow shed squash me as sure as a  gun  This exclamation and the anxious alarmed look on  the face of the fat little boy made Knowabit fall into  such a violent fit of laughter that he shook the twig on  which he was seated and nearly knocked over the aphis  His laughter was echoed by Fairy Frisket though of  course the boys could not hear the tinkling sound of her  mirth as she had never yet pulled the tassel which had  been given to her by her brother   Dont be frightened my Mend said Knowabit as  soon as his laughter was over You shall find yourself  an ant in these woods and close to this anthill where no  monster in the shape of a nurse will be near to squash  you   But suppose we should never turn back again into  boys suggested Sydney shaking his head very gravely  as he looked down on the little rustybrown creatures  that were running about at his feet   No fairy spell lasts beyond an hour replied Know  abit At the end of sixty minutes you wiU find your  selves safe and sound in your beds Shall I touch you  with this continued the fairy holding out towards  Philibert the tiny pot of pomatum   I dont believe that you can turn me into an ant or  into anything else with that ridiculous little mustard  seed exclaimed Philibert  Out popped Fairy Friskets stingbrush but her  brother who saw the movement of her tiny hand made  a sign to her not to use it   I have given you already pretty convincing proofs  of my fairy power said Knowabit I make you the  offer but once more Shall I enable you by fancy to  enter an anthill in the shape of an ant  Do it if you can 1 cried Philibert Philimore with a  little laugh of defiance  Almost before the words had quitted his lips Know  abit with a few quivers of his wings had reached  the squires son and touched his temples with fancy  pomatum  O Philibert youre in for the adventure cried  Sydney   Then you shall be in for it too exclaimed Phili  bert again looking frightened If Im an ant you  shall be an ant Oh do pray do let your forehead be  touched The poor little boy was alarmed at the idea  of undergoing such a change all by himself he thought  that no adventure would be so terrible if but his com  panion would share in it  Sydney smiled but hesitated I should like to  consult my mother he said but she would think  me quite out of my wits if I asked her leave to turn  into a woodant   And you cant ask her leave cried Philibert you  know that you heard yesterday that she has been sud  denly called to Scotland to visit her sick brother O  Sydney dont leave me in the lurch it would be so  cowardly it would be so unkind  I should not like to be unkind to any one nor to  desert you said Sydney and yet this is such a very  strange very uncommon kind of affair  Do you doubt me asked Knowabit who had  again taken his perch on the twig have you child of  earth ever found me the child of air lead you into  danger or evil   No indeed replied Sydney frankly I have had  nothing but good from what you have taught me Touch  my forehead if you like Mr Fairy Philibert and I will  visit the little anthillock together  Lightly flew Knowabit towards the boy lightly he  touched his temples with the fancypomatum At this  moment the voice of Mary was heard calling aloud  through the wood Master Philibert Master Philibert  where are you will you never come in for your break  fast  CHAPTER VII  FORAGINGANTS  T was with mixed and very curious feelings that  the two boys at Fairydell Hall thought over  J the occurrences of the morning and the very  strange offer of Knowabit The first thing  which Philibert did on returning to the Hall  was to wash his forehead well with soap and water for  lie had sad misgivings as to the power of the fancy  pomatum though he had so saucily defied Knowabit to  turn him into an ant Notwithstanding this washing  Philibert did not fel easy in his mind and when after  breakfast he and Sydney were together alone in the  playroom with a look of trouble on his plump round  face thus Philibert addressed his companion   I say Sydney do you really think that that horrid  little conjuring fairy it was well that Frisket was not  resent to hear will really turn us both into pismires   I think that it will be as if we had a dream of being  ants and that in this odd kind of dream we shall enter  the anthill   But I dont care a straw for seeing the inside of that  wretched little heap exclaimed Ehilibert and if I  ever went in who knows whether I ever should come  out again Think what fierce little things these ants  are Remember what the fairy told us of terrible  soldiers that would let themselves be pulled in pieces  rather than let go an enemy whom they had caught hold  of Why they might catch hold of me  You forget that these soldiers were termites or  whiteants said Sydney and that we have none such  in England   And those fighting amazons  They too do not live in this country observed  young Pierce it was in Switzerland if you remember  that Huber watched the column on its march   But I dont see why English ants should be better  humomed than African or Indian or Swiss ants said  Philibert they may bite as fiercely as any Knowa  bit told us that those very woodants have been seen to  carry off pupils or puppies or what did he call  them   Pupae said Sydney with a smile  I know what 111 do observed Philibert Mr  Gray is coming to see papa this forenoon hes the clever  fellow with the bald head who knows so much about all  kinds of creatures Ill question him about ants Ill  ask him whether English pismires are quiet gentle good  natured little beasts that never think of fighting or  biting  There was no fear of Philibert Philimores forgetting  his intention for the perils that might be encountered in  an anthiU weighed a good deal on his mind When at  noon the boys entered the diningroom where the rosy  cheeked jovial squire and his grave intelligentlooking  guest were seated at table with wine and fruit before  them Philibert scarcely waited to shake hands with  Mr Gray before blurting out I want you to tell me  everything about ants  Thirst for knowledge thirst for knowledge said  the squire as he pushed the decanter of port towards his  guest as if he thought that Mr Gray might be thirsting  for something besides   The subject of ants is one on which we might talk  all day long observed the baldheaded gentleman there  are so many species of the formica or ant and their  manners and habits are so various The termites  Oh I know all about them already interrupted  Philibert they make houses twenty feet high and  have a big king and an enormous queen and soldiers  that fight like furies I want to know if other kinds of  ants are as savage  A green kind in Australia replied Mr Gray is  said to inflict a wound almost as painful as the sting of  a bee Another is called the fireant from the burning  sensation which it causes Captain Stedman relates that  a whole company of soldiers started and jumped about  as if scalded with boiling water from having got amongst  antnests A writer named Knox in an account of  Ceylon mentions a black ant which he tells us bites  desperately as bad as if a man were burned by a  coal of fire but he adds the consoling assurance that   they are of a noble nature and will not begin unless  you disturb them  The countenance of poor Philibert fell he felt more  frightened than ever and began to regard ants as  creatures much of the nature of wolves only happily  not so large and so strong Sydney who had not lost  his courage quietly inquired But what we should like  most to know sir is whether our own little English ants  ever bite or sting   Some small English ants replied Mr Gray such  as the red and the turf ants are undoubtedly possessed  of a sting but the genus in general is more given to  biting  Philibert uttered a little groan  The ant is decidedly a pugnacious creature con  tinued Mr Gray I had in one comer of my garden  three separate colonies of ants of different species the  yellow Formica flava the negio Foimica fusca and  the red Myrmica rubra and it was not safe for a  member of one of these colonies to cross over into the  territory of either of its neighbours Very savage battles  sometimes take place between armies of diifferent ants  Poor Philibert groaned again which made his father  glance up at him in surprise Why whats the matter  with the boy muttered he Seeing however nothing  to cause him any uneasiness in the fat face of his heir  the jovial squire observed aloud Ive heard that if a  kitchen be infested with beetles a sure way to get rid  of them is to introduce a colony of ants only he con  tinued gaily the remedy might be worse than the  disease   Do you mean inquired Sydney that the ant is a  match for the black beetle a creature fifty times larger  than itself   We must allow for numbers observed Mr Gray   Ants small as they are seem to understand the axiom  Union is strength But a lady of my acquaintance  actually saw a single ant kill a wasp that appeared to  have been by some accident disabled so as to be unable  to fly  An ant kill a wasp exclaimed Philibert daiting  an uneasy glance towards Sydney   Yes even English ants are remarkable creatures  observed Mr Gray but when we compare them to the  termites the whiteants of warmer latitudes their  feats appear as nothing When I was in India he  continued addressing himself to the squire not liking  the bare appearance which the walls of rooms there  usually present I hung up on mine halfadozen good  engravings in gilde«l frames with glass to preserve the  prints One morning it seemed to me that the glass was  uncommonly dull and the frames seemed to be covered  with dust I walked up to them intending to give a  good dusting to them and a good scolding to my care  less native servants when what was my surprise to find  each glass not hanging in the frame as I had left it the  night before but actually fixed to the wall by a cement  put round it by the whiteants The insects had eaten  up the wooden frames for their supper had gobbled up  the greater part of my beautiful pictures showing a taste  for such works of art and as the glass was too hard for  even their strong little jaws they had left each upheld  by the covered way of cement which they had formed  after their usual fashion in order to devour their meal in  peace  The boys looked astonished and the squire observed  Insects with such voracious appetites must be the  plague of your lives in India   Nothing seems to come amiss to whiteants said  Mr Gray smiling they ve no objection to boots shoes  papers clothing We have sometimes to put the feet of  our chests of drawers into saucers full of water to pre  vent the whiteants from eating up their contents   I wonder what such mischievous insects were made  for exclaimed Philibert Philimore  My young friend observed Mr Gray gravely   everything has its own proper place in creation and  some of the insects which we most dislike are valuable  workers for man Whiteants like burying beetles and  other creatures that are no favourites of ours such as  jackals and vultures perform very important seivices  They are the scavengers of nature they clear away  refuse dead animals and decaying matter which if  left to corrupt on the ground would taint the air and  make it unwholesome  Sydney Pierce did not speak but he remembered  what his mother had often told him of the beautiful  arrangements in the natural world by which various  races of creatures are made to conduce to the support  and comfort of others nor had he forgotten Knowabits  account of the poor Africans fixiding their termites to be  delicious food  Tve heard said the squire that in Tropical  America there is a species of ants so useful in this way  of clearing off rubbisi that when an army of them are  seen on the march the people throw open every box and  drawer in their houses that the ants may come in and  make a clean sweep of all the centipedes scorpions and  poisonous reptiles to say nothing of cockroaches and  beetles that are apt to hide there in holes and crannies  Even rats and mice lizards and snakes are said to be  hunted out and destroyed by these wonderful ants  That kind of ants is called foraging and belongs  to the genus Eciton remarked Mr Gray These  foragingants sally forth in immense hosts their columns  are sometimes a hundred yards in length 1   Oh they beat the amazons out and out exclaimed  Philibert   And it is a curious circumstance that these armies  of foragingants seem to be eoiumauded by regular  officers continued Mr Gray about one officer to each  twenty common men I beg pardon I should say  common ants  And have the officers gold epaulets on to show  their rank asked Sydney playfully   No they are distinguished by their large white  heads which go nodding up and down as they run along  by the side of their men I mean ants to see that all  are marching in proper order   Well of all wonderful creatures that ever I have  heard of I think that ants are the most wonderful  exclaimed Philibert They seem these foragingants   to be like famous housemaids aiid better than house  maids if they clear the rooms even of snakes But he  added looking more grave I shouldnt like to watch  the little fellows while they were busy at work for fear  lest if they could not find cockroaches and lizards and  snakes enough to please them they should take a fancy  to me   I should certainly advise you to take the precaution  of getting out of their way said Mr Gray with a  smile The natives it is said when the insect army  draws near run out of their dwellings and leave them  for awhile to the ants They know that the foragers  will make themselves very much at home and help  themselves without need of assistance to whatever they  can find When the insects have finished their useful  work they march off and the people return to their  houses finding them all the more comfortable and safe  from the visit of the foragingants   If a man should happen to come across one of the  armies of ants what would he do inquired Sydney   If he were a sensible fellow he would take to his  heels and be off replied Mr Gray   I think that it is time that you and I should be off  too observed the squire rising from table for we  have a good long ride before us you know And well  follow the fashion of these foragingants by clearing the  table he added pulling towards him a dish of beautiful  grapes of which he and his guest had just been par  taking Sydney and Philibert my lads heres a  bunch for each of you and with a goodhumoiued nod  to his son and young guest by way of goodbye the  squire followed Mr Gray to the old stone porch which  led into the courtyard of Fairydell Hall where two  saddled horses were waiting for the gentlemen in charge  of a mounted groom  CHAPTER VIII  FRISKET EXPLORING  JHE squire was much too courteous to have  pulled the ripe bunches out of the china dish  as roughly as he did had he known that a  lady was reclining in the midst of the fruit  resting so lightly upon it as not to rub the down from a  single grape We may wonder that after all that Fairy  Frisket had said to her brother of her dislike for man  kind and her love for a free airy life in the woods we  should find her in a dish of grapes in the diningroom of  Fairydell Hall But the curiosity of the little lady had  been fairly aroused having seen something of the human  race she was inclined to see a little more especially as she  had not foimd it to be as utterly bad as her fancy had  pictured Fairy Frisket began to think that a large old  house might be quite as great a curiosity as a rooks or a  jackdaws nest especially as some of the building materials  must have been brought from a very great distance  Frisket had spent hours in the earlier pait of the day  in flying about the hall or loinning up the edge of the  staircase banister with those tiny fairy feet that did not  disturb a particle of dust upon the carved oak The  pictures which hung upon the walls had greatly puzzled  the fairy she had had her doubts at first whether the  portrait of Lord Bacon in his highcrowned hat and large  ruffle were not really alive only she had never heard  of any race of men who had heads without bodies and  though the ruffle might be a kind of huge white wing  it seemed to her scarcely suited to fly with Closer  examination convinced the fairy that the picture had  nothing in it of life What pleased Frisket most was  a window of stained glass which she found at the end  of a corridor It would have been the prettiest of  sights could any one have seen it to have beheld  the little fairy fluttering in the coloured rays that came  streaming through the diamondshaped panes her gos  samer robe and transparent wings now catching tints  of rich crimson then of purple and then of deep  blue  Bent upon exploring every comer of the curious old  house Frisket had actually found her way into the  kitchen but the sight of a great joint of raw beef hang«  ing up and the scent of ham and of cheese had soon  sent the fairy flying away in disgust She had lingered  for a few minutes however chiefly attracted by the  huge fire the first fire be it remembered that Frisket  ever had seen   Have these strange mortals mused the fairy   managed to imprison within those black bars the wild  Willothewisp which I have sometimes seen at night  dancing over the moor even I never could catch it Or  are these red flames that go roaring up that dark pass  age flashes of lightning kept in a cage  That single kitchenfire gave Frisket a greater icjea of  the power and skill of mankind than anything else in  the large old dwelling had she seen a lucifer match  lighted it would have struck her with amazement   Is that big mortal with a face like a poppy feeding  that shining thing with lumps like stones but blacker  than beetles Is it alive that it darts upward and  curls around them and licks them with bright red  tongues and utters such a joyous crackle as if it enjoyed  its meal exclaimed Frisket as she watched the cook  at the very commonplace occupation of putting on coals  The little lady drew nearer to examine the fire more  closely till the heat of the flame began to scorch her  transparent wings and annoyed by this and the savoury  scents of the kitchen the fairy took her flight from the  place to rest herself after her wanderings amongst the  cool purple and green grapes that appeared upon the  diningroom table  When the squire had disposed of the fruit as we have  seen between the two boys Fiisket returned to her  former perch upon the soft velvet of Philiberts dress  resting her head against one of the yellow locks of the  little boys hair Of course she curiously examined his  linen collar as it lay so close under her eyes but she  thought it as coarse as we might think a piece of rough  matting and said to herself that mortals were a very  long way indeed behind the gossamer spiders   I say Sydney you dont get such jolly giapes as  these at your home observed Philibert Philimore as he  plucked at his fine large bunch   I seldom get grapes of any sort replied Sydney   and therefore I suppose I enjoy these all the more  The fruit was indeed no small treat to the delicate  boy whose natiually feverish temperament made the  cool juicy fruit especially refreshing He only wished  that his dear mother could have shared the rich purple  bunch which he held in his hand  The boys sauntered out of the diningroom into the  large old hall panelled with oak and hung with ancient  armour stuffed foxes heads and stags horns This  hall was an especial delight to Sydney whose fancy  eopled it with the knights and ladies of old As Phili  bert and his companion crossed it they met Mary com  ing from the little postern entrance with an empty jar in  her hand   Little Simon Garland has just brought back the jar  which the soup was sent in Do you wish to see him  Master Philibert asked Mary Though she addressed  herself to her young charge she glanced at Sydney as  she spoke   Theres no use in our seeing him said Philibert   he has been given money physic and soup I dont  know what he can want more   Perhaps he would like us to give him a kind word  too and ask after his sick father observed Sydney  Pierce His mother had taught him that it is not only  help but sympathy that the poor should have from those  who are richer and his own heart told him that a smile  and kind word will often give more pleasure than a  present  As Philibert had nothing more amusing to do he  went with his guest to the little lowarched door at  which Simon Garland was waiting the squires son eat  ing his grapes as he went and throwing down the skins  on the polished oak floor an untidy proceeding which  offended the invisible fairy  Frisket had as we know seen very little of human  kind In the squires comfortable home every one  except perhaps his young guest appeared sleek and  well fed the squire himself was jovial and stout Phili  berts cheeks though not rosy were plump and round  the looks of every one of the servants showed that they  were not stinted in regard to mutton and beef Trisket  haxl an idea that almost all mankind were heavy and  fat and great was her surprise when human poverty for  the first time met her view With wondering pity she  looked upon little Simon with his face so thin and so  pale his neatlypatched clothes and the coarse shoes  that had been worn so long as to be iast patching and  mending   Alas poor child he looks like a dry peapod said  the fairy to herself I hope that there are not many of  the human race like him  Could Frisket have glanced into many of the wretched  abodes of the poor she would have seen sights of sorrow  that might have saddened even the blithe little fairy   How is your father Simon asked Sydney kindly  while Philibert stood by eating up his grapes as fast as  he could   Fathers the better for the soup thank ee master  replied Simon a grateful smile lighting up his thin little  face But he hant got rid of the fever yet he lies  a long time awake o nights the cough tries him so  and hinders his sleeping   And makes his mouth feel hot and dry I daresay  said Sydney who knew too well what it is thus to  suffer   Mother aFays puts a cup of water by fathers bed  side at night just to cool his lips Taking a drop now  and then he drinks it all up afore morning  Frisket noticed that Sydney glanced down at the bunch  of grapes which he held then again at the boy then once  more at the sweet juicy fruit She guessed the thought  which was passing through the mind of Sydney and  watched with keen interest the first struggle against self  which she had ever yet had an opportunity of seeing  SYDNEY AND 8IUON   I say Sydney theres our dinnerbell observed  Philibert turning on his heel  The little glutton exclaimed the fairy he has  eaten half a cluster of grapes already and now he is  eager for that heavy animal food  The moment that Philiberts back was turned Sydney  held out his own tempting bunch of grapes to the sick  mans son This will refresh your poor father more  than the water he said and hunying away without  waiting for thanks he joined his little companion  CHAPTER IX  THE BRUSH AND THE WAND  CLL done Sydney Pierce well done ex  claimed the invisible fairy I shall stir  your food with the golden end of my  wand you shall enjoy your dinner to  day it shall be the sweetest that you  ever ate in your life I could almost wish that I my  self were a child instead of a fairy that I too might  have a battle to fight and a victory over self to win  that I too might give up something to make a poor  sufferer happy This must be a nobler kind of pleasure  than any that fairyland can afford 1  Philibert usually took his meals in his playroom  where he was waited upon by Mary To the play  room therefore the two boys went at the summons of  the bell accompanied by the imseen fairy still perched  upon Philiberts shoulder A very savoury scent pro  ceeded from the dish at the top of the table which was  spread with a milkwhite cloth on which appeared  plates knives forks and spoons laid for two The  savoury scent was not agreeable to Fairy Frisket it  reminded her of the kitchen and the great joint of raw  meat which she had seen hanging up there But if the  odour annoyed the fair lady it had a very different  eflFect upon the two boys   I say theres something good in that dish I can  tell by the smell crieu Philibert Whip off the  cover Mary were both as hungry as hounds  Sydney was the more hungry of the two as he had  not damped his appetite by eating half a pound of ripe  grapes Very tempting to him was the appearance of  the nicelybrowned cutlets with the rich thick sauce  around them which met his view when Mary had lifted  the cover from the dish  I say this is good exclaimed Philibert grasping  his knife and fork and holding them upright while his  fat little fists rested on the table Cook hasnt given  us veal cutlets before for ever so long   Veal is that veal asked Sydney in a tone that  betrayed a little disappointment   Yes jolly nice it is Dont you like it said  Philibert   I daresay that I should like it very much replied  Sydney but the doctor forbade my ever eating veal   Oh the doctors a donkey 1 cried Philibert and  youre not under his thumb at Fairydell Hall Just  eat away like a man it wont do you a bit of harm  Sydney hesitated for a moment and then said with a  little effort My mother would not wish me to take it  A pink tinge rose upon the boys cheek as he spoke   But your mother is not here any more than the  doctor and I won t tell of you cried Philibert laugh  ing as he plunged his fork into the nearest brown  cutlet   Ill do just the same as if she were here she trusts  me said Sydney And again Frisket exclaimed Well  done at this second little victory over self   But you dont mean to go without your dinner I  suppose said Philibert and he put a large piece of the  cutlet into his own mouth   Perhaps I can have something else only I am  sorry to give trouble replied Sydney looking at Mary  who was bringing in a dish of green pease  Oh hell fare like a fairy for once exclaimed  Frisket who was pleased at the idea of her favourite  boy giving up what she considered the shocking habit  of feeding upon meat But the next words of Sydney  undeceived her  Perhaps there is a little cold meat in the house   Certainly Master Pierce theres sure to be a bit  left from the cold shoulder of mutton Ill fetch it  directly said Mary and she quitted the room She  was ever willing to serve Master Sydney who is such  a thorough little gentleman always civil and kind to  every one as the maid observed to the cook when she  asked her for the mutton   Well Sydney you are a poor creature if you dare  not so much as venture on a bit of nice veaJ for fear of  making yourself sick cried Philibert munching as he  spoke The colour on Sydneys cheek rose higher than  before he looked as if he were about to make some  sharp retort to the boy who could despise him merely  for being less hearty and strong than himself but he  pressed his lips tightly together and uttered nothing in  reply Again the fairy marked a silent victory over  self  But Frisket felt no need for the same selfcommand  in a fairy indeed she had taken the idea into her tiny  head that having once come amongst young mortals  she might do great things in the way of bringing them  into good order Twice she had refrained from touch  ing up Master Philibert with her woe brush made of  wasp stings but now she gave him a brisk tap on the  lobe of his fat little ear   Waaa yelled the boy starting up from his seat  and clapping his hand over the place  Whats the matter asked Sydney in surprise unable  to help thinking that Philibert was indeed a poor  creature for giving such a roar like a baby   Something has stung me some horrid ugly beast I  waal howled Philibert Ah if he could but have  seen the face of Frisket when he gave such a description  of a faiiy 1  Sydney goodnaturedly jumped down and ran to the  rescue to find out the offending creature That Phili  bert had been hurt was plain enough for the big tears  were running down his plump cheeks   I cant see a wasp anywhere nor any other insect  said Sydney after a search  I daresay its one of those dreadful foragingants  or amazons or termites or something cried Philibert  quite forgetting in his pain that none of these insects  are natives of England I daresay it has hid itself in  my clothes He jumped up and violently shook his  blue dress Perhaps it is running down my back  O Sydney O Mary the maid had just returned with  the meat do look for the horrid thing that has stung  me right on the ear  Sydney looked and Mary looked amongst the boys  clothes under the collar under the sleeves about the  table below the table but of course they looked in  vain Frisket did not choose to pull her tassel and  they might have searched to the end of their lives be  fore they discovered the fairy  If Frisket had hoped to mend the manners or improve  the temper of Philibert Philimore by that rap on his ear  flO THE BRUSH AND THE WAND  she was to be disappointed The boy returned to his  veal cutlets in a mood like that of a wounded bear  while Sydney ate his cold mutton with a serene con  science and the sauce of a good appetite Young Pierce  would have preferred the daintier dish but he was  happy in the consciousness that he was obeying his  mother and much enjoyed his simple food   I cannot bear to touch flesh with my fairy wand  murmured Frisket for veal and mutton are food which  no fairy could ever abide but if anything eatable appear  on the table Ill make the boy who gave away all his  grapes taste something sweeter than anything which  has ever yet passed the lips of a mortal  The meat course was succeeded by a greengage tart  a help from which was placed by Mary before each of  the boys Little guessed they who stood on the edge of  Philiberts china plate taking care not to dip her delicate  little feet into the juice of the fruit as she stirred it with  the green end of ier wand Frisket then flew off like a  butterfly and without alighting plunged the golden tip  for a second into the midst of Sydneys supply   What a horrid taste this tart has exclaimed Phili  bert turning up his nose with a look of disgust when  he had taken the first spoonful of the fruit tart before  him   Why Master Philibert you always like greengage  tart better than anything else said Mary   I dont like this it tastes like soap ugh exclaimed  Philibert pushing back his plate   Do you find anything wrong in the tart Master  Sydney asked Mary  Sydney had just been thinking that he had never  before in his life tasted anything half so nice All the  sweetness of a bunch of rich grapes seemed to be gathered  into every greengage He only smiled however and  replied I cannot say that I find anything wrong  Thus encouraged Philibert tried another spoonful but  he could scarcely manage to swallow it Taste it  yourself he cried fiercely to Mary pointing to the  remains of the tart in the dish  Mary tasted and thought it excellent it had not been  stirred by the fairy  Ill tell you what Master Philibert said Mary  youve been making yourself sick by eating such a  quantity of rich veal cutlet I believe Master Sydneys  mamma is quite right veal is not wholesome for children  You do not like that nice tart because youre not in a  humour to like anything  I dont like soap exclaimed Philibert fiiriously  flinging himself backwards on his chair and kicking  upwards at the table which action set the glasses jingling  and the fairy laughing while neither Sydney nor Mary  found it easy to keep from smiling Perhaps there was  some truth in the guess of the maid at least some of  my readers may have found themselves inclined to find  fault with viands which hungry little children would  enjoy from having played the glutton like Philibert  Philimore Oreedineas often has the same effect as the  green end of the fairys wand   I wonder how you can behave so like a big baby  Master Philibert said Mary to her spoiled young charge   Im really ashamed that Master Sydney should see you  in your tantrums You first roar and cry out that you  are stung when theres nothing near that could hurt  you and then complain of the nicest food instead of  being thankful that you have dainties when others can  scarcely get bread Im sure that with all your play  things and pleasures you ought to be the happiest boy  in the world   Tm not happy at all 1 growled Philibert the fairys  greentipped wand was at that moment touching his eye  lid Im tired of all my playthings they are so ugly  and stupid and I dont see what pleasures I have I  dont like this great dull old Hall its the most gloomy  place in the world  Sydney uttered an exclamation of astonishment   Oh 1 it seems to me to be so grand so beautiful every  thing that I see here I admire so much I can hardly  fancy any place more delightful than Fairydell Hall  Of course Friskets wand had touched his eyelid but  it was the goldentipped end Ah little reader whether  you dwell in a cottage or a palace a shop in a street or  a castle amid woods how do you view the objects around  you Are you pleased with and thankful for your  blessings or inclined to find fault with everything around  you Contentment is the golden end of the wand and  discontent is the green one Wonderfiil is the difference  made in every object by the touch of the one or the  other  CHAPTER X  INSIDE THE CITY  fP you believe Sydney that anything will really  come of Knowabits touching us th that  curious fancypomatum as he calls it was  Philibeiis anxious whisper when on the  evening of that day the two boys were pre  jiaring for bed  The fairy has always kept his promises replied  Sydney so it seems as if we ought not to doubt him  though it is difficult to imagine being turned into an  ant  The pot of pomatum was so very very small  observed Philibeit  Ah but perhaps a very little fiincy may go a  long way said Sydney  Philibert was very restless and uneasy and could not  get to sleep for some time perhaps owing to a feeling of  fear and wonder perhaps from his having eaten too  plentifully of veal cutlet Sydney slept long and serenely  but awoke at last with a sensation of the greatest amaze  ment The fresh cool air of early mom was around  him the forest boughs waved above him the morning  star was growing pale in the clear blue sky and in the  east a bar of red gold showed where the sun was about  to rise What astonished Sydney for no expectation  beforehand could prepare him for a sensation so exceed  ingly funny was to find himself quite close to the earth  and so small that he could have run up a blade of grass  or have hidden himself under a daisy   Oh 1 exclaimed Sydney in amazement what would  my mother say if she knew that her boy was running  about upon six little legs no bigger than pinpoints  If I am asked how Sydney in his new shape managed  to utter such an exclamation I must own that it puzzles  me to give an explanation It is true that he had a jaw  and a tongue but whether he was able to produce with  them any sound which could be heard even by an ant  the most learned naturalist scarcely could undertake to  decide That ants have some kind of language under  stood by their companions at least that they are able  in some way to ask for food or for help or to give  tidings where a prize may be found seems clear to  those who have watched them closely Some believe  that this language is expressed by the motion of their  feelers or antennse that it is something like the method  by which deaf and dumb people speak on theu fingem  while others suppose that these same quivering antennae  are actually to ants what ears are to us and convey to  them sounds too faint to reach mans less delicate sense  As Fairy Knowabit is never likely dear reader to turn  either you or me into emmets we shall probably never  know exactly the nature of this ant language Had we  been ever so close to Sydney when he uttered his ex  clamation of wonder we should certainly not have heard  it and we should have seen in him nothing but a very  commonplace rusycoloured pismire such as may be  found running about in hundreds of woods in England   O dear Sydney Pierce is that you cried an ant  close beside him Isnt it horrid to feel so dreadfully  small Im so glad that you are in the scrape as well as  myself   We had better make the most of our time while we  are so small observed Sydney the ant Theres our  hill Id no notion that it was so big why it looks to  me now as large as one of the Pyramids of Egypt How  our little companions here ever managed to raise it so  high puzzles my brain  I dont fancy going in cried Philibert He was  not possessed of a very stout heart either as a boy or a  pismire I dont like at all being jostled in a crowd  and Im sure that of all bustling busy places in the  world an anthill must be about the worst   Aie you in want of a guide gentle strangers said  a pismire approaching the visitors and laying her little  quivering antennae on Sydney in a manner which he felt  to be the perfection of antpoliteness I see that you  do not belong to this community and it might be agree  able to you if I were to conduct you through a few of  the chambers and galleries in the city before us  Sydney was astonished at a pismire having such an  elegant manner and address he little knew that it was  Fairy Frisket herself who had chosen to animate the  form of an ant bent upon having a little frolic with her  human companions in this their strange new position   We should be very much obliged to you indeed Mrs  Ant if you would kindly show us the way and intro  duce us to the gentlemen and ladies inside the city  replied Sydney or they may think that we have no  business to go wandering about in the place  Why where are the little holes which we saw  yesterday with the ants running in and out of them  cried Philibert Philimore   Ive heard observed Frisket that human beings  put up shutters on their windows and close their doors  at night and much in the same way these woodants  stop up their passages when darkness comes on that  they may labour or rest in peace and quiet in their  homes They are not like the brown ants that love to  go abroad in the night and who used to be supposed to  be especially fond of moonshine But see as it is  dawn the good people of the city are pulling down their  shutters and opening their doors which shows that they  expect the day to be fine   Would they keep their passages shut up then  asked Sydney if they expected the day to be wet  They keep their passages well closed in rainy  weather observed Fairy Frisket ants have a great  dislike to the rain   I should not think that such a heap of twigs straw  old grass little bits of wood and dried leaves could keep  out the slightest shower observed Sydney   You show that you are not an experienced pismire  said Frisket gaily You may notice that the whole  hill before us is skilfully rounded in shape so as to carry  off water and so constructed that even violent rains  can soak in but a very little way But there is an  opening from which two active ladies have just succeeded  in dragging several fragments of wood will you please  to walk in young gentlemen there is no need to knock  here before you enter  In trotted Fairy Frisket on her six little legs closely  followed by Sydney but Philibert hung back he was  afraid to enter what he considered to be a little black  hole  Sydney was astonished at the length of the passages  which he now traversed in company with the unknown  fairy His eyes being of course ants eyes he had no diffi  culty in moving about in what to human beings must have  seemed to be utter darkness He passed a great many  woodants who were exceedingly busy at their various  occupations too busy indeed to pay any attention to  him Each was working  by herself without inter  fering with her neigh  bours or appearing to  need any direction or aid  Sydney soon discovered  that what he had called  an anthill was a great  building great compared  to the size of the builders  with story raised upon  story long galleries and  ranges of rooms   What are those ants  about that I see running  down from the upper  stories canying little white  burdens asked Sydney  stepping backwards to let them pass for they seemed  in such haste that had he stood in their way they  might have run over his little body   They are the nurses looking after the comfoit of  the pupae the babyants replied Frisket The  weather promises to be so hot that the upper stories  will be too warm for the dear  little pets their nurses know  that they will be cooler on the  SE groundfloor or down in the eel  LARYA or ANT larS   What careful little nurses exclaimed Sydney   And when the weather grows cold will they carry the  children upstairs   Up they go in damp chilly weather nurses and  pupae together They know well enough that then it  is not healthful to live on the ground or under the  ground But you have as yet seen but a small part of  the city come this way Mr Ant and take a peep at  the tunnels and the galleries hollowed out yonder   These are what we should call vaults observed  Sydney as they took a downward direction through  passages formed in the earth itself with wonderful skill   low themselves but leading to a large middle chamber  which was crowded with ants I know that Squire  Philimore has beercellars winecellars and coalcellars  beneath his fine house but human beings seldom care  themselves to live in such dark low places These ants  seem to enjoy burying themselves alive   Alive you may well say answered the fairy for  they are lively enough and busy enough and dont care  for plenty of light and air as human beings are said to  do But these woodants go to sleep in the winter  huddled up in their little cells and not requiring to eat  or drink until the warm sunshine in spring calls them  up to labour and pleasure again  CHAPTER XI  THE ANTLION  E will now return to Philibert Philimore who  t had remained on the outside of the anthiU  feeling it must be confessed very nervous  and uneasy in his strange new position  The ants soon began to swarm in numbers  out of their city and Philibert had to move from his  place again and again to prevent his being jostled out of  it by his active little neighbours He was aware of a  very strong and peculiar scent from the anthill which  reminded him that Knowabit had once informed him  that vinegar can be made from ants   These rustycoloured little fellows must be different  indeed from those African whiteants thought Phili  bert Im sure that if these were dished up no one  would ever think them like sugared cream or sweet  almond paste   Get out of my way you snail you slug What  are you standing and staring and doing nothing for  cried an angry pismire as he pushed past Philibert  Philimore   Theres more of the vinegar than of the sugar in his  temper at least thought the poor little boy in the  shape of an ant   Come you here lazylegs and help me said  another pismire who was trying in vain to pull along a  bit of dried grass at least four times as long as herself  Philibert stood stockstill He did not choose to  work and very hurting to his pride it was to be bullied  by an ant   We dont keep idlers here cried the impatient  pismire If you dont work well bite off your head  The hint was enough Philibert rushed at the dry  bit of grass and pulled and tugged at it for his life He  had never laboured so hard before   Where are we to take it asked Philibert when  stopping for a moment to take breath   Into the hill of course theres one of the walls  that needs repairing Pull the grass right into that  doorway said the ant  Philibert had been afraid to venture into the anthill  in company with Sydney Pierce and now to go into a  dark place where he would probably lose his way and  that with a pismire who had thoughts of biting off his  head was so exceedingly unpleasant that the poor little  fellow could not make up his mind to do it Philiberts  end of the burden was nearer the hole than that held by  his new companion but by a sudden movement he  managed to change its position   What are you about you stupid cried the pismire   We dont want to lay it across the door but to carry  it in   I want you to take your end in first replied Phili  bert secretly resolving that he would not enter at alL   Youre an awkward pismire if there ever was one  cried the little labourer turning his end of the burden  however so as to drag it first into the hole  No sooner had the woodant disappeared under the  dark little doorway than Philibert dropped the bit of  dry grass and took to his I must not say heels but  his six little legs and ran oflT at a tremendous pace con  sidering the smallness of their size Nothing could stop  him in his course not even limips of clod almost as big  as peas A hairy caterpillar lay in his way Philibert  was over her in a moment The boy ant was running  for his life for he was dreadfully afraid that one of his  new companions would bite off his little black head   More haste worse speed says the proverb and poor  Philibert Philimore was to prove the truth of the saying  Little thought he as he scampered away from the hill  of hidden pitfalls or of secret foes who lie in ambush for  ants Running over a sandy spot down tumbled poor  Philibert into the trap which had been carefully prepared  to catch such prey by the insect called an antlion«  What was his horror to find himself suddenly plunging  down the sandy pitfall almost rolling into the powerful  jaws of the dreadful creature lying in wait at the bottom  LYING IN WAIT  This creature was somewhat of the shape of a fat  gardenspider but with long slender mandibles to catch  at its prey Philibert certainly did not stop to examine  its appearance closely for having tumbled into the pit  all his efforts were now directed to scrambling out of it  again The antlion was no more inclined to let a  dinner escape than Philibert himself might have been  It was indeed quite unable to run after Philibert for  the antlion though possessed of six legs can only use  two of them for walking and that but to drag itself  slowly backwards so that it is clear that nature never  intended this creature to overtake its prey in the chase  But in the sand of the pit which it has digged the ant  lion possesses a terrible weapon for if the insect cannot  run it can jerk and fling as Philibert soon found to his  cost As the poor boy ant struggled up the steep sides  of the pit even the movement of his little legs brought  loose sand tumbling about him while the antlion from  behind sent a dreadful shower of it after him sand  grains being to an ant much what sharp stones would  be to a boy Philibert stiniggled scrambled sUpped  backwards then by dint of frantic efforts got a little  way up the side of the pit when a blow from a sand  grain knocked him down again almost into the jaws of  the hungry antlion Happily at that moment the hour  during which the fairy spell lasted expired and Phili  bert awoke with a scream leaving the body of the  pismire to serve as the antlions dinner  CHAPTER XII  BLACK SPOTS  HY what on earth is the matter Master  Sydney exclaimed Mary running into the  room of her charge in alarm at the sound of  his scream Philibert half raised on his  elbow in his bed was staring around him and  rubbing his eyes looking bewildered and frightened Did  anything hurt you to make you scream like a baby   You would have screamed too if a horrid spider had  been going to gobble you up cried Philibert fiercely  Mary burst out laughing Where is this spider  said she I should not have thought that a brave  young gentleman would have been frightened out of his  wits by a poor little insect   Little do you call it cried Philibert it was  bigger than myself and so fat 1  Mary laughed more merrily than before You must  have had a fimny dream said she   Ive not been dreaming at all you know nothing  about the matter cried Philibert who was highly  offended and not a little ashamed He was sufficiently  wideawake now to remember that he would get into a  great scrape with Knowabit if he mentioned to any  one except of course to Sydney who was himself in  the secret anything about his intercourse with the fairy  Philibert could say nothing about fancypomatum to  Mary nor tell her the extraordinary adventure which he  had had in the shape of a woodant Not being able to  ve any explanation of his conduct Philibert felt ex  ceedingly vexed at having been heard to utter a scream  and then woids which must he knew have sounded ab  solute nonsense He almost danced about the room with  passion when while she was helping the little boy to  dress himself Mary remarked with a provoking smile   I shall take very good care little master that cook  never sends up veal cutlets again for your dinner  Very sulky and illtempered was Philibert during all  the time that he was washing and dressing the soap  flew one way the sponge another and the boy would  scarcely stand still for a moment to have the parting  made down the middle of his curly head of hair Mary  set down all this temper of course as the eflect of eat  ing veal cutlets As savage as a bear the squires son  met his companion Sydney in the playroom before  breakfast while Mary went for the cups and saucers the  fresh milk butter and eggs  The face of Sydney was bright with goodhumour  Fairy Frisket who was hovering near had again touched  his eyelids with the golden tip of her wand  O Philibert began the smiling Sydney what a  curious amusing hour we two spent with the ants 1   Curious amusing indeed 1 exclaimed Philibert with  anger I dont know what ycm may think it but  think it anything but amusing to crawl about upon six  legs and then to be nearly devoured by a spider How  dared you leave me in the lurch   I leave you What do you mean asked Sydney   I only went into the anthill and I thought of course  that you were coming in too Why did you not follow  that most polite little ant  Philibert did not choose to reply Because I was too  much frightened to venture although that would cer  tainly have been the most honest answer to have given   I did not choose he muttered to go into that horrid  dirty hole   I assure you that the place was neither dirty nor  horrid but extremely curious and interesting said  Sydney But do tell me of your adventures Phili  bert I cant imagine how you managed to get into the  web of a spider   I never said that I got into a web replied the  squires son as tartly as if he had been accused of getting  into a jail I tumbled down a horrid crumbling pit  fall at the bottom of which lay a fat gray spider with  dreadful long feelers which jerked up such a lot of sand  after me that as fast as I clambered up I tumbled back  again almost into its gaping jaws   Oh it must have been an antlion not a spider  exclaimed Sydney with animation My mother has  told me all about it and she said that though called a  British insect it is seldom if ever found in this country  but it is common enough in France There is no crea  ture that I have ever wished more to see   I wish that you had had to do with it instead of  me I am sure that I saw much more of it than I  liked growled Philibert Philimore   The antlion has a strong flat head said Sydney  recalling what he had been taught with one of its  legs it will manage to place upon this head a load of  sand which it chucks upwards with wonderful strength  tossing as if it were a little bull That curious insect  will carry up out of its pit even a stone two or three  times the weight of its body Fancy what a head it  must have  Philibert gave a little grunt as if he took no great  pleasure in hearing of the antlions strength or skill and  muttered Its the ugliest beast that ever I saw in my  life  But its beautytime is to come observed Sydney   Mother says that the antlion makes for itself a case or  coffin of sand fastened together by threads of its silk  puts a silken web over the whole and then goes to sleep  as the chrysalis of a caterpillar does turns into a pupa  and bursts out at last with four beautiful gauzy wings  and looks very much Jike that lovely creature the  dragonfly   I dont care to hear anything more about it its all  stupid nonsense to say that that horrid little monster of  a spider can ever turn into a creature with wings ex  claimed Philibert The illtempered boy added many  other foolish words to a speech which showed great  ignorance now abusing the antlion now his innocent  companion for leaving him to the spider as he persisted  in calling the insect and now Knowabit the fairy  for having dared to rub upon him that horrid fancy  pomatum  I have mentioned that Fairy Frisket was present in  the room of course listening to all that was said and  very indignant was the little lady at the conduct of the  squires spoiled boy Frisket had taken into her tiny head  the idea that she could by means of fairy punishments  bring Philibert Philimore into much better order reform  his temper and mend his manners Certainly the boy had  seemed none the better for the rap from the fairys sting  brush nor for the spoiling of his greengage tart but  Frisket who had had no experience in teaching and who  was as positive in her own opinion as ignorant people  often are was resolved to keep to her punishment plan  Perching upon Philiberts shoulder once more at every  silly passionate word which he uttered the fairy tapped  his cheek or nose with the green end of her wand leav  ing wherever she tapped a tiny black spot behind  Sydney Pierce did not notice any change in his young  companion because he was not looking at Philibert As  the squires son was so much out of temper Sydney  thought it better to leave his passion to cool and trying  to pay as little attention as possible to Philiberts bad  language young Pierce was examining the pretty pic  tures which ornamented the walls But when Mary re  entered the playroom with the breakfast on a tray she  had hardly set it down on the table before she exr  claimed in amazement Why Master Philibert what is  the matter with your cheek  Her exclamation made Sydney turn round and look   Its all sprinkled with black speckles he cried  Philibert pulled out his little silk handkerchief and  gave the fat cheek such a vigorous scrubbing that he  made it as red as fire But this had only the effect of  making the speckles appear on a scarlet ground instead  of rather a sallow one   Dear dear dear exclaimed Mary each dear  being uttered in a tone of louder alarm its a black  rash coming out on your face Thats not measles nor  chickenpox nor smallpox oh if my father the  chemist were but here I I never heard of black spots  except except in the plague  Philibert stared at Mary with his eyes and mouth  wide open then rushed in terror to a little mirror over  the mantelpiece and commenced rubbing his face again  with more energy than before   You had none of these spots when we met finst in  the morning said Sydney who little guessed that the  ugly marks had been left by foolish and naughty words  Ah little reader if Fairy Frisket with her greentippe  wand were perched on your shoulder would that merry  face of yours never be dotted with ugly black spots for  naughty talking   I must speak to the squire directly about this said  Mary as she hastened out of the room feeling seriously  alarmed She met the jovial master of Fairydell Hall at  the door of his study   Please sir may I speak to you about Master Phili  bert said Mary in a tone so anxious that it awoke a  little alarm in the father   Nothing wrong with the child I hope cried the  squire  I dont know sir indeed replied Mary but  Master Philibert is so odd He has been exceedingly fmc  tious has Master Philibert both yesterday and today   He wants a little more of the rod and a little less  bread and butter observed the squire with a good  humoured smile   He awoke this morning with such a scream sir and  cried that he was going to be eaten up by a spider bigger  than himself   Dreaming dreaming laughed the squire the  little chap had taken too hearty a dinner   And just now continued Mary a black rash has  broken out on one of his cheeks and the side of his  nose   A black rash 1 reechoed the astonished squire  every trace of a smile leaving his face This must be  looked to at once and striding into his study Mr  Philimore rang the bell loudly and in half a minute  rang it loudly again which brought Thomas up in such  haste that he nearly fell over the coalscuttle which  careless Sarah the housemaid had left in the passage  Thomas mount Brownie at once and ride off to  the town for the doctor 1 cried the impatient squire  Tell Dr Grim that Master Philibert has been taken  ill and I beg that hell come and see my son directly  Then while Thomas hastened off to the stable to get  Brownie saddled and bridled the squire himself strode  up the oak staircase to the playroom taking two steps  at a time   A black rash as sure as a gun I never saw any  thing like it before cant imagine what can cause such  a symptom 1 cried the squire as he examined the fat  little cheek which Frisket had powdered with spots The  squire looked grave Sydney looked grave Mary looked  grave and poor Philibert who began to fancy that  something very dreadful must be going to happen was  ready to burst into a roar  Fairy Frisket was astonished at all the alarm and  trouble which she had occasioned by merely making a  few little black dots on a mortals cheek Cowslips did  not mind being speckled the ladybird never seemed a  bit the worse for the spots on her wings Fairy Frisket  we must remember had never known sickness the  word symptom was like Greek and Hebrew to her  she had not an idea what measles smallpox or chicken  pox could possibly be  Im really sorry that all these moitals should vex  themselves so about a little speckling said the fairy to  herself Ill not dot Master Philiberts face any more  let him talk what nonsense he may  The fear that he had some horrible illness coming on  took away all poor Philiberts appetite for his breakfiast  he ate scarcely quarter of a thin slice of bread and  butter and his nice fresh egg went untasted away But  as we know the fairys spells never lasted very long  and almost as soon as Mary had cleared the breakfast  things away all the black dots passed away from the  skin of her charge causing almost as much surprise by  their disappearance as they had done by coming at all  I dont think that there can be much the matter  with you Master Philibert after all said Maiy with a  little sigh of relief   I say Sydney well go out into the woods cried  Philibert as he and his companion strolled out of the  playroom together I want to find the pit of that  horrid spider or antlion as you call it thats not a  bad name after all for when I was an ant it was just  like a lion to me   Oh I should very much like to see it 1 exclaimed  Sydney it would interest my mother so much to hear  all about that creature and its curious pit  Wont I smash the horrid little beast wont I  crush it and stamp upon it cried Philibert grinding  his teeth as he recalled in a spirit of fierce revenge what  he had suffered in his fright I may here observe and  I beg my young readers to remark whether they do not  find my observation to be a true one that they who are  the most cowardly are very often the most cruel also   You would not pimish a poor little insect for acting  according to its instinct cried Sydney It was no  more wicked in the antlion wishing to eat you when  you were in the form of an ant than it would have been  for Squire Philimore to have shot you had you been in  the form of a hare  I do hate the antlion though however you may  choose to stand up for it and Ill kill it said Phili  bert fiercely  Happily for the antlion the boys in vain searched for  its pitfall though they had no difficulty in finding the  anthill Sydney looked down on the swarming pis  mires with their black heads and rustycoloured bodies  with a very curious feeling of interest and amusement   I never knew half of your cleverness and industry  you fine little fellows he cried till I paid you a  visit in your home Nor had I a notion how very  polite and pleasant you can make yourselves to a guest  No lady in her drawingroom could have had nicer  manners or a prettier way of talking than my little  guide  Sydney Pierce had no idea that his courteous com  panion on six legs had not been an ant but a fairy  I cant say much for the mannera of woodants  said Philibert shrugging his shoulders at least dont  call it civil to say If you dont work well bite off your  heai  CHAPTER XIII  THE doctors visit  HILIBERT had had no appetite for his breaks  fast but partly on that account after hisi  ramble in the woods he had a tremendous  appetite for his dinner   I wish that one oclock would come he  had exclaimed at least half a dozen times before the hour  actually arrived and he and Sydney sat down to a  capital dinner of roastbeef which was to be followed by  rich plumpudding  Philibert greedy as well as hungry seized the first  help for himself like a very illmannered boy as he was  and was just going to put a large piece of beef into  his mouth when footsteps were heard in the corridor  the door was opened and in stalked the thin black  haired hooknosed solemnlooking gentleman dressed in  black whom he knew to be Dr Grim The medical  man was followed by Squire Philimore   Come here to the doctor Philibert said the squire  in a tone which made his son feel that the summons  must instantly be obeyed Slowly and very unwill  ingly wishing Dr Grim a thousand miles off the hungry  boy put down his fork and approached the medical man  Dr Grim felt Philiberts pulse examined his tongue  looked at his cheek I do not observe any trace of a  rash such as you mentioned he said to the squire in a  peculiarly deep and solemn voice such as he might have  sjioken with had he been telling a patient that he was  going to die  It went off as suddenly as it came on sir said  Mary to whom the puzzled squire looked for an ex  planation  Again the doctor solemnly laid his cold fingers upon  Philiberts fat little wrist Not a bad pulse he  gloomily observed whatever he might say his manner  was gloomy Pray continued Dr Grim addressing  himself to Mary have you noticed anything peculiar  about the young gentleman   He has been exceedingly odd sir in his ways both  yesterday and today   What had he for dinner yesterday inquired the  doctor while poor Philibert hungry as a raven was  stealing furtive glances at the dinnertable to which he  longed to return   Veal cutlets sir replied Mary   Veal cutlets most unwholesome 1 said the doctor   that would account for any derangement of the system  Did the boy eat anything besides   Greengage tart sir but he scarcely would touch it  he said that it tasted like soap  The doctor nodded his head very gravely That  shows that something was wrong he observed   Wrong with the tart not with me exclaimed  Philibert who could not restrain his impatience even in  the presence of his father and the medical man for whom  he had a considerable awe   The tart was as good a one as ever was baked  observed Mary I tasted it myself and Master Pierce  enjoyed it very much but then he had not touched the  veal cutlets  Again the doctor nodded his head like one who begins  to see his way clearly   You said Mary that my boy awoke this morning  with a scream observed Squire Philimore   A dreadful scream sir as if he were frightened out  of his wits and yesterday he roared out at dinner  Master Pierce heard him as well as myself He cried  out that something had stung him on the ear but  though we searched in every direction nothing could be  found that could possibly have hurt him  What a blab she is muttered Philibert if shed  had such a stinging as I had shed have roared out her  self like a bulL   I am sure that Master Philibert could not have felt  well this morning he was so very fidgety and cross   I was quite well and I am quite well never better  in my life exclaimed Philibert angrily trying but in  vain to draw his wrist from the cold grasp of the  doctor s fingers   My dear young patient said Dr Grim in his slow  solemn way you are not competent to judge whether  you are or are not in good health Loss of appetite in  one so young is not a favourable symptom  Im as hungry as a hound as a whole pack of  hounds cried out poor Philibert desperately   But you had a distate for a nice greengage tart and   as Ive heard from your father you scarcely touched  your breakfast this morning It is clear that you are  not as well as we wish you to be but I think here the  doctor turned and addressed himself to the squire I  think that we can soon put matters to rights I will  send a little medicine to be taken at night  Philibert made a wry face he knew too well by  experience what the doctors medicine was like  And in the meantime continued Dr Grim our  young patient who is of somewhat too full a habit must  be kept to very light and simple diet He must be  given nothing but weak beeftea barleygruel and toast  and water  Such a sentence was dreadful to the famishing boy   I want my roastbeef he exclaimed and but for the  presence of the squire and the doctor Philibert would  have stamped and roared with disappointment and pas  sion   Weak beeftea and barleygruel repeated Dr Grim  with grave decision and he must not fail to take the  medicine at night Any one can see that the poor child  is suffering the tears were rolling down Philiberts  cheeks but he was only suffering from disappointment  hunger and passion   I am glad however that you seem to think that  nothing very serious is the matter with my poor little  man said the squire I thought myself that his com  plaint was only from a little overfeeding   Veal cutlets he must never touch again observed  the doctor   Sydney my boy Im afraid that your roastbeef is  getting cold said the kindhearted squire turning  to wards his little guest who had been patiently waiting  till the doctor should leave before beginning his meal   Set to your dinner and eat plenty theres no fear of  your taking too much And you Marj go to the cook  and see about the beeftea and the barleygruel at once   I hate gruel I never can touch it maynt I have  plumpudding at least almost sobbed out Philibert   Plumpudding echoed the doctor looking as he  might have done had his patient asked for a dish of  poison Beeftea and gruel and not much of them  must you have for your dinner if you touch either  meat or pudding Ill not be answerable for the conse  quences  And perhaps the doctor was not very far wrong after  all though of course the effects of Fairy Friskets sting  brush and wand had misled him as they had misled the  squire and Mary for none of his learned books had made  any mention of fairies Poor greedy Philibert was pro  bably none the worse for a day of fasting for he was as  the medical man had observed of too full a habit being  usually inclined to eat more than was really good for  his health But a miserable day was passed by the  spoiled and selfindulgent child who was tortured with  actual hunger so that he almost envied the natives of  Africa their dish of whiteants or termites  CHAPTER XIY  Id be a butterfly  HILIBERT PHILIMORE had gone to sleep  hungry and he awoke more hungry still  never before in the course of his life had the  squires pampered boy felt such a craving for  food It did cross his mind that it must be  a dreadful thing to be poor and hungry every day in  the year Philibert now could feel some real pity for  the Garlands the sick father unable to work the thin  children who for months had not known what it was to  eat until they were satisfied for what Sydney and the  squire had liberally bestowed had chiefly gone to pay  rent It would be an excellent lesson for many a spoiled  child who cares nothing for the sufferings of the poor  were he to feel as Philibert did for one day how keen  are the pangs of hunger  Philibeit was not only inclined to be more ready to  pity but perhaps for the first time he had known  something of the feeling of gratitude Sydney had  been very kind indeed to his young companion when he  believed him to be unwell and knew that he was pining  for solid food Sydney had read aloud in the evening  till his throat had grown weary and hoarse and had  then tried to amuse Philibert in every other way that  he could think of Sydney had even given away to the  squires son the present which he himself had been pre  paring for his mother a beautiful little model of the  old gateway of Fairydell Hall which he with great  labour and care had cut out of old corks gumming  little bits of moss over parts of it to give the effect of  ivy No brother could have been kinder to Philibert  than Sydney had been no sister more gentle and  thoughtful his conduct had had a far more softening  effect upon Philibert Philimore than Fairy Friskets  stingbrush or even her greentipped wand  Oh Mary will you never get breakfast ready  exclaimed the impatient boy I can eat at least half  a dozen eggs so mind that you bring me plenty T   Indeed Master Philibert I doubt that you should  have one before you see Dr Grim again  But I must and will have one cried Philibert   I should like one as big as my head Do make as  much haste as you can for I am dying of hunger 1  If Philibert was only allowed to have one egg and  that not a large one for breakfast he made up for this  by his vigorous foray upon the slices of bread and butter  Mary could hardly spread and cut them as fast as her  young charge ate them and Sydney could not help  laughing to see how the loaf wb disappearing under the  attacks of Philiberts appetite The squires son enjoyed  his breakfast as much as if the fairy had stirred his food  with the golden end of her wand and Mary felt satisfied  that nothing was now the matter with her tioublesome  charge  After breakfast the two boys went out as usual into  the delightful grounds which surrounded Fairydell HalL   I should like to have another hunt for that horrid  antlion said Philibert Philimore  Happily for the little gravedigger as Sydney  called the insect his sandy pitfall was not to be found  and Fhilibert amused himself with running races on the  lawn with Sydney Pierce more to his own enjoyment  than to that of his guest for Sydney though strength  ened by his visit to Fairydell Hall waa yet too delicate  to be fit for any violent exercise While Sydney was  stopping to recover his breath pressing his hand against  his side Philibert caught sight of a beautiful butterfly  and instantly gave chase to the insect  Now butterflies are as may be supposed special pets  of the fairies who look upon them much as ladies look  upon their favourite poodles or parrots As it happened  this butterfly was not only a pet of Frisket but actually  on its way to a grand assembly of butterflies and moths  to which that fairy had invited it We may imagine  then the displeasure Mith which Lady Frisket who  chanced to be hovering near saw the squires son rushing  after her guest now almost clapping his hand over the  fluttering insect now baffled and panting hurrying in  some other direction after the prey just escaped from his  grasp Faiiy Frisket flew to the rescue and puisuing  the boy as the boy pursued the insect gave Philibert a  violent hit with her stingbrush on the back of his hand  just as he had succeeded in capturing the butterfly prize  Philibert utttaed a howl not only of pain but of  passion and punished the unfortunate insect for the deed  of the fairy by dashing it fiercely to the ground  Oh dont kill it dont hurt it exclaimed Syd  ney Pierce running to the spot to plead for the beauti  ful creature Why should you be so angry with the  pretty butterfly It never did you any harm   Harm I if youd been stung as Im stung youd not  say that exclaimed Philibert who looked ready to  stamp with fuiy upon the poor injured creature at his  feet   The butterfly never stung you it has no sting  said Sydney   I got stung in catching it Philibert replied   That was surely no fault of the butterfly it never  asked or wished you to meddle with it observed Syd  ney with a smile  Philibert was in no mood to bear even the mildest joke   Ill not have you laughing at me he cried fiercely   and why should you dare to interfere if I choose to  smash all the butterflies in the world So saying  Philibert stamped his cruel foot upon the helpless crea  ture and killed it   Its too bad to torment or kill any of Gods crea  tures just because they are weak and cant defend them  selves ciied Sydney whose gentle and generous spirit  always rose against wanton cruelty My mother says   I dont care a straw what your mother says and 1  wont have you lecturing me a little wretched puny  creature that you are cried Philibert all the more ex  cited with passion from Friskets having given him a  second sharp rap this time across the bridge of his nose   I am your guest Philibert Philimore said the in  dignant Sydney who would never himself have insulted  any one while on a visit to his home   I know that well enough retorted Philibert hold  ing his nose and half dancing with pain glad enough  you are to come from your smoky den of a house and  get our good roast beef and plumpudding instead of  endless codliver oil  The insolent taunt stung Sydney to the quick had  his mother been at her home to receive him he would  have asked the squire to let him instantly return thither  but her absence in Scotland tied him as it were to the  dwelling of the meanspirited inhospitable boy who  loved thus to insult his guest Sydneys heart seemed  to rise into his throat and it was certainly no feeling of  fear that prevented his returning the taunt with a blow  But Sydney remembered that Ae that ruleth his spirit  is greater than he that taketh a city and restraining  himself from uttering even a retort he turned from the  squires spoiled son and went off into the shade of the  wood Sydney could not have trusted himself at that  moment to utter a single wotd  Few things calm a troubled spirit so much as a quiet  saunter amongst green trees and the other fair objects of  nature Sydneys anger had been very hot but it soon  cooled down when he found himself alone under the  spreading beeches All was so peaceful and beautiful  there A sense of wrong however rested on the mind  of the boy Sydney remembered how hard he had tried  to make Philibert happy how he had given to him  what his own dear mother would have valued so much  how he had been as kind and thoughtful towards the  squires son as if he had been his own brother It is  hard to bear rudeness under any circumstances but  doubly hard when it comes in return for unselfish kind  ness Sydney as he sauntered along the mossy wood  land path hummed to himself one of his mothers  favourite songs which had been written by Shake  speare   Blow blow thou winter wind  Thou art not so unkind  As mans ingratitude  Thy tooth is not so keen  Because thou art not seen  Although thy breath be rude  Heighho sing heighho unto the green holly  Most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly  Then heighho the holly I  This life is most jolly   Freeze freeze thou bitter sky  Thou dost not bite so nigh  As benefits forgot  Though thou the waters warp  Thy sting is not so sharp  As friend remembered not  Heighho sing heighho unto the green holly  Moat friendship is feigning most loving mere folly  Then heighho the holly  This life is most jolly  Sydney was just finishing the last line of Shake  speares song when he saw something on the path before  him which attracted his attention It was neither  forestflower nor lichen nor curious insect It was a  pretty little pearl brooch which had been a birthday  present to Philibert and which the squires son con  stantly used to fasten his collar   Ah theres Philiberts brooch the jewel that he  is so proud of wearing exclaimed Sydney aloud as he  picked it up from the moss in which it was lying em  bedded He must have dropped it while he was hunt  ing for the antlion here in the wood Well if he loses  it he gets what he deserves I dont see why I should  take the brooch to such a thankless illtempered boy  let it lie there till he find it Im sure I dont care if he  never does Sydney dropped the jewel on the moss  walked two or three paces from the spot and then paused  Am I doing what is right he said still speaking  aloud little dreaming that any one could hear him   Am I not showing a spirit of mean revenge and act  ing as I would 710 like another to act towards me  No no I must forgive as I would wish to be forgiven  myself Ill take tlie brooch to Pliilibert directly lie  may now be in trouble from its loss  Again Sydney stooped and picked up the jewel but  as he raised himself what was his astonishment at be  holding poised upon a long curling fernleaf the most  beautiful little creature that ever had met his gaze  8YDNEY FINDS THE BKOOCiJ  There was Frisket herself with her fluttering gossamer  robe her tiny wand her transparent wings and th  golden feEissel which she had just pulled hanging from  her bright girdle In his start of delighted surprise  Sydney again dropped the brooch   Child of earth said the musical voice of the fairy   well may you gaze with surprise upon her whose form  was never before visible to one of your race I have  twice seen your triumph over self your pity for the poor  your obedience to your mother and now your generous  forgiveness towards one who so little deserves it I have  watched your control over your temper your watch over  your lips your compassion for the helpless and weak  You have made me break my firm resolve never to show  myself to one of the race of mankind I thank you for  pleading for my poor little guest I thank you for show  ing that mercy which seems so little natural to the human  species  Confused blushing scarcely knowing how to answer  so singular an address from the bright little being be  fore him Sydney replied to Frisket I am very glad  indeed lady fairy if I have done anything to please you  But I think that there must be some mistake I could not  show mercy to a fairy I can hardly suppose that any  friend of yours could ever need my help or my jleading   No indeed replied the smiling Frisket who was  amused at such an idea no fairy friend would ever  require aid from any poor mortal But a fairys guest  might and did tle poor butterfly crushed by your  cruel companion was on her way to visit me by special  invitation I have summoned all the butterflies and  moths that haunt the garden and pleasuregrounds of  Fairydell Hall to meet me at Violet Dell a retired spot  in this wood They will there recite their own deeds  whether as caterpillar grub or winged creature and  give an account of their labours in providing homes for  their future offspring I have promised to the insect  that shall be found to excel the rest in industry and  skill that as a reward I will tip her wings with gold  I will then feast all my guests upon honeydew and  dance with them a round in the air under the sunshiny  sky   What a pretty sight it will be exclaimed Sydney  to whom this butteiflies ball with a fairy for hostess  seemed something delightful and strange   Would you like to see it asked Frisket   Oh above all things cried Sydney   Then you shall take the place of my poor little  favourite said Frisket and for one hour animate the  beautiful form out of which that cruel boy stamped the  innocent life  Sydney began to consider whether he would wish to  accept the unexpected offer of the fairy It might be  well to see or to sing about a butterflys ball and a  grasshoppers feast but to enjoy an insects pleasure at  the risk of sharing that insects fate would be quite a  different thing Fairy Frisket was however too quick  in her movements to allow much time for reflection  Sydney merely caught a glimpse of her fluttering robe  as she flew towards him pomatum in hand and before he  could utter a word a word in human language I mean   down dropped his form on the moss and fern where  it lay for an houi under a tree wrapped in the deepest  slumber At the same moment the poor butterfly which  Philibert had crushed suddenly spread its bruised and  injured wings animated by the mind of the boy The  insect flew towards a retired space in the wood all sur  rounded by hawthorn holly and larches garlanded by  wild roses and blackberry sprays and carpeted with moss  so green that any one acquainted with the tastes of  fairies must have guessed that it was one of their  favourite haunts So thick was the brushwood so  tangled the foliage that the clearing in the wood was as  much shut out from the view of man as if it had been  fenced round with marble walls No human foot had  ever left its print upon that soft carpet of moss In  springtime the air of the fairy dell had been fragrant  with violets from which Frisket had given it its name  the violets had long ago faded but pretty little pinlc  convolvuli tinted the ground and the tall purple fox  glove shook its speckled bells osrer the grass In spring  the nightingale had sung all night long from a hazel  bush while fairies danced to his music the nightingale  had long been silent but the squirrel leaped from bough  to bough and cracked the nuts of the hazel and the  robin hopped lightly on the spray and uttered ever and  anon that cheerful note which would be heard even when  winter should have come to strip the trees of their  foliage A little bubbling runlet of water very shallow  and very clear flowed through Violet Dell singing its  own soft song making the moss still greener and kissing  the pretty wild flowers that trembled over its brim The  spot was quiet and lovely well suited for a fairy queen  to hold her court in when she called around her the  brightwinged creatures of the air It was such a spot  as Shakespeare may have had in his minds eye when  he wrote his wellknown song   I know a bank whereon the wildthyme blows  Where oxlip and the nodding violet grows  There sleeps the fairy queen there sleeps some times o the nights  Lulled in their flowers with dances and delights  CHAPTER XY  BUTTERFLIES MEETING  H this is delightful this is enchanting cried  Sydney Pierce in butteifly language about  which hangs the same mystery as about that  of the ant None of the Lepidoptera species  such is the long name given to the race of butterflies  and moths except the deathshead moth is I believe  known to utter any sound which human beings would  call a voice Butterflies do not roar or bark or bray  or mew they neither screech nor sing but we may  suppose that like our friends the ants the fourwinged  Lepidoptera have some way of speaking to each other  with their quivering antennae  It was indeed very delightful to Sydney upon that  bright morning in August to be able to spread wings  to the light breeze and to bask in the glowing sunshine  Who that can imagine the pleasure enjoyed by a butter  fly during a life which is sometimes measured but by  hours would wish to shorten that little span of delight  It had been amusing to Sydney to find himself in the  shape of a pismire able to enter and to explore a dark  anthill But how much greater was his enjoyment  now when he rose aloft in the air and joined the gay  throng of Lepidoptera that were hurrying from all quar  ters to join the fete given by Fairy Frisket 1  Near the little sparkling stream the fairy sat on her  mossy throne to receive her guests The throne was  bedecked with every variety of wild flower that could  be found in wood hedge or mead at that season  every one of them spangled and tasselled with dew  drops that sparkled like manycoloured jewels A rose  beetle beautiful insect like a great emerald in his  armour of glossy green had crept to the place to act  as the fairys footstool he feared not the pressure of  her light foot Fairy Knowabit sat at his sisters side  to assist her judgment and Sydney saw with pleasure  the familiar form of his acquaintance the learned fay  But even Knowabit had come to the butterflies feast in  brighter garb than that in which Sydney had seen him  when the home of the fairy was the large rededged  book in Squire Philimores study A gossamer robe of  light green half covered Knowabit s students gown  though of course the robe being thinner than gauze it  was easy to see through it every fold of the garment  beneath it A tiny white plume of thistledown adorned  the fairys black cap and being stuck on one side of  it gave him quite a dashing appearance  What an assemblage of butterflies came fluttering  through the air at the call of Fairy Frisket Sydney  had had no idea that there were so many kinds of  winged creatures in England as appeared now in Violet  Dell Some indeed came from various counties and  except on such an extraordinary occasion as this would  not have been found together But a meeting of the  Lepidoptera held by a fairy is not a thing that happens  every day or even every year  There were the fritillaries the silverwashed with  the under side of its burnished green wings streaked with  silver and the pearl bordered fritillary ornamented  with delicate spots like the gems of the sea The  brimstone and clouded yellow butterflies appeared gor  geous in orange and gold looking all the gayer by their  contrast to the smaller tawny heath butterflies that had  fluttered to Violet Dell from their home on the nearest  common A host of little blue butterflies appeared  seeming to the fancy of Sydney like moving azure  blossoms There were the chalkhill blue the pretty  holly blue and the dear little Bedford blue the tiniest  of British butterflies From the top of an oaktree  came down in stately majesty the purple emperor and  the pretty paintedlady followed close behind him The  handsome cabbagebutterflies the white greenveined  and orangetipped left the squires kitchengarden to  appear at the court of the fairy There Sydney beheld  the magnificent peacockbutterfly with large eyelike spots  on its wings and the beautiful dappled tortoiseshell  throwing into the shade the tribe of modest little brown  skippers which some think to be connecting links between  butterflies and moths Moths be it known a genus  called by the learned Phalaena may be known from their  butterfly brothers and sisters by having no little knobs at  the end of their feelers These little knobs like the but  tons of Chinese mandarins serve to distinguish the more  dignified butterfly from the more lowly moth It would be  a great mistake to suppose that all moths are graytinted  dull little creatures or all butterflies splendid and gay  SOME OF THE VISITORS TO VIOLET DELL  One of Fairy Friskets most splendid guests was the  red admiral that to grace her feast appeared long  before his usual season his rich dark wings streaked  with broad bands of red and white Of course there  BUTTERFLY AND MOTH  were plenty of white butterflies whose appearance is  familiar to every one who has lived in the country  but Sydney had never seen before one yellow and black  flutterer large in size and very peculiar in shape her  hinder wings seeming to be lengthened into tails from   It must have been owing to a fairy spell that such a variety of the Lepidoptera  species appeared in the month of August Some butterflies have both a spring and an  autumn brood The copper butterfly it is said has three broods in the year But  my young readers unless specially invited by Fairy Frisket must not expect to find  all of her guests in any one month of the year any more than in any one county of  England The brimstone butterfly for instance though common in the south of  England is not frequent in the midland counties It is found in gardens and flelds  sometimes on a sunny morning as early as February or March  which no doubt the handsome swallowtail butterfly has  been given its name  With the butterflies came a vast host of moths  Sydney saw the  goldtailed moth  and the small  ermine moth  whose larvae so  destroy the  beauty of our  hawthorn trees  in the summer  Then came the  lackey moth  whose caterpillar had worn so gay a livery of blue yellow  and white With these appeared the small gray and  gieen oakmoth and the beautiful tigermoth in robes  of scarlet white and brown the creature that in its  caterpillar state is so very well known by the name of  woolly bear It is strange that a creeping bear should  thus change into a winged tiger  But I must not linger now to describe all the butter  flies and moths or even to name them Sydney wished  that as in parties given by the human race there were  some one to announce each guest by name on his or her  first arrival The little hour during which the power  of the fancy pomatum lasted was not nearly long  enough to enable Sydney to hear all the speeches  made by various members of the gay meeting I shall  but give the few which he heard with curiosity and  amusement as one by one the butterflies and noths  preferred their claims to the prize offered to them by  the fairy  First came the coarse stout goatmoth which brushed  hastily past butterfly Sydney leaving a veiy disagree  able odour behind her The manner of the goatmoth  was forward and bold she seemed to think that she  had a right to speak before every one else perhaps on  account of her age for she had been a larva caterpillar  for three whole years before she had become a moth  This is a very long life for an insect and had given the  goatmoth an opportunity of doing a great deal of cater  pillar work  Ive just come from my home in the old willow  tree cried the goatmoth and I wish lady faiiy  that you had chosen some better hour for your meeting  for every one who knows my habits is aware that I hate  flying about by daylight 1   I am sorry to have put you to inconvenience lady  Goatmoth said Fairy Frisket politely as she bent  down her head over a leaf of sweetbrier which was to  her what a scentbottle and a fan are to a lady The  pretty fairy was too wellmannered to express what she  felt but she wished that the goatmoth would say her  say quickly and fly back again as fast as she chose to  her old willowtree  I have little doubt that I shall both win your  favour and gain your prize continued the goatmoth  coming much nearer to the fairy than was at all plea  sant to a being possessing such a delicate sense of smell   Ive famous jaws that is I had when I was a larva   and theres not one of the Lepidoptera that better  knew how to use them The goatmoth looked proudly  around her as she spoke as if to defy the whole host of  butterflies and moths to match her exploits If you  fly to my old home lady fairy youll see how Ive  tunnelled and bored making passages for myself now  just under the bark now right inwards to the very heart  of the tree I should not wonder the goatmoth went  on if the very next gale blew the willow right down   Ive so weakened it with my boring and then I  may boast that a single caterpillar has laid a tree low in  the dust  A murmur of surprise was heard through the assembly  of butterflies and moths   I was not only clever in digging and boring said  the goatmoth but skilled in housemaking also I  wish that I could have carried hither my curious cocoon  but Ive not half the strength now as a moth that I  had when I was a caterpillar I fonned my cocoons  I had more than one of woodchips of various sizes  nicely fastened together upon a silken framework You  observe that my boring in wood supplied me with plen  tiful store of building materials besides the elegant silk  with which nature had furnished me in common with  many other caterpillars   I have had the pleasure of seeing one of your in  genious cocoons lady Goatmoth said Fairy Frisket   it was so large that if cut in twain I could have used  it for two footbaths This was the fairys way of de  scribing the size of a cocoon about two inches long for  not being learned like her brother the fairy knew  nothing of the terms of measurement used by mankind   I am glad that you have seen it cried the goat  moth I hope that you noticed its beauty  To own the truth replied Fairy Frisket the  cocoon appeared to me to be rather rough as if it were  made of sawdust   But the inside the inside cried the goatmoth  nothing can be smoother and neater than it was I  polished it up to the highest degree and then took a  long nap in it during the winter lying as snugly in my  wooden cocoon as any bee in her waxen cell  Knowabit who till now had been silent though  looking as he always did very wise grave and atten  tive here put in a word I may be mistaken he  observed but I think that our clever friend here the  lady Goatmoth has been mentioned in ancient books  and that her larva is the famous Cossus or treegrub  that was well known to the Romans  The antennae of the goatmoth quivered with pride  and she looked as conceited and saucy as a moth could  possibly look Her deeds were then recorded in books   and by Romans She knew not what Romans might  be but supposed that they were probably some race of  gigantic men ad fairies never publish any kind of  works and though some insects eat books none have  ever yet been known to write any  And what did the Romans say of my distinguished  ancestors asked the goatmoth proudly   They said that they were good eating replied  Knowabit  Fairy Frisket polite as she was could hardly refrain  from laughing as the poor goatmoth dropped her wings  in sudden mortification at an answer so unexpected It  seemed no great honour or pleasure to be eaten by  Romans whatever they might be  Knowabit to comfort the poor insect to whose  pride he had given so sudden a fall observed   The larva of the goatmoth is I know very remark  able for its prodigious strength which allowing for the  vast difference between their sizes is far greater than  that of the most powerful man Members of the human  race often pride themselves on their strength of body  they each possess about five hundred and twentynine  muscles or organs of motion by which they turn them  selves lift burdens bend rise walk and work do what  soever ihey will But you  Madam Moth in your larva  state were possessed of more  than four thousand muscles  and could by means of V X VF  them if I mistake not raise f U W  with ease a weight more  than ten times greater than  your own  That is wonderful  exclaimed butterfly Sydney  It would puzzle one to find  a man who could easily carry on his back ten other men  as heavy as himself   Were it not taking up too much of the time of this  honourable assembly cried the goatmoth I should  like to prove to them how great was my strength by  relating an adventure which befell me this very year  when I had the misfortune to fall into the hands of  cruel man  Is it possible that after falling into the hands of  man you should live to tell of your adventure ex  claimed Fairy Frisket   No thanks to him said the goatmoth I owed  my escape not to mans mercy but to that prodigious  Strength to which the honourable and learned fairy  on your right hand did me the honour just now to  allude   Let us hear the story of a caterpillar s adventures  madam said Knowabit and though as it seemed to  Sydney some of the butterflies shook their wings im  patiently being more eager to tell their own stories  than to listen to that of the goatmoth no one ven  tured to object and the stout sturdy insect thus told  her tale  CHAPTER XVI  ADVENTURES OF A CATERPILLAR  W WILL not long detain you I see that some of my  hearers are a little impatient with an account  of my tunnelling and boring in my favourite old  willowtree One day last spring as I was  making my way through a bit of the timber  particularly tough and hard I was startled by a horrible  noise and a sudden shock which sent such a thrill through  my frame as I could never forget were I to live as I  know that I shall not for three more summers and win  ters A very little time passed and then again came  that terrible sound the whole tree seemed to quiver and  shake and then suddenly the daylight the unwelcome  daylight which I shun flashed upon me Some being  of the human race was cutting down with a bright sharp  instrument a branch from the tree in which I was  dwelling  It was the first time that I had ever seen a man and  certainly he looked to me a horrible monster while he  seemed to think not much better of me   Heres an ugly grub he observed thats eating  its way right into the wood I wonder now what they  call it Ill take it home and keep it My boy is coming  from London tomorrow and hes curious about all these  strange kinds of creatures maybe hell like to examine  this one Ill put it by in the little drawer of my  table  So the man carried me home I think that I can feel  now the pressure of his horrid hard rough fingers Hap  pily for me my captor had not far to go for the willow  grew hard by his home and he wanted to keep not  to kill me I was soon shut up in darkness quite  securely as he supposed in his dealwood drawer   Ha ha laughed I to myself heres a fine wide  tunnel that man has bored and very neatly he has done  it Theres plenty of room for me to turn myself here  But if that blundering fellow thinks that he can keep  the freebom caterpillar of a goatmoth his prisoner here  hell find he is very much mistaken  So feeling quite at home at that kind of labour I set  to work with my good strong jaws at the side of the  drawer in which I was confined The wood was harder  than that of my willow but what cared I for that  My muscles were strong my spirit was bold before  night was over I had gnawed my way right through the  side of the drawer and when the daylight dawned I was  crawling down what the man had called a table I might  have thought it the stem of a sapling tree but that it  had neither sap within it nor bark upon it  It now appeared to me that all my worst troubles  were yet to come I suppose that I was in one of mans  dwellings I dont know whether he calls it a cocoon  but if a cocoon it be it is one of prodigious size and it  puzzled even the grub of a goatmoth to know how to  make her way out of it  As I was wondering in which direction I should turn  to my horror in came my human enemy and almost put  his foot upon me as I was crawling over the floor   Why if that caterpillar has not eaten its way out  he exclaimed What jaws the ugly creature must  have But Ill put it into a tumbler it cant bite  through glass Ill be bound  Again he took up his unlucky prisoner and writhe  and twist as I might I could not escape from those  dreaded fingers which held me so firmly I was dropped  into a bright kind of cocoon that looked as if made of  pure water for I was able to see right through it it did  not shade me at all from the daylight as my dear old  willow had done But this was by no means the worst  of it This tumbler was a hundred times harder than  any wood that I ever had met with In vain I tried to  bite the smooth slippery surface the man had spoken  txo truly not even the grub of a goatmoth could make  its way through what he had called glass  Im a lost caterpillar sighed I as I lay at the  bottom of the tumbler quite worn out with my fruitless  efforts But I did not lie long inactive in my prison   Up and be doing never despair is the motto of the  goatmoth larva I am not only strong to bite I said  to myself I am also clever to spin I can not only  bore a tunnel through wood I can make a ladder of silk  Gaining new vigour and courage from hope I instantly  set to work I found to my joy that though my jaws  could make no mark upon glass yet that my gummy  silk would stick to its surface Bravely I went on with  my labour and before very long my strong wedgeshaped  head was peeping over the edge of the tumbler   How shall I descend now thought I I must let  myself down as I helped myself up by a silken ladder  I might have saved myself the trouble of thinking for  the man my tormentor at that moment caught sight  of his active prisoner   Why if this lively caterpillar isnt making its es  cape again he exclaimed The creature seems re  solved to get off one way or another but Im more than  a match for a giub though I never saw the like of this  one  So saying my tormentor knocked me down again to  the bottom of my glass cocoon or prison and then  suddenly turned it over giving me another tumble in  the tumbler on the hard surface of what I heard the  man call a plate The hard sUppery shining glass  now shut me in above as well as all around so that  there could be no possible use in climbing Below me  was the plate just as hard as the glass so that there  was not any weak point which I could attack with my  jaws   Now 111 put a good heavy book on the tumbler to  keep it down said the man and my ugly grub will  be kept as secure as if locked up in an iron safe while I  go to meet my boy at the railwaystation  I layrery still in my shining prison till the man had  quitted the place Notwithstanding my fatigue my dis  appointments and my bruises neither my courage nor  my strength had failed me yet As soon as I felt sure  of not being observed I crept round the edge of the glass  trying to find any place where it did not quite touch the  plate so that I might see some opening be it ever so  small into which I might squeeze my hard wedgeshaped  head Happily for me just in one part there was either  a trifling sinking in the plate or a trifling rise in the  glass for the two did not exactly fit the one to the  other and air from without came through Here was  an opportunity not to be lost by the grub of a goat  moth Now were my four thousand muscles to be  brought into play The glass was moderately heavy  the book was tremendously heavy but I was strong  bold and determined and I knew that my liberty if  not my life depended upon the success of the eflTort  which I was making  A fearful effort it was With my head I lifted glass  and book a little then a little more never surely before  had caterpillar attempted so difficult a feat My whole  head was squeezed under my prison at last and where  the head can manage to go the whole body can generally  manage to follow Ha ha I laugh whenever I re  member that day to think how the huge man must have  looked when he came back with his boy to find the glass  tumbler empty with the big book resting upoHn it and  the caterpillar nowhere to be seen  I was pretty well knocked up by the time that I had  drawn my whole length through and I stopped to curl  myself up and rest for a little but I dared not rest long  for I had a great deal of ground to crawl over and I  feared that the man would return before I could hide my  self out of his sight Luckily for me he had left the door  of his great cocoon open for what with gnawing and  spinning and climbing and pushing and lifting and  crawling what seemed to be a terribly long way I had  no strength left as you may believe for any more boring  through wood Much as I dislike the daylight I was  glad enough to find myself once more in the free open  air and not far from my own willowtree How I man  aged to reach it I scarcely can think I would have  given anything then for the wings with which I fly now  that the caterpillar has been changed into the moth  But were I now to fall again into the hands of barbar  ous man as I heartily hope that I never may do I could  not now gnaw my way through the drawer I could not  now spin my ladder of silk I could not now lift both  tumbler and book I could but beat my wings against  the glass in helpless despair Yes I could no longer  perform these feats of strength and of skill which must  have filled the mind of man himself with admiration and  amazement  CHAPTER XVII  BORERS WEAVERS AND LEAFROLLERS  HEN the goatmoth had finished her tale there  was a great clapping not of course of hands  but of wings and then a few seconds of silence  There was not another member of the Lepi  doptera race present that could boast of such  feats of strength and the goatmoth looked proudly  around her as if certain that uo rival would dare to con  tend with her for the prize of the fairy  A very small moth called the wolfmoth had the  courage however to come forward into the middle of the  circle formed by the winged tribes around the floweiy  throne While the most splendid butterflies kept modest  silence the wolfmoth thus addressed Fairy Frisket   If your prize lady fairy said she were ofifered to  the largest and strongest of our race I should certainly  not have taken the trouble to come here to try to win it  I cannot lift up a prison on my head and as for the  number of my muscles I do not believe that the sharpest  eyed mortal would ever attempt to count them But  the prize is offered to the member of the Lepidoptera  race that has shown most skill in making her home  Now if Mrs Goatmoth is a great borer I am a great  borer also if she digs her way into old willowtrees I  make mine through hard deal planks If I am not so  big and so strong as she is my work is all the more  curious   Oh as for boring were all famous for that ex  claimed a whole host of clearwing moths of which some  looked to the eye of Sydney like wasps and some like  gnats though they were neither so that he wondered  to see them at all amongst the Lepidoptera   And so am I so am I cried the pretty leopard  moth waving her feathery antennae and her white wings  delicately speckled with black Look at the squires  fruittrees Ask his gardener what enemy he fears to  find in the wood of his apple walnut and pear trees  We all know how to tunnel and bore and make our  selves snug beneath the rough bark which covers us in  like a wall  It seemed to butterfly Sydney that the smaller the  winged creature might be the more ready it appeared to  answer for itself for a tiny erminemoth was the next to  flutter into the circle  Really it seems to me she said pertly as if all  these ladies clearwmg goat  moth and the re«t thought that  there is nothing in the wnrld to  be hiiie but to lore and that to make  holes in live tiees or dead wood hi the  unly woik worthy nf a grub I like tcj  labour in thu light where men can see  me and not to laliour all by myRelfj but  in the society uf hundreds ol companions  We are workers nut in wood but in silk  we vseave thick webs anjnnd lioth trunk  Hand branches of tiees   I have chanced to hear at the Hall  innineniuth observed Fairy Knowabit   that yinn ract have devoured every leaf  nfT some of the hawthorns in the parks and  sijnares of London till the unfortunate  trees were in June as bare as they would be in De  cember  Pray do not address me as erminemoth our race are  accustomed to town life and town manners said the  tiny creature and there we are known by the name of  Iponymeuta Padella And pray let us not be reproached  with eating up the leaves of the May trees Many  mouths make light work The leaves grow again on the  boughs which we have stripped when we take our chry  salis nap and while other trees look dusty and black  with the smoke of London those on which we have  feasted burst out into foliage to enjoy a second spring  Few of the winged tribes have their work so much  noticed by men as ours The whole stem of a May tree  will sometimes be entirely swathed in a robe of grayish  silk in which thousands of the spinning and weaving  Iponymeuta Padella make their abode Man would will  ingly drive us out or smoke us out but ha ha ha our  numbers baffle his powers he may slay the largest  fiercest beasts in creation he may force the horse and  the ox to serve him and do his bidding but the tiny  Iponymeuta Padella keeps her own hawthorntree in the  very midst oi mans greatest city in spite of all his ill  wilL   I hope that I may be allowed to speak for just a  few moments said the pretty little oakmoth as with a  timid air she came forward My work and that of my  sisters does not show  the strength of jaw  possessed by the  borers nor perhaps  the amount of labour  I displayed by the spin  ners of the Lepidop  tera race yet may it  be thought not unwor  thy of the attention  of this great assembly  My friend the choco  late coloured lilac moth  yonder has asked me to  Bjjak for her as well as for  myself as we leafrollers are a  shy modest race not at all accus  tomed to come forward on grand  occasions like this We make  our homes in the leaves of the  Tarious trees after which we are named  rolling these leaves into tents and fasten  ing them together into whatever shape  ijxay Vjest suit us by thread of silk which  we spin The advantage which we find  in this way of housing ourselves is this  our leaf supplies us at once with board  and lodging we live on the leaf while we live in the  leaf we can never know want for we eat the house  which we dwell in Then shyly begging the pardon  of the fairy and all the butterflies and moths for having  detained them so long the oakmoth spread her delicate  leafygreen wings and flew back to the side of her choco  latecoloured friend the moth that rolls up the leaves of  the lilac   Let none despise the art of leafrolling cried the  splendid red admiral butterfly or as the learned call her  the Vanessa Atalanta I and my friend here the  painted lady both choose the same way of foiming a home  for ourselves I have a fancy for nettles and she for the  leaf of the thistle The sting of the nettle alarms not my  bold caterpillar though the human race seem to dread it  and the tough spik thistleleaf yields to the strength of  the ladys powerful larva who bends it at her good plea  sure to form the wall of her dwelling  CHAPTER XVIII  THE LIFE OP A BUTTERFLY  YDNEY had listened with such curiosity and  interest to the accounts given by various in  sects of their way of forming their dwellings  that he had excited the attention of a beautiful  peacockbutterfly that chanced to be near him  If butterflies appear lovely even to the human eye  that cannot distinguish the plumage on their wings from  dust how exquisite did they seem to the microscopic  sight of Sydney As he looked on the wing of the  peacockbutterfly beside him he beheld it covered with  tens of thousands of the most delicate scales one over  lapping another arranged in regular rows and tinted  with the loveliest hues Never had he beheld any  work of human art to be compared for finished beauty  with that bright butterflys wing Perhaps the peacock  was pleased with his look of silent admiration for she  turned to address the stranger   One would fancy she observed that all these  things were new to you yet you would be as dull as a  chrysalis if you did not know already all about boring  spinning and leafrolling  I am afraid that you will think me veiy stupid  indeed lady Peacock returned butterfly Sydney   but I really am not quite sure what a chrysalis is  If an insect could look astonished the butterfly cer  tainly did so as much amazed as you dear reader might  feel if a companion confessed to you that he was not  quite sure what kind of a creature a boy could be The  peacock however only observed It is singular that  you should not know the changes in your own condition  I see that you are a purple emperor one of the noblest  of oui race that soars aloft at noontide above the loftiest  trees so high that it is almost lost to view Perhaps  these bold flights into upper air may have some injurious  eflFeet upon memory I who am of a less aspiring  nature have a clear recollection of all that has ever  happened to me in my changeful life except of course  during my chrysalis slumber I can recall the time  when I was a black caterpillar dotted with white and  armed with long black spines feeding with numbers of  my companions on the leaves of the common nettle   Oh I must have seen you exclaimed Sydney  Pierce who remembered a repulsivelooking caterpillar  just answering to this description a creature from which  he had turned in disgust But who would ever have  thought that that ugly caterpillar I beg your pardon  he cried interrupting himself for he felt that he had  just said something very rude that that black cater  pillar could ever have turned into a butterfly so exceed  ingly lovely  One cannot always judge of  butterfly by caterpillar observed  the peacock goodhumouredly  Seeing the beautiful butterfly so  willing to enter into conversation  Sydney was inclined to ask a few  questions but expressed a fear that  he was preventing her from listen  ing to the speech which the red  admiral at that moment was making   Oh it matters not replied  lady Peacock I know all that  my companion can say her home  like my own when we were caterpillars was amongst  the leaves of the nettle She used to pull those leaves  together and fasten them as well as she might I re  member that she was then of grayishgreen colour with  a yellowish line down each side and her chrysalis was  brownish above and graygreen below and was adorned  with fine golden spots We are connected with each  other the red admiral is called Vanessa Atalanta and I  am Vanessa lo   Very pretty names remarked Sydney but not  very easy to be remembered   It strikes me that your memory is remarkably  weak observed the peacockbutterfly I see that  your wings purple emperor have been cruelly bruised  perhaps the same accident that injured them has dulled  your wit as well as your plumage You are the first  purple emperor with whom I have ever conversed pray  where did you live when you were a caterpillar   I never was a caterpillar in my life exclaimed  Sydney who would have burst out into a roar of  laughter had it been possible for a butterfly to do so  The peacock looked at him in amazement thinking  him doubtless a butterfly out of his wits Where did  you hang when you were a chrysalis she asked with  a little impatience   I dont even know for certain what a chrysalis is  replied Sydney who though ashamed of his ignorance  was in his butterfly form as frank and truthful as he  had been in that of a boy  The peacock jerked her bright wings upwards in  astonishment Sydney fancied that the eyes upon them  flashed brighter in scorn   I wish said the poor purple emperor that you  would tell me what yoit remember instead of asking me  what remember Only I may be preventing your  making your speech and winning the prize from the  fairy   I am not going to make any speech at all said the  peacock There is nothing wonderful about my work  and even if there were I should not care to have my  wings tipped with gold  They are splendid enough already thought Sydney   no fairy touch could improve them   So continued Vanessa lo if you like to listen to  a very simple tale I will tell 3ou what I recollect  though mine is but the common experience of butterflies  I have not like the goatmoth or as we should call her  the Cossus Ligniperda any curious adventures to relate   I should like to hear all that you can tell me of  your childhood I mean your caterpillarhood replied  Sydney who hoped that the power of the fancypoma  tum might last until he had heard from a butterfly her  own account of her early life and education   My first recollection said Vanessa lo is of break  ing my eggshell and finding myself with a number of  little black companions safely cradled in the fold of a  nettleleaf I need hardly say that we quickly set  about eating that being the principal occupation of  every caterpillar I sometimes wonder now at my loss  of appetite a little sip of honey from a fiower is all  that I care for When I was a caterpillar I would eat  up ten times my own weight in a very short time   It is a happy thing observed Sydney that  human beings are not so hungry in proportion to their  size   We were troubled with no cares continued the  peacock Each of us being furnished with sharp little  bristles the very birds would scarcely have wished to  touch us and there being so many of us together our  lives were very sociable and pleasant To our minds  there was no plant on the face of the earth to be com  pared to a nettle We grew fast our race do grow  very fast fourlegged and twolegged creatures do not  increase in size and weight as we do or a kitten would  grow into a cat bigger than the largest waggon that ever  moved along the highroad with whiskers as long as  cornstalks I I never remember being frightened but  once and that was when a donkey came browsing by  the side of the highroad and cropped off a thistle that  was growing quite close to our leafy retreat The only  trouble which I knew at this period of my life was that  of changing my skin   Changing your skin I exclaimed Sydney   Of course I changed it said the butterfly surpiised  at her companions look of wonder Its the most  natiu thing in the world to get out of ones skin   I cant say that I think so observed Sydney   Why I thought that all creatures did so said the  peacock whose knowledge was of course of a very  limited kind Snakes do so as well as caterpillars I  am not quite sure about donkeys and horses but human  beings certainly change their skins   I never heard that before exclaimed Sydney his  wings shaking with mirth   Ive seen a man changing his skin IVe seen it  with my own eyes said Vanessa lo in a very positive  manner for she was rather provoked at the doubt ex  pressed by what she considered to be the most stupid  butterfly in existence A man came close up to the  hedge under which our nettleplant grew and he pulled  oflF the skin from all the upper part of his body ina  twinkling He seemed to have no trouble such as we  have Instead of feeling languid and sickly as we do  as soon as he had thrown off the skin he set to work at  clipping the hedge with the greatest activity and vigour   It was not his skin but his jacket that the man  pulled off cried Sydney extremely diverted at Vanessa  los mistake   I dont know what you mean by a jacket replied  the butterfly rather offended It was an old brown  skin and the new skin under it was whitish with a  brown line on each side The oddest part of the busi  ness was that when the man had done clipping the  hedge he came stooped down picked up his old skin  and put it upon his body again A caterpillar would  have scorned to do such a thing   Caterpillars dont wear jackets murmured Sydney  to himself thinking what strange ridiculous mistakes  may be made both by butterflies and human beings if  they judge of the habits and ways of others only by  their own   When I and my companions had reached our fall  size said Vanessa lo continuing her accoimt we felt  that we had something to do besides eating and so  we began to spin fastening coarse silken threads to the  nettleleaves which we lived in This was of course to  prepare a quiet restingplace in which we might remain  during our chrysalis state I have but a dim recollec  tion of what came over me after I had  finished ray spinning I experienced a  kind of dulness and deadness and then  went to sleep at my ease How long I  remained in this state I know not I  have heard that my colour was green  with golden tints upon it and that I  hung suspended by my tail but all that  I myself can remember is the delight  which I felt this morning when I burst  into new and glorious life 1 No more a  prisoner to earth I soared aloft in the air my home  no longer a nettle my motion no longer wiiggling or  crawling the creeping thing had been given wings  the black spiny caterpillar had become   Dear me 1 exclaimed Sydney awaking suddenly  from his slumber under the tree and rubbing his eyes   here am I down again upon the earth not a butterfly  but a boy It almost seems to me as if I had come  down to a caterpillar state as I cannot rise one yard  from the ground I wish that I could have heard the  end of Madam Peacocks story Im afraid that she will  set down purple emperors as the most uncivil as well as  the most stupid of butterflies Well I have at least  learned one good lesson Not to despise or to dislike  the most common and most ugly of creatures since the  black spiked and spotted caterpillar of the nettle turns  into the glorious peacockbutterfly  CHAPTER XIX  A FRIEND IN NEED  E will now return to Philibert Philimore whom  we left on the lawn in pain and out of temper  ready to quarrel with all the world because  discontented with himself No sooner had  he by his insolence driven Sydney Pierce from  his side than Philibert bitterly repented of his folly  It was not only that he felt dull and dreary when thus  left all alone but that as soon as his pain had lulled and  his passion had time to cool Philibert began to consider  that he had been imkind and unjust and ungrateful too  in his conduct towards Sydney Young Philibert re  membered how aflFectionate and good his companion had  been to him during the preceding day how ready  Sydney had shown himself to give up his own pleasure  his own will how thoughtful he had been of the comfort  of the boy who had now requited his kindness with in  sult Before the visit of Sydney to Fairydell Hall Phili  bert had thought little about anything but what con  cerned his own enjoyment he had been a thoroughly  selfish boy But the constant example of one who con  sidered others and found his pleasure in giving pleasure  had not been without its efiect on the mind of the squires  spoiled son Philibert had learned to believe though he  acted as if he did not remember that   To live for self is to live for sorrow  The wellspent day brings the happy morrow  and he could not now do what was very wrong without  feeling uneasy afterwards  Philibert was now exceedingly lonely and sad Sydney  had gone into the woods and Philibert knew that it  would be no easy matter to find him there and even if  he should find him young Philimore felt that unless he  should ask his companions pardon it could hardly be ex  pected that what had passed would be forgiven and for  gotten  A nobleminded and generoushearted boy in Philiberts  position would have determined to do the wise and right  thing at once by all means in his power show his regret  for his conduct and try as far as he could to make  amends to his friend But Philibert though beginning  to see what was the course of duty had not brave re  solution to follow it He was vexed with himself he  was imhappy he felt not only that he was in trouble  but that he had deserved to be so yet instead of making a  struggle to get out of it agaiu the spoiled boy only sat  down upon a seat at the edge of the lawn and burst into  tears   Why Philibert my little friend what is the matter  said a sweet gentle voice as some one approached him  walking over the closelymown grass Philibert had no  need to look up through his teardimmed eyes to know  who was speaking to him for no one but Angela May  the vicars daughter ever spoke in so loving a tone to  the squires motherless boy If the selfish heart of  Philibert really cared much for any one in the world but  himself it was for her who had more than once soothed  his childish sorrows by speaking to him holy words of  counsel such as he had seldom lieard fiom any lips but  her own  Philibert made no answer to the question of the lady  so Angela came and sat down by his side Taking his little  fat hand in her own and speaking as a kind elder sister  might speak she asked him the cause of his sorrow   Sydney has gone away half sobbed the unhappy  boy   What I back to his home inquired the young lady   No yonder into the wood   Is that all We soon shall find him said Angela  cheerfully Shall you and I go exploring together   I dont want to find him I wont go after him  muttered sulky Philibert  What 1 has Sydney treated you unkindly asked  Angela  Philibert with all his faults was too honourable a  child to say Yes though his pride would not let him  honestly answer No As a kind of halfmeasure he  replied He didnt want me to kill the butterfly that  was no business of his I   And why should you kill it said Angela softly  pressing the hand which she held O dear Philibert  there is so much sorrow and pain in this world that I  could not bear to inflict one needless pang upon one of  180 A FRIEND IN NEED  Gods creatures Let them be happy while they may  and make me glad by seeing them happy Do you not  remember the beautiful promise in the Bible Blessed are  ike merciful for they shall obtain mercy V   I am sorry that I killed the butterfly said Phili  bert in a very low tone   If you tell Sydney that you are sorry why should  not you and he be happy together again   Hes angry with me I jeered him I called him  a bad name I said that I didnt care for his mother  murmured Philibert   Then you will go and frankly ask his forgiveness  said Angela   No I wont I wont ask Sydneys forgiveness  cried Philibert flushing with pride and drawing his hand  away from the gentle clasp of Angelas The squires  son was silly enough to fancy himself above Sydney  Pierce because his own father happened to be much richer  than his companions widowed mother To ask forgive  ness is always humbling to pride and Philibert shrank  from doing so  Dear PhiUbert said his friend I think that I  know something of what is passing in your heart now  for I too have a heart in which wrong thoughts and  proud feelings will often arise and they have given me  more trouble than anything else in the world  Philibert looked up with surprise into the gentle face  of the lady He knew that every one acquainted with  her character spoke of the goodness of the vicar s daugh  ter and he had heard it observed that she was rightly  called ADgela for that she had the temper of an angel  Philibert could hardly believe that she had ever been  troubled by pride or illhumour but when he looked into  her honest blue eyes he could see that she had spoken in  earnest  Yes Philibert I have to pray earnestly to God  to help me to conquer myself my unruly passions  my rebellious will and I have to keep a very close  watch indeed over the enemies within lest they take  me unawares and get the victory over me There is  one thing which I have made a rule always to do  though like yourself I have often felt very unwilling  to do it   And what is that asked Philibert who still could  hardly believe that Angela so good so gentle so kind as  she was could ever really have an inward struggle such  as she spoke of   Whenever I have spoken an unkind or hasty word  I first ask forgiveness of God for we must never forget  that to sin is to displease our Heavenly Father and then  I make it my rule to ask pardon openly of the person  whoever he or she may be whom my word may have  offended   Not if she were a servant said Philibert   If a servant if a schoolchild if a beggar replied  Angela May   I dont believe that you have often to ask pardon at  all said the boy  Not very often of my fellowcreatures answered  the vicars daughter at least not very often since I  was a very young girl The knowledge that my con  science would have no peace that I could not rest till I  had made what amends I could for hasty speaking has  had a wonderful effect in helping me to curb my tongue  and control a temper naturally hasty Now dear Phili  bert let me advise you as a friend to adopt this little  rule of mine When you are convinced that you have  been ungenerous unkind or unjust to any one take the  very first opportunity of frankly asking forgiveness  Philibert looked uneasy and grave I dont think  that I need say anything to Sydney this time he ob  served speaking slowly and after a pause He is such  a goodnatured fellow that I daresay when we meet hell  go on just as if nothing had happened After all it  does not much matter to him whether I say that Im  sorry or not   But it does matter to you dear Philibert and again  the soft hand of Angela rested upon that of the boy   You have owned to me that you have done wrong and  never can true peace be yours till you have made what  amends it is in your power to make Seeing that  Philibert looked undecided the young lady went on   I am reminded of a little incident which happened to  myself when I was a child not so old as you are now  I lost my way in your woods into which I had wandered  to look for nuts I became frightened and anxious for  I knew not in what direction to turn The more I tried  to get out of the thicket the fiirther and further I seemed  to wander into it The ground was moist with recent  rain and the print of my little shoes could be seen on  many parts of the path by which I had come I often  thought of retracing my steps but I was very unwilling  to do so for I knew that I should have many brambles  to repass and I hoped to make some short cut and get  to the edge of the wood by some nearer and pleasanter  way But all my hopes were vain I grew sadly weary  and disheartened the shadows were falling around me  and though I had called out till my voice was hoarse no  one had come to my help I must go back on my  steps after all thought I resolving to do at last what I  ought to have done as soon as I had found that I had  lost my way But I had made up my mind to take the  right course too late I could but track my footsteps  for a few yards before it became too dark for me to see  the prints After trying and failing I sat down in de  spair and cried as if my heart were breaking Darker  and darker grew the night more piercingly chilly the  air and I became very faint with hunger terror and cold  If my friends had not come with torches to seek for  their little lost child in the wood I do not suppose that  I should have lived to see the dawn of the morning  Philibert had listened with interest to Angelas ac  count of her childish adventure not uttering a word  until she had ended it He then observed I like your  story but I dont see that it has anything to do with my  asking Sydneys forgiveness   I have often thought of that evening in the woods  dear boy when having wandered from what I felt to be  the straight way of duty I have found myself in any  doubt as to how I should return to it I seem to hear a  voice in my heart there is such a voice in yours dear  Philibert saying Retrace your steps at once do not  wait till it be too late to do so Especially in this mat  ter of asking forgiveness let us try no roundabout way  Let us never be content with a hope that through the  generous forbearance of one whom we Jiave offended  things will go on again as if nothing had happened Let  us force ourselves however our pride may rebel to own  that we have done wrong The pain of such a confession  is soon over we have probably regained a friend we  have certainly done what is pleasing in the sight of our  Heavenly Father and are likely to enjoy once more that  holy peace of mind which can never be ours while we  have one unrepented sin   Angela I will I will ask Sydney to forgive me I  cned Pliilibert rising from his seat I wish I had  you always with me to tell me what is right I have not  a mother as Sydney Pierce has or pwhaps I should be  more like him  These were lowly words to fall from the lips of the  squires spoiled boy they gladdened the heart of Angela  May and rising she gave Philibert a kiss as loving as  might have been pressed on his cheek by his own mother  had she been living Perhaps it was the pressure of  Angelas hand upon Philibert s shoulder that made his  little collar fall off upon the grass The young lady  stooped and picked it up   I thought observed Angela as she gave it to Phili  bert that your collar was fastened with a little pearl  brooch   Oh yes I hope it is safe exclaimed Philibert in  a tone of alarm  I can see no brooch replied Miss May bending  down and looking to the right and to the left Philibert  fell on his knees to search the grass had been so closely  mown that had the brooch been there he must have  seen it almost directly  Angela examined the boys dress to see if the brooch  had by any chance dropped under the velvet Philibert  shook himself violently in the faint hope that the jewel  might drop out of some fold AH was in vain and the  little boy looked ready again to burst into tears   Oh papa will be bo vexed so dreadfully vexed  exclaimed Philibert He gave me that brooch on my  last birthday as such a very great present for it had been  mammas before she married Papa made me promise  that I would take such care of it and never part with  it all my life long and now IVe lost it Ive lost it  Philibert shook himself violently again but rather from  vexation than from any hope of shaking out the brooch   We must search for it well never despair of finding  it Where have you last been inquired Angela May  In the woods yonder replied Philibert we were  hunting for an antlion We could not find that and Im  afraid that we shall never find such a very little thing  as my pearlbrooch neither   We will try at least to do so said Angela come  and I will help you to search How glad we shall be if  we discover it at last And taking hold of Philiberts  hand the young lady went with him to the wood look  ing carefully about her from side to side as her compan  ion retraced as far as he could remember them the steps  by which he had come  For more than an hour Philibert and Angela thus  searched for the brooch the young lady trying to cheer  and encourage the boy who grew sadly tired and dis  heartened and who but for her would have soon given  up in despair all attempt to find his lost treasure It  was exceedingly inconvenient to Angela to give up so  much of her time She had come to see the gardener of  Fairydell Hall to procure from him some cuttings of rare  plants which the squire had offered to give her and had  intended to hasten back as quickly as she could to wel  come a dear friend from London whom she had not seen  for years and for whom she was procuring the cuttings  But Angela impatient as she felf to return home did  not even let Philibert see that she was in a hurry She  seemed to have nothing to think of but how to comfort  and help the poor little boy This was indeed the piin  cipal reason why Angelas gentle words of advice were  seldom without effect the vicars daughter practised  herself what she preached her counsels and her example  went ever together While Angela was helping Philibert  to search for the jewel that his father might not be dis  pleased by its loss she found an opportunity of dropping  in a few words about that priceless pearl peace of con  science that gift so far more precious than all the gems  to be found in the land or the sea  CHAPTER XX   THE FAIRY 8 MISTAKE  JHE fairys prize had been given her feast of  honeydew had been enjoyed the meeting of  butterflies was over The last bright winged  member of the Lepidoptera had fluttered away  from Violet Dell even the rosebeetle had crept away  from his station at the feet of the fairy But Frisket  still sat on her flowerj throne her goldentipped wand  drooping from the tiny hand which held it The blossoms  in her wreath were beginning to fade but the fairy did  not seem to be inclined to spring up on her glassy wings  to seek for fresher and brighter  It can scarcely be that you are weary my sweet  sister fay said Knowabit who was still by her side   still less can it be that you are sad yet were you a  mortal fair instead of a fairy I might think that you  now were both sad and weary Has the meeting of  butterflies and moths been less well attended than you  had expected It seemed to me after my long seclusion  amongst books as if to a bed of flowers the power of  motion had been given petals being changed into wings  and stamen into antennae till all the air was alive with  beauty Or were you mortified at having to bestow  your prize upon an insect that you favoured less than  the rest   I should certainly have preferred tipping the wings  of the peacockbutterfly with gold replied Fairy Frisket  but I was not at the moment when you addressed  me thinking either of butterflies or moths They give  me no cause for vexation or displeasure Each has her  own place in the world her leaf to roll or her cocoon  to spin she lives works and dies exactly as she was  intended by nature to do I was thinking and I  own thinking sadly of human beings and especially   here there was indignation in the tone of the little  fairy of that wretched selfish creature Philibeit  Philimore   I do not see why my fair sister should trouble her  self especially about him said Knowabit blandly  I cannot endure to see a creature endowed with mind  and all kinds of powers that might make him so grand  and so noble leading such a caterpillar life exclaimed  Frisket springing to her feet and looking as angry as a  pretty little fairy could look as she struck the ground  with her wand Yes I repeat it a caterpillais life  and worse than that for he has not even taken to spin  ning or leafrolling 1 Philibert seems to care for nothing  but eating drinking and amusing himself He is ready  indeed to sting and annoy some caterpillars can do that  also he wantonly killed my purple emperor he insulted  his kind companion he is not only like a creeping  creature but a blackspotted spiny caterpillar in spite  of his blue velvet dress   My dear sister fay said quiet Knowabit smiling  at her angry impatience it is the blackspotted spiny  caterpillar that turns into the Vanessa lo the bright  peacockbutterfly at last   The selfish caterpillar of a boy will never turn into  anything but a selfish caterpillar of a man 1 exclaimed  Fairy Frisket I have done all that I could to rouse  and improve him it is no fault of mine if Philibert re  main the contemptible creature which he is Ive hit  him over the ear over the hand and over the nose with  my stingbrush it only made him roar and stamp Ive  speckled his face Ive stirred his food Ive  Even sober Knowabit could scarcely help bursting  out laughing at his sisters account of her fashion of im  proving a troublesome mortal That may not have  been the best way of managing a boy he observed  you tormented his skin you spoiled his dinner but you  never reached his heart  His heart repeated Frisket more slowly I doubt  whether Philibert has a heart at all and if he has I  dont know how to get at it   Hardly I fear observed Knowabit hearts seem  to be things quite out of the reach of fairies I have  never found the way to Philiberts yet though he and I  so often have met But you sister fairy have never  shown yourself at all to that boy  And never will cried Frisket with petulance at  least never till that caterpillar of a boy shows himself  able to rise a little from his nettleleaf of selfishness and  pride K he did so there is no saying whether But  he never will cried Frisket interrupting herself in the  middle of her sentence  But suppose that Philibert should rise from that  nettleleaf said her brother   Then indeed I would pull my tassel then would I  show myself to a mortal and he should meet the smile and  enjoy the favour and receive the gifts of Fairy Frisket  While this conversation between the fays was going  on in Violet Dell at another part of the wood Angela and  Philibert now thoroughly wearied with the fruitless  search for the brooch were seated on the trunk of a  fallen tree earnestly talking together  I suppose I suppose that I ought to do it said poor  Philibert with a heavy sigh but it will be harder to  confess to papa that I have lost the pearlbrooch than to  beg Sydneys pardon for my rudeness Papa will be not  only vexed but angry for he forbade me ever to wear  that brooch when I played about in the wood   You see dear boy that the good resolutions which  you have been making will be put at once to the proof  said Angela May You have a thorny bit of giound to  go over you have to conquer fear as well as to wrestle  down pride But when you lay your head down on your  pillow tonight how thankful you will be if you can re  member a painful duty performed a victory won over self  I do mean to turn over a new leaf I do mean to try  to be a different boy from what I have been said  Philibert and I will ask for help as you have told me  to ask I hope in time to think of others as you and  Sydney are always doing and be loved as you and he are  But before I go home and confess to papa that I have  lost my pearlbrooch would you mind helping me to  search for it just a little longer Oh how glad I should  be to find it Never will I disobey papa again by wear  ing it in the wood  Tired as she was and very anxious to get back to her  home Angela May would not refuse the request of her  poor young friend The two began again their weari  some search shaking fern leaves examining mosses  looking in likely and unlikely places for the jewel which  Philibert had dropped  Oh theres Sydney exclaimed Philibert suddenly   how I do hate having to ask his forgiveness  Dont delay do the right thing at once or your  resolution may fail you said Angela  Little Philiberts cheek had been pale with weariness  but now it grew red with shame as making a strong  brave eflfort to overcome his dislike to humbling himself  he ran up to his companion while Angela followed more  slowly  Sydney I beg your pardon Ive behaved very  badly I hope youll forgive me 1 gasped Philibert out  of breath less from the effect of running than from the  difficulty which he had in bringing out such a sentence  Oh dont think about that any more dear PhUibert  cried Sydney Pierce in his open frank kindly way   See heres something of yours that Ive found And  he held out the little pearlbrooch  Philibert jumped for joy at the sight he seemed to  be getting back his jewel and his peace of mind together   Oh you dear old fellow I he exclaimed grasping  the hand which Sydney held out with the brooch and  wringing that hand warmly you dont know what a  kindness you have done me I am ten times more sorry  than I was before at having treated you so badly since  you return my evil with good But Im going to try to  be a very different companion to you in ftiture Im going  to try to keep my temper and remember my duty and  forget myself like you and dear Angela May  An exclamation of astonishment burst from the lips of  the young lady who came up to the boys at that moment  an exclamation not caused by her having overheard the  last sentence of Philibert The boy who had glanced  towards her as he spoke struck by the amazement and  admiration expressed in Angelas face followed the di  rection of her eyes and uttered in a loud tone of de  light Oh what a beautiful beautiful fairy  Yes Fairy Frisket had pulled her tassel and Knowa  bit had pulled his and there they appeared in full sight  of three mortals poised on their glassy wings their gossa  mer robes glistening in the sunlight that streamed through  openings between leafy boughs the loveliest little brother  and sister that ever were seen Angela who had never  even heard of Knowabit was of course the most aston  ished of the three spectators but Philibert Philimore the  once spoiled boy was perhaps the happiest of them all as  he listened to the tinkling music of Fairy Friskets address   Philibert Philimore you have learned a lesson and  one has been taught even to a fairy I have learned that  good words may have more power than a stingbrush  kindly deeds than the wand of a fay  Not gilded rod of fairywood  But love content and gratitude  Give sweetest taste to common food  Make everything seem fair and good  Oh that every selfwilled child would try to cast off his  old evil habits as the black larva casts off his dark skin  and would rise to a higher nobler happier existence far  above the nettleleaf of selfishness as from the creep  ing crawling caterpillar springs up into glorious life the  bright winged Vanessa lo  INDEX  AmazonAnts Formica ruescdtM 49  AntLion MyrmaUon formiearitu
