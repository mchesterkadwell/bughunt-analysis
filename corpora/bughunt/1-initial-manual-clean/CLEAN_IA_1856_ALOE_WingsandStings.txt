WINGS AND STINGS  i TAIB FOB IHE YOBKO  T NELSON AND SONS LONDON EDINBURGHi  WINGS AND STINGS  CHAPTER I   Hau you not better go on a little faster with  your work Polly f said Minnie Wingfield  glancing np for a minute from her own over  which her little fingers had been busily moying  and from which she now for the first time raised  her eyes   I wish that there were no such thing as  work r exclaimed Polly from her favourite seat  by the schoolroom window through which she  had been watching the bees thronging in and out  of their hive some flying away to seek honied  treasure some returning laden with it to their  homa   I think that work makes one enjoy play  more replied Minnie her soft voice scarcely  heard amidst the confusion of sounds which  filled the schoolroom for there was a spellings  class answering questions at the moment and  the hum of voices from the boys echoolroom  which adjoined that of the girls added not a  little to the noise  The house might itself be regarded as a hive  its rosycheeked scholars as a little swarm of bees  and knowledge as the honey of which they were  in search drawn not from flowers but from the  leaves of certain dogseared books which had  few charms for the eyes of Polly Bright   I never have any play T said the little girl  peevishly As soon as school is over and I  should like a little fim there is Johnny to be  looked after and the baby to be carried I hate  the care of children mother knows that I do  and I think that baby is always crying on pur  pose to tease me 1   Yet it must be pleasant to think that you  are helping your mother and doing your duty  Polly uttered a little grunting sound which  did not seem like consent and ran her needle two  or three times into her seam always drawing it  back instead of pushing it through which every  one knows is not the way to get on with work   Why even these little bees Minnie con  tinued have a sort of duty of their own and  how steadily they set about itl   Pretty easy duty playing amongst flowers  and feasting upon honey l  « Oh but   Minnie Wingfield no talking allowed in  school cried the teacher from the top of the  room turning towards the comer near the win  dow Polly Bright you are always the last  in your class  This time the lazy fingers did draw the needle  through but a cross illtempered look was on the  face of the little girl while her companion Min  nie colouring at the reproof only worked faster  than before  We will leave them seated on their bench with  their sewing in their hands and passing through  the little window as only authors and their  readers can do cross the narrow garden with its  small rows of cabbages and onions bordered by a  line of stunted gooseberry bushes and mixing  with the busy inhabitants of the hive glide  through the tiny opening around which they  cluster and enter the palace of the bees Now  I have a suspicion that though my young readers  may be well acquainted with honeycomb and  honey and have even had hives on a bench in  their own gardens they never in their lives have  been inside one and are totally ignorant of the  language of bees For your benefit therefore I  intend to translate a Httle of the buzzing chit  chat of the winged nation and begging you to  consider yourself as little as possible conduct you  at once to the palace of Queen Farina  A very curiouB and beautiful palace it is the  OryBtal Palace itself is not more perfect in its  waj Look at the long lines of cells framed  with the nicest care row above row built of  pure white wax varnished with gum and filled  with provisions for the winter 1 Yonder are the  nurseries for the in£uit bees these larger apart  ments are for the rojal race that laigest of  all is the statechamber of the queen How  straight are the passages just wide enough to let  two travellers pass without jostling And as  for the inhabitants of this singular palace or  rather I should say this populous city though  for a moment you may think them all hurrying  and bustling about in utter confusion I assure  you that they are governed by the strictest  order each knows her own business her own  proper place I am afraid that before you are  well acquainted with your small companions you  may find some difficulty in knowing one£rom  another as each bee looks as much like her neigh  bour as a pin does to a pin I am not speaking  of course of her majesty the queen distinguished  as she is from all her subjects by the dignified  length of her figure and the shortness of her  wings but you certainly would not discover  imless I told you that the little creature hanging  from the upper comb is considered a beauty in  Beeland You must at once fancy your eyes  powerful mioroBOopefl till a daisy is enlarged to  the size of a table and the thread of a spider to  a pieoe of stout whipcord for not till then can  you find out the smallest reason why Sipsyrup  should be vain of her beauty Yet why should  she not pride herself on her slender shape or her  fine down vanity may seem absurd in a bee  but surely it is yet more so in any reasonable  creature to whom sense has been given to know  the trifling worth of mere outside looks and I  fear that I may have amongst my young readers  some no wiser than little Sipsyrup  She is not buzzing eagly about like her com  panions who are now working in various parties  some raising the white walls of the cells some  carryiQg away small cuttings of wax not to be  thrown away but used in some other place for  bees are very careful and thrifty some putting  a fine brown polish on the combs made of a gum  gathered from the buds of the wild poplar  some bringing in provisions for the little work  men who are too busy to go in search of it  themselves Ko Sipsyrup seems in her hive as  little satisfied as Polly in her sohoolioom as  she hangs quivering her wings with an im  patient movement veiy unworthy of a sensible  bee   A fine morning this buzzed an industrious  young insect making beebread with all her  might I may here remark that the subject of  the weather is much studied in hives and that  their inhabitants show a knowledge of it that  might put to shame some of the learned amongst  us I am not aware that they ever make use of  barometers but it is said that they manage sel  dom to be caught in a shower and take care to  keep at home when there is thunder   A fine morning indeed replied Sipsyrup   Yes the sunshine looks tempting enough to be  sure no doubt the flowers are all full of honey  and the hills covered with thyme but of what  use is this to a poor nursebee like me scarcely  allowed to snatch a hasty sip for myself but  obliged to look after these wretched little larvsa  that is the name given to young babybees  and carry home tasteless pollen to make bread  for them when I might be enjoying myself in  the sunshine   We once were larvae ourBelves meekly ob  served Silverwing   Yes and not very long ago replied Sip  syrup rather pertly glancing at the whitish  down that showed her own youth for it was  but three days since she had quitted her own  nimsery which may account for her being so  silly a young bee   And but for the kindness of those who sup  plied our wants when we were poor helpless  little creatures we should never have lived to  have wings continued her companion   Dont remind me of that time buzzed Sip  Bjrup who could not bear to think of herself as  a tiny feeble worm Anything more weary  and tiresome than the life that I led shut up all  alone in that horrid cell spinning my own cover  let from morning till night I am sure that I  cannot imagine Ah speaking of that spinning  if you had only seen what I did yesterday T   What was thatT inquired Silverwing   As I flew past a sunny bank facing the  south I noticed a small hole at the entrance of  which I saw one of our cousins the poppybees  Her dress you must know is different from ours  Sipsyrup always thought something of dress  it is black studded on the head and back with  reddish grey hairs and her rings are edged with  grey Wishing to notice a little more closely  her curious attire I stopped and wished her  good day Yery politely she invited me into her  parlour and I entered the hole in the bank   A dull gloomy place to live in I should  fear   DuU gloomy exclaimed Sipsyrup quiver  ing her feelers at the recollection why the cell  of our queen is a dungeon compared to it The  hole grew wider as we went farther in till it  appeared quite roomy and large and all round it  was hung with the most splendid coverings  formed of the leaves of the poppy of a dazzling  scarlet delightful to behold Since I saw it I  have been scarcely able to bear the look of this  old hive with its thousands of cells one just  like another and all of the same white hue T   Had the poppybee a queen inquired Sil  verwing   No she is queen and worker and everything  herself she has no one to command her no one  to obey no waspish companion like Stickasting  there   Whats that who buzzes about meT cried  a large thick bee hurrying towards them with  an angry hum Stickasting had been the plague  of the hive ever since she had had wings she  was especially the torment of the unfortunate  drones who not having been gifted with stings  like the workers had no means of defence to  protect them from their bullying foe When a  larva her impatient disposition was not known  she had spun her silken web like any peaceable  insect then lain quiet and asleep as a pupa or  nymph But no sooner did the young bee awake  to life than using her new powers with hearty  good will she ate her way through the web at  such a quick rate that the old bees who looked  in pronounced at once that she was likely to be  a most active worker Nor were they disap  pointed as fajr as work was conoemed no one  was ready to fly 8ter or farther no one worked  harder at building the cells but it was soon  discovered that her activity and quickness were  not the only qualities for which she was remark  able If ever bee had a bad temper that bee  was Stickasting quarrelling bulljdng attacking  fightings she was as bad as a wasp in the hive  No one would ever have trusted larvsd to her  care Sipsyrup might neglect or complain of her  charge but Stickasting would have been posi  tively cruel Her companionship was shunned  as must be expected by all of her character  whether they be boys or bees and she seldom  exchanged a hum except of defiance with any  creature in the hive  Sipsyrup the moment that ahe perceived  Stickasting coming towards her fiew off in  alarm leaving poor Silverwing to bear the brunt  of the attack   Who buzzes about me repeated Stickasting  fieroely flying vy dose up to the little nurse  DeOi   Indeed I never named you replied Silver  wing timidly shrinking back as close as she could  to the comb   If you were not talking against me yourselt  you were listening to and encouraging one who  did Who dare say that I am waspish con  tinned Stiokasthig quivering her wings with  anger till they were almost invisible It is this  gossip and slander that make the hive too hot  to hold us I once thought better of you Silver  wing as a quiet goodnatured sort of a bee but  I now see that you are just like the rest and as  silly as you are ugly  This was a very provoking speech it was  intended to be so but Silverwing was not a  creature ready to take offence whatever she felt  she returned no answer an example which I  would strongly recommend to all in her position  whether standing on six feet or on two  But Stickasting was resolved to pick a quarrel  if possible especially with one whom she con  sidered less strong than herself for she was not  one of those generous beings who scorn to take  advantage of the weakness of another Sticka  sting much resembled the class of rude coarse  minded boys who find a pleasure in teasing chil  dren and annoying little girls and like to show  their power over those who dare not oppose it   I owe you a grudge Silverwing for your  conduct to me yesterday When I was toiling  and working at the cells like a slave not having  time to go out for refreshment I saw you fly  past me two or three times and not a drop of  honey did you offer me   I was carrying pollen for my little larv  gently replied Silverwing it is not m j office  to supply the builders thougli I am sure that I  should do 80 with pleasure but the babybees  are placed under my charge and you know what  care they need till they begin to spin   YeSy idle hungry troublesome creatures that  they are Have they not set about their spin  TiiTi g yet m make them stir themselyes  and Stickasting made a movement towards the  nurserycells   The larv» do not like to be disturbed f cried  Silverwing anxious for her charges and pladng  herself between them and the intruder   Like I daresay not but who cares what  they like Get out of the way 111 prick them  up a little r   Tou shall not come near them himmied  the little nurse resolutely keeping her place   I say that I shall who shall hinder me  Gret out of my way or Ill let you feel my sting  Silverwing trembled but she did not stir ftir  she was a faithful little bee As the hen is ready  to defend her chickens from the hawk and een  the timid wren will fight for her brood so this  feeble insect would have given up her life rather  than have forsaken the little ones confided to  her care  But she was not left alone to struggle with  her assailaot two of her winged companions  oame to the rescue and Stickasting who had no  wish to encoTinter such odds and was fonder  perhaps of bullying than of fightings no sooner  saw Waxywill and Honeyball on the wing than  with an angry hum she hurried out of the hive  CHAPTER II  SOME AOOOUNT OF A WAXEBFALL  I WISH that all little nurses were as trustworthy  as Silyerwing or as kind and patient with their  charges While Polly Bright has sat in her  motherB cottage trimming her bonnet till it  looks as absurd as pink ribbons can make it the  poor baby has been crying unheeded in his cne  except that now and then when vexed more  than usual by the noise with an almost angry  look she pauses for a moment to rock the cradle  with her foot She does not notice that little  Johnny has been clambering up by the pail  which her mother has set aside for her washing  till the sudden sound of a fall and a splash and  a childs frightened cry startle her and she sees  little streams running all oyer the stone floor  and Johnny flat on his face in the middle of a  loud roar and a pool of water  Up she JTimps not in the best of tempers poor  Johnny is dragged up by one arm and receives  one or two slaps on the back which only makes  him cry louder than before he stands a picture  of childish misery with dripping dress and open  mouth the tears rolling down his rosy cheeks  helpless and frightened as his careless sister  shakes and scolds him and shakes him again for  what was the effect of her own negligence  Happily for the little boy Minnie Wingfield is  a near neighbour and comes running at the  sound of his distress   Why what is the matter my dear little  man T are her first words as she enters the cot  tage   Look here did you ever see anything like it  His dress clean on today I cannot turn my  back for a moment but he must be at the pail  naughty tiresome mischievous boy and poor  Johnny received another shake A pretty  state the cottage ia in and there Oh my  bonnet my bonnet 1 exclaimed Polly as she saw  that in her hurry and anger she had thrown it  down and that pink ribbons and all it lay on  the floor right across one of the little streams of  water   Never mind the bonnet the poor child may  be hurt and Oh take care the baby will be  wetted and without waiting for Pollys tardy  aid Minnie pushed the cradle beyond reach of  danger  While Polly was yet bemoaning her bonnet  and trying to straighten out its damaged ribbons  Minnie had found out something dry for the  shivering little boy had rubbed him and com  forted him and taken him upon her knee then  asking him to help her to quiet poor baby had  hushed the sickly infant in her arms Was  there no pleasure to her kind heart when its  wailing gradually ceased and the babe fell into  a sweet sleep or when Johnny put his plump  arms tight round her neck and pressed his little  lips to her cheek  There are some called to do great deeds for  mankind some who bestow thousands in charity  some who visit hospitals and prisons and live  and die the benefactors of their race But let  not those who have not power to perform any  thing greaiy imagine that because they can do  little they need therefore do nothing to in  crease the sum of happiness upon earth There  is a terrible amount of suffering caused by neglect  of or unkindness to little children Their lives  often how short are embittered by harshness  their tempers spoiled sometimes their health  injured and can those to whose care the helpless  little ones were confided imagine that there is no  sin in the petulant word the angry blow or that  many will not have one daj to answer for all the  sorrow which they have caused to their Lords  feeble lambs to those whose springtime of life  should be happy  Would my readers like to know a little more  of Minnie Wingfield whose look was so kind  whose words were so gentle that her presence  was like sunshine wherever she went She lived  in a little white cottage with a porch round  which twined roses and honeysuckla There was  a little narrow seat just under this porch where  Minnie loved to sit in the summer evenings with  her work or her book when her work was done  listening to the blackbird that sang in the apple  tree and the humming of the bees amidst the  blossoms Little Minnie led iw retired life but  by no means a useless one K her mothers cot  tage was the picture of neatness it was Minnie  who kept it so clean Her brothers mended  stockings his nicely washed shirts all did credit  to her neat fingers Yet she could find time to  bestow on the garden to trim the borders to watei  the plants to tie up the flowers in which her sick  mother delighted Nor did Minnie neglect the  daily school She was not clever but patient and  ever anxious to please her teacher regarded her  as one of her best scholars and pointed her out  as an example to the rest But Minnies great  enjoyment was in the Simdayschool there she  learned the lessons which made duty sweet to  her and helped her on the right way through the  week The small Bible which had been given to  her by her father with all his yourite verses  marked was a precious companion to Minnie  not studied as a taskbook or carelessly read as a  matter of custom but valued as a treasiu and  consulted as a friend and made the rule and guide  of daily life  And was not Minnie happy In one sense  she certainly was so but still she had her share  of this worlds trials The kind father whom she  had fondly loved had died the year before and  besides the loss of so dear a friend his death had  brought poverty upon his family It was a hard  struggle to make up the rent of the little cottage  which Mrs Wingfield could not bear to quit for  did not everything there remind her of her dear  husband had he not himself made the porch  and planted the flowers that adorned it Often  on a cold winters day the little fire would die  out for want of fuel and Minnie rise stiQ hun  giy from the simple meal which she had spared  that there might be enough for her parent and  her brother  Mrs Wingfields state of health was another  source of sorrow She was constantly ailing and  never felt well and though saved every trouble  by her attentive child and watched as tenderly  as a lady oould have been the aufferings of the  poor woman made her peevish and fretful and  sometimes even harsh to h gentle daughter  Tom her brother was also no small trial to  Minnia Unlike her he had little thought for  anything beyond self he neither considered tlie  eomfort nor the feelings of others if Minnie was  like sunshine in the cottage of her mother Tom  too often resembled a bleak east wind and though  Mrs Wingfield and her daughter never admitted  such a thought their home was happiest when  Tom was not in it  But it is time to return to our hive  CHAPTEB III  A FLATTKBINQ INVITATION  Waxtwxll and Honeyball had both come to the  assistance of Silverwing and she buzzed her  thanks in a grateful way to both though diES  ent motives had brought them to her aid for  they were very different bees in their dispositions  Honeyball was a goodhumoured easy kind of  creature Very ready to do a kindness if it cost  her little trouble but lazy as any drone in  the hive Honeyball would have liked to live  all day in the bell of a foxglove with nothing  to disturb her in her idle feast It was said in  the hive that more than once she had been known  to sip so much that at last she had been unable  to rise and for hours had lain helpless on the  ground Sipsyrup who like other vain silly  creatures was very fond of talking about other  peoples concerns had even whispered that  Honeyball had been seen busy at one of the pro  visioncells stored for the winters use which it  is treason in a bee to touch but as those who  talk much generally talk a little nonsense we  may hope that there was no real ground for the  story  Waxywill was one of whom such a report  would never have been believed there was not a  more honourable or temperate worker in the hive  Tet Stickasting herself was scarcely less liked  so peevish and perverse was the temper of this  bea If desired to do anything it was sure to be  the very thing which she did not fancy Were  oeUs to be built she could not bear moping in  doors if asked to bring honey she always  foimd out that her wings were tired She could  not bear submission to the laws of the hive and  once actually shook her wings at the queen  When she flew to help Silverwing it was less out  of kindness to her than the love of opposing  Stickasting and yet Waxywill was not an  imgeneroTis bee she had more sense too than  insects generally posseas she would have been  respected and even loved in the hive had not her  stubborn wilful temper spoilt alL  We will now follow Sipsyrup in her hasty  flight as leaving both her friend and her charges  behind she made her retreat from Stickasting  How delightful she found the fine fresh air after  the heated hive Now up now down she pur  sued her varying course sometimes humming for  a moment around some fragrant flower then  even before she had tasted its contents deserting  it for one yet more tempting Deeply she  plunged her long tongue into its cup her curious  pliable tongue so carefully guarded by Nature in  a nicely fitting sheath Sheath your tongue P  was an expression which the gossipping little bee  had heard more often than she liked especially  from the mouth of Waarywill It might be an  expressive proverb in other places than Beeland  for there are tongues whose words are more cut  ting than swords that much need the sheath of  discretion  The movements of the lively insect were  watched with much interest by Spinaway the  spider from her quiet home in a rosebush Sip  syrup disdaining the narrow garden of the  school had winged her way over the wall and  turning into a narrow green lane that was near  was now sporting with the blossoms by Mrs  Wingfields porch Spinaway was a clever art  ful spider somewhat ambitious too in her way  She had made her web remarkably firm and  strong and expected to be rewazded by nobler  game than the little aphis or bony knat she  had once succeeded in capturing a bluebotUe fly  and this perhaps it was that raised her hopes so  high that she did not despair of having a bee in  her larder  « Good mommft said Spinaway in a soft  coaxing tone as Sip63rrap came fluttering near  her You seem to have travelled some distance  my fHend and if you should like to rest yourself  here I am sure that you would be heartily wel  come  Sipsyrup was a young inexpeiienoed bee but  she did not much fancy the looks of the spider  with her hunchback and long hairy legs She  politely therefore declined the invitation and  continued her feast in a flower   I am roaUy glad to see a friend in a nice  quiet way continued the persevering spider   I And it very dull to sit here all the day I  would give anything to have wings like a bea  Sipsyrup who loved gossip advanced a little  nearer taking care to keep clear of the Weh   I do long to hear a little news of the world  to know what passes in your wonderful hive 1  am ourions to learn about jour queeu your  manner and style of dress is such that I am  sure that you must have been much about the  court  Settling upon a leaf still at a safe distance  Sipsyrup indulged her taste for chitchat glad to  have so attentive a listener Spinaway soon  heard aU the gossip of the hive how the present  queen had killed in single combat the queen of  another swarm whilst the bees of both nations  watched the fight and how the hostile band  when they saw their queen dead had submitted  to the conqueror at once How a slug had last  morning £rept into the hive and irightened her  out of her wits but had been put to death by  fierce Stickasting before it had crawled more  than an iQch Sipsyrup then related and  really for once her conversation was very amu  sing all the difficulties and perplexity of the  people of the hive as to how to get rid of the  body of the intruder She herself had been  aaid to venture near the monster but Silver  wing and the resl had striven with aU their  might to remove the dead slug from their hive   And did they succeed T said Spinaway much  interested   Oh I it was quite impossible to drag out the  slug We were in such distress sudi a thing  in the hive our hive always kept so neat and  28 A FLATTERING IKYITATION  dean that not a scrap of wax is left lying  about r   Wliat did yon dot said the spider it  really was a distressing affidr T   Waxy will thought of a plan for preventing  annoyance She proposed that we should coyer  the slug all over with wax so that it should  rather appear like a piece of the comb than a  dead creature left in the hive   A capital plan cried Spinaway and was  the thing done   Yes it was and before the day was over   So there Mrs Slug remains in a white wrap  ping laughed the spider a warning to those  who go where they are not wanted You were  I daresay one of the foremost in the work   Not I I would not have touched the ugly  creature with one of my feelers   I beg your pardon T said the spider   indeed I might have judged by your appearance  that nothing but the most refined and elegant  business would ever be given to you I You look  as though you had never touched anything  rougher than a rose T  Tina speech put Sipsyrup in high goodhumour  she began to think that she had judged the spider  harshly and that she really was an agreeable  creature in spite of her ugly hunch   If you speak of delicate work observed the  bee very politely I never saw anything bo fine  as your web   It is tolerably well finished said the spider  with a bow would you honour me by a closer  inspection r   Oh thank you Im not curious in these  matters replied Sipsyrup still feeling a little  doubtful of her new friend   You have doubtless remarked said Spin  away that each thread is composed of about  five thousand others all joined together   No really I had no idea of that how  wonderfully fine they must be   I am surprised that you did not see it at  least if the powers of your eyes equal their  beauty I never beheld anything like them  before their violet colour their beautiful shape  cut as it were into hundreds of divisions like  fine honeycomb cells and studded all over with  most delicate hair I would give my eight eyes  for your two   Two cried Sipsyrup mightily pleased I  have three more on the back of my head   I would give anything to see them if they  are but equal to the facetted onesno creature  in the world could boast of such a set Might I  beg would you favour me  Silly Sipsyrup foolish bee not the first how  ever nor I fear the last to be caught by sugary  words Blended by vanity forward she flew  touched the sticky clammy web entangled her  feet straggled to get free in vain in vain  quivered her wings in terrified efforts shook  the web with all her might but could not  escape Her artful foe looked eagerly on afraid  to approach until the poor bee should have  exhausted herself by her struggles Ah better  for Sipsyrup had she kept in her hive had she  spent all the day in making beebiead to feed  the little larvse in their cells  CHAPTER IV  HOME LESSONS AND HOME TRIALS  Buzz buzz buzz Theres a bee in a webP  cried Tom looking up from the bowl of porridge  which he was eating in the rosecovered porch   Poor thing said Minnie rising from her  seat   A precious fright it must be in what a  noise it makes cried her brother   It is not much entangled I think that I  could set it free and Minnie ran up to the  web   And be stung for your pains nonsense  leave it alona It is good fun to watch it in its  struggles   It never can be good fun to see any creature  in miseiy replied Minnie and with the help of  a little twig in a very short time poor SipEfyrup  was released from the web   Poor little bee said Minnie it has hurt  its wing and some of the web is still clinging to  its legs I am afraid that it cannot fly   I hope that it will sting you laughed Tom   Are you going to nurse and pet it here and  get up an hospital for sick bees   I think that it must belong to our school  mistresss hive I will carry it there and put it  by the opening and let its companions take care  of it and notwithstanding Toms scornful laugh  Minnie bore off the bee on her flnger   You are the most absurd girl that I ever  knew said he on her return What does it  matter to you what becomes of one bee I  should not mind smothering a whole hive   Ah Tom said his sister when there is so  much pain in the world I do not think that one  would willingly add ever so little to it And I  have a particular feeling about animals You  know that they were placed under man and  given to man and they were all so happy until   until man sinned now innocent as they are  they share his punishment of pain and of death  and it seems hard that we should make that  punishment more bitter   Then my tenderhearted sister would never  taste mutton I suppose   No the sheep are given to us for food but I  would make them aa happy as I could while they  lived Ohl Tom we are commanded in the  Bible to be tenderhearted and merciful  and surely to be cruel is a grievous sin   I wonder that you did not crush the spider  that would have eaten up your bee   Why should 11 she did nothing wroilg  It is Nature that has taught her to live on such  food I would be merciful to spidery as well as  to bees   You carried off her dinner she would not  thank you for that   Perhaps I did foolishly said Minnie with a  smile but I cannot see a creature suffering  and not try to help it   I wish that you saw the greengrocers horse  with his bones all starting through his skin and  the marks of the blows on his head What  would you say to the master of that horse   Oh I wish that he would remember that  one verse from the Bible Blessed are the mer  ciful for they shall obtain mercy Without  mercy what would become of the best without  mercy we all should be ruined for ever and if  ordy the merciful can obtain mercy Oh t what  will become of the cruel   Pshaw cried Tom not able to dispute the  truth of Minnies words but not choosing to lis  ten to them for he had too many recollections of  birdnesting cockchaferspinning and wonying  of cats to make the subject agreeable Some  find it easier to silence an opponent with a   pshaw than by reason or strength of argu  ment and this was Toms usual way He did  not wish to continue the conversation and per  haps with a Tiew to change its subject said in  a sudden abrupt tone as he stirred his porridge  with his pewter spoon   Youve not put a morsel of sugar in my  bowl   Yes indeed I put some replied Minnie   But you know that I like plenty I have  told you so a thousand times   But dear Tom I have not plenty to give  you we have nearly come to the end of our  little store and you know continued she  lowering her voice that we cannot buy more  until we are paid for these shirts  The little giri did not add that for the last  three days she had not tasted any sugar herself   Nonsense cried Tom staiiiing up from his  seat and hastily entering the cottage He took  down from the shelf a large broken cup which  was used to contain the store of sugar Mrs  Wingfield was lying asleep in the back room  being laid np with a worse headache than usual  Fearing lest her mother should be roused from  her sleep Minnie followed her brother her finger  on her lip a look of anxious warning on her face  But both look and gesture were lost upon Tom  who was thinking of nothing but himself   Heres plenty for today he said in a care  less tone emptying half the supply into his  bowl   But Torn our poor mother she is ill you  know  « Well Tve not taken it all   But we cannot afford   Dont torment me cried Tom angrily  helping himself to more   Oh dear Tom said the little girl laying  her hand upon his arm   111 not stand this nonsense exclaimed the  boy fiercely and turning suddenly round he flung  the rest of the sugar into the dusty road   There that serves you right that will teach  you another time to mind your own business and  leave me alone and noisily setting down the  empty cup the boy sauntered out of the cottage  Something seemed to rise in Minnies throat   her heart was swelling her cheek was flushed  with mingled sorrow and indignation Oh how  much patience and meekness we require to meet  the daily little trials of life  Minnie was roused by her motheis feeble fret  fill voice I wish that you and Tom had a  little more feeling for me You have awoke me  with your noise 1   I am sorry that you have been disturbed  dear mother 111 try and not let it happen again  Do you fed better nowl   No one feels better for awaking with a start  returned Mrs Wingfield peevishly I should  not have expected such thoughtlessness from  you  Minnies eyes were so brimful of tears that  she dared not VaxA them lest the drops should  run over on her cheek She knew that her mother  would not like to see her cry so turning quietly  away she went to the small fire to make a little  tea for the invalid  There was nothing that Mrs Wingfield en  joyed like a cup of warm tea and when Minnie  brought one to the side of her bed with a nice  little piece of diy toast beside it even the sick  womans worn face looked almost cheerful As  soon however as she had tasted the tea she set  down the cup with a displeased air   Youve forgotten the sugar child   Not forgotten mother but but I have  none   More shame to you cried Mrs Wingfield  her pale ce flushing with anger I am sure  that a good deal was left this morning you  might have thought of your poor sick mother  she has few enough comforts I am sure  Poor Minnie she left the room with a very  heavy heart she felt for some minutes as if  nothing could cheer her Angry with her bro  ther grieved at her mother s undeserved reproach  as she again sat down to work in the little  porch her tears fell fast over her seam Pre  sently Conscience that inward monitor to whose  advice the little girl was accustomed to listen  began to make itself heard This is foolish  this is wrong dry up yocir tears they can but  give pain to your sick mother You must  patiently bear with the fretfulness of iUness and  not add to its burden by showing that you feel  it You know that you have not acted selfishly  you need not regret your own conduct in the  affair is not that the greatest of comforts  But I know very well still Conscience whis  pered in her heart that you never will feel  quite peaceful and happy till no anger remains  towards your brother A little sin disturbs  peace more than a great deal of sorrow ask for  aid to put away this sin  Minnie listened to the quiet voice of Con  Bcienoe and gradually her tears stopped and her  flushed cheek became cool She made a hundred  Rxcuses in her mind for poor Tom He had  been always much indulged he would be sorry  for what he had done how much better he was  than other boys that she knew who drank or  swore or stole And for herself what a sin it  was to have felt so miserable How many bless  ings were given her to enjoy She had health  and sight and fingers able to do work and  neither she nor her mother had difficulty in  procuring it the ladies around were so kind  Then there was the church and the school and  the best of books and the world was so beau  tiful with its bright sun and sweet flowers  there was so much to enjoy so much to be  thankful for And Minnie raised her eyes to  the blue sky above all dotted over with rosy  clouds for it was the hour of sunset and she  thought of the bright happy place to which her  dear father had gone and how she might hope  to join him there and never know sorrow again  What wonder with such sweet thoughts for her  companions if Minnie s face again grew bright  and she worked away in her little porch with a  feeling of peace and grateful love in her breast  which a monarch might have envied I  CHAPTER V  OONYEBSATION IN THE HIVE  Poor Sipsyrup 1 how sadly she stood at the  entrance of the hive where her gentle preserver  had left her The fine down of which she had  been so vain was aU rubbed and injured by her  struggles in the web one of her elegant wings was  torn she felt that all her beauty was gone She  had hardly courage to enter the hive and was  ashamed to be seen by the busy bees flocking in  and out of the door I am not sure that insects  can sigh or I am certain that she must have  sighed very deeply The first thing that gave  her the least feeling of comfort was the sound of  Silverwings friendly hum the poor wounded  insect exerted her feeble strength and crept  timidly into the hive   Sipsyrup can it be cried Honeyball  rousing herself from a nap as the bee brushed  past her   Sipsyrup looking as though she had been in  the wars exclaimed WaxywiU who in the  pride of her heart had always looked with con  tempt on her vain silly companion   My poor Sipsyrup cried Silverwing hasten  ing towards her Their feelers met that is the  way of ernbracinnr in Beeland the kind bee said  little but by every Mendly act in her power  shewed her pity and anxiety to give comfort  What pleased Sipsfyrup most was the absence  of Stickasting who had not returned to the hive  which she had left an hour before in a passion  After resting for a little on a halffinished cell  while Silverwing with her slender tongue gently  smothed her ruffled down and brought a drop of  honey to refresh her Sipsyrup felt well enough  to relate her sad story to which a little group of  surrounding bees listened with no small interest  Sipsyrup left altogether out of her account the  fine compliments paid her by Spinawpy she  could not bear tiiat her Yanity shoidd be known  but she gained little by hiding the truth as this  only made her folly appear more imacoount  able   I cannot understand said Waxywill how  any bee in her senses could fly into a web with  her eyes open r   When there was not even a drop of honey  to be gained by it hummed Honey ball  Sipsyrup hastened to the end of her story and  related how she jhad been sayed from the spider  by the timely help of a kind little girL   May she live upon eglantine all her life  exclaimed Silverwing with enthusiaBm and  have her home quite overflowing with honey  and pollen   This is the strangest part of your adven  tuxe said Honeyball this is the very first  time in my life that I eyer heard of kindness  shown to an insect by a human being   I thought that bees were sometimes fed by  them in winter suggested SHverwing   Fed with sugar and water 1 fit food for a  bee cried Honeyball roused to indignation  upon the only subject that stirred her up to  anything like excitement And have you  never heard how whole swarms have been bar  barously murdered smothered in the hive which  they had filled with so much labour that greedy  man might feast upon their spoils f   If you talk of greediness HoneybaJl drily  observed Waxywill I should say keep your  tongue in a sheath   I am glad that it is not the custom for men  to eat bees as well as their honey laughed  Silverwing   Oh they are barbarous to everything  whether they eat it or not exclaimed Waxywill  with an angry buTz Have I not seen a poor  butterfly basking in the sun glittering in her  vest of purple and gold Ah Sipsyrup in your  very best day you were no better than a black  beetle compared to her  An hour before Sipsyrup would have felt  ready to sting Waxywill for such an insolent  speech but the pride of the poor bee was  humbled and when Waxywill observed her  Bilenoeand noticed her drooping looks she  felt secretly ashamed of her provoking words  She continued Have I not seen the butterfly  I say dancing through the air as though life  was all sunshine and joy I have seen a boy  look on her not to admire not to feel pleasure  in beholding her beauty but eager to lay that  beauty in th dust and seize on his little victim  1 have Watched him creeping softly his hat in  his hand as anxious about his prize as if to  destroy a poor insects happiness was the way to  seciire his own Now the unconscious butterfly  rose high above the reach of her pursuer then  sank again to earth to rest upon a flower whose  tints were less bright than its wings Down  came the hat there was a shout from the boy  the butterfly was prisoner at last If he had  caught it to eat it as the spider caught Sipsyrup  I cQuld have forgiven him for men as well as  bees must have food and I suspect that they do  not live entirely upon honey but it made me  wish for a hundred stings when I saw the  wretched insect lying on the ground fluttering  in the agonies of death the boy had barbarously  torn off its bright beautiful wings and had not  even the mercy to put it out of pain by setting  his foot upon it   It had never injured him murmured  Silverwing   It had never injured any one it desired  nothing but to be allowed to spend its short life  in peace   How would the boy have liked to hare had  his wings torn off said Honeyball for the  amusement of some creature stronger than him  self   Men and boys are worse than hornets f  muttered Waxywill   But we have found one of humankind  hummed Silverwing cheerfully who could be  merciful even to a bee Perhaps in the world  there may be others like her too noble too  generous to use their strength to torture and  destroy what cannot resist them  Waxywill and Honeyball now took their  departure I fear rather for their own pleasure  than for the benefit of the hive as Waxywill  was not in a humour to work and Honeyball  was always in a humour to idle As soon as  they had flown out of reach of hearing poor Sip  syrup said in a very dull tone I wonder what  is to become of me now poor unhappy insect  that I am I fear that I shall never be able to  fly and to live on here in this wretched way is  almost worse than to be eaten by a spider I   Oh you shoidd not say so replied gentle  Silverwing you can still crawl about and you  are safe in your own home   Safe I am miserable With what pleasure  I had thought of joining the first swarm that  should fly off I am tired of the hive this noisy  bustling hive I have lost everything that I cared  for everything that made life pleasant my  beauty my strength my power of flying I have  nothing left   But your duties added Silverwing make  them your pleasures I My dear friend if you  no more can be pretty you may still be useful  if you no more can be admired you can still  be loved You may not be able to go far or to  see much but there are better joys to be found  in your own home  Before the night closed both the little nurse  bees were busy feeding the larvse  CHAPTER V  A BTINOINQ BEPBOOF  The Sunset was still casting a red glow over the  earth throwing the long shadows of the trees on  the ground and lighting up the cottage windows  as Polly Bright stood at the door of her cottage  watching for her mothers return  Mrs Bright was a hardworkmg woman who  during the absence of her husband a soldier in  the Crimea earned many an hoiest shilling as  char woman in the house of the Squire on the  hill She generally managed to let Polly have  the advantage of attending the school in the  morning though herself unable to read she  liked the idea of her daughter being a scholar  and as plain work was also taught in the school  she thought that what Polly acquired there might  make her not only more learned but more use  ful But it was only for attendance in the  morning that the char womans child could be  spared from her home During her mothers  frequent absence all the charge of the cottage  and care of the children belonged of course to  Polly Bright  I cannot say that the little parlour could com  pare in neatness with that of Mrs Wingfield  There was a chest of drawers in one of the cor  ners and on it was heaped a strange medley of  things Teapot and broken jug old shawl and  a babys rattle nutmegscraper bellows saucepan  and books were piled in sad confusion Nor  would I have advised you to have attempted to  open one of the drawers They were sometdmes  too full to be opened at all and stuck tight against  every effort as if aware that they were not fit to  be seen Polly was too fond of adorning herself  to care for adonung her cottage Bhe was not  aware how r better it looks to be simple neat  and dean and dressed according to our station  than to be decked oiit with gaudy finery and try  to ape the appearance of those whom Providence  has placed above us  You will remember that we visited this cot  tage in the third chapter and there is little  change in the appearance of things there now  The damp on the floor occasioned by Johnnys  accident has dried up and so have the tears of  the little boy who seated upon a stool near his  sisters feet is cramming his mouth with bread  and butter with an air of great content But  the thin sickly baby is stiQ in his cradle still  uttering his feeble unheeded wail for the poor  little creature is teething hard and has no other  way of expressing his pain Polly never notices  his heated lips and swelled gums she is more  occupied with herself tliis evening than usual  for Mrs Jjarkins the farmers wife has invited  her to tea and as soon as her mother returns to  take her place she will be off to amuse herself  at Greenhill Oh yes you might be certain  that some gay meeting was expected Look at  the necklace of false coral round her neck the  halfsoiled lace which she has sewn round her  frock and her hair all in papers at this hour of  the day you would laugh were yqu to see her  but to me the fidght of her folly is really too sad  for laughing Of what is she thinking as she  quickly untwists the papers and curls her long  hair round her fingers Her thoughts are  divided between impatience at her mothers  delay fears of herself being late for the party  and wishes that the pedlar would only happen  to call at her cottage  She had heard that day from one of her  schoolfellows that a man had been going about  the neighbourhood with a pack so ftdl of beauti  ful things that such a collection had never  before been seen in the village Polly had been  particularly tempted by the description of some  brooches made of false diamonds and exactly  like real ones as the girl who had never seen a  jewel in her life very positively affirmed One  of these fine brooches was to be had for six  pence how eager was Polly to be its possessor  She coimted over her little treasure of pence  and found that she had sufficient for the pur  chase  But how was she to find the pedlar Had  Polly not been tied to the cottage by what she  called these tiresome children she would long  ago have gone in search of him She could  hardly expect him to pass down her little lane  but she was near enough to the high road to see  if any one passed along it in going through the  Tillage At one time she liad set little Johnny  to watch and more than once her hopes had  been raised as the little feUow shouted aloud   Theres the man But Polly came running  first to see a drover th pigs then the baker  with his little cart going his rounds she had a  disappointment poor Johnny a slap and he was  sent crying into the cottage I This was rather  hard upon him poor little feUow How could  a child not three years old be expected to  know the difference between a pedlar and a  baker  But all was quiet again in the cottage Johnny  occupied with his supper and Polly with her  curlpapers when in through the open door who  should make her entrance but Stickasting She  came in as usual in no amiable mood quite  ready to take offence on the very shortest  notice She first settled on the little babys  arm but the infimt lay perfectly still halfcom  forted in his troubles by sucking his thumb  the most passionate bee in the world could find  no excuse for being angry with him Stick  asting rested for a few moments on the thin  tiny arm then rose and approached Polly  Bright  Every sensible person knows that when a bee  or a wasp hovers near the safest way is to keep  quiet and take no notice but Polly was not a  very sensible person and being not very cou  rageous neither was quite frightened when the  insect touched her face If Stickasting had mis  taken it for a flower she would very soon have  found out her blunder and left the little girl in  peace but starting back with a cry Polly  struck the bee and Stickasting roused to fury  quickly returned the blowl Mad with passion  the insect struck her sting so deep that it was  impossible to withdraw it again and she left  it behind which occasions certain death to a  bee  Stickasting felt at once that she had thrown  away her life in a wild desire for revenge that  her destruction was caused by her own violent  act she crawled feebly a few inches from the  spot where she fell and expired a victim to  her temper  Loud was the scream which Polly Bright  uttered on being stung so loud that it brought  from the opposite cottage both Minnie Wiog  field and her brother On finding out the cause  of PoUys distress Minnie hastily ran back for  the bluebag or a little honey to relieve the  pain of her schoolfellow But Tom who had  very little pity in his nature stood shaking with  laughter at the adventure   Stung by a beel stung on the very tip of  the nose what a beauty you will look at Green  hill tonight ha ha ha if 70a oould only see  how funny you look your hair half in curlpapers  and half hanging down and your eyes as red  with crying as the coral iound your neck You  are for all the world like dlly Sally t   It does not show much does itf said poor  Folly anxiously as Minnie returned with the  bluebag   It is swelling cried Tom swelling higher  and higher twill be just like the turkeycocks  comb   Then I cant go tonight I wiU not go  exclaimed Polly sitting down and bursting into  tears  Tom laughed louder Minnie in vain tried to  comfort all Pollys happiness was for the time  overthrown by a bee It rested but on trifles  and a trifle was enough to make her wretched  for the rest of that day  CHAPTER VII  A WONDERFUL BORE  The sun set the rooks in the squires park had  gone to roost the bats flew round the ivycovered  tower of the village church The hive was  becoming quiet and still the bees hanging in  dusters prepared to go to sleep but Stickastmg  had never returned 1 Silverwing listened in vain  for the Wellknown sound of her angry hum and  wondered what could have delayed her com  panion But never again was the poor bee to  Hy back to the hive never again to labour at the  waxen cells aitid alas how little was her  presence missed still less was it regretted  The next morning was warm bright and  sunny the bees were early on the wing The  larvae were beginning to spin their webs and  therefore no longer required food so Silverwing  was free to range over the fields and gather  honey for the hive So tempting was the day  that even Honeyball shook her lazy wings and  crept to the door there stood for a few  moments jostled by her more active fellowser  vants and finally flew off in quest of food  How delightful was the air how fragrant  the breeze 1 The buttercups spread their carpet  of gold and the daisies their mantle of silver  over the meadows all glittering with the drops  of bright dew Honeyball soon found a flower  to her taste and never thought of quitting it till  she had exhausted all its honied store She had  a dim idea that it was her duty to help to fill  the cells but poor Honeyball was too apt to  prefer pleasure to duty   I should like to have nothing to do she  murnmred litiJe thinking that a listener was  near   like to have nothing to do Is it from a  hivebee that I hear such words from one  whose labour is itself all play Honeyball  turned to view the speaker and beheld on a sign  post near her the most beautifrd bee that shehad  ever seen Her body was larger than that of a  hivebee and her wings were of a lovely violet  colour like the softest tint of the rainbow  Honeyball felt a little confused by the address  and a little ashamed of her own speech but as  all bees consider each other as cousins felt it  best to put on a frank easy air   Why certainly flying about upon a morn  ing like this and making elegarU extracts frtm  flowers is pleasant enough for a time But may  I ask ladybee contined Honeyball if you  think as lightly of working iq wax   Working in wax half contemptuously  replied Violetta a soffc thing which you can  bend and twist any way and knead into any  shape that you choose Come and look at my  home here and then ask yourself if you have  any reason to complain of your work   Naturalists doubt whether the ioletbee is a native  of Britain It ia known that one species of carpenter  bees ia to be found in England ibut the one descnbed  above probably belongs to foreign lands  Honeyball looked forward with her two  honeycombed eyes and upwards and backwards  with her three others but not the shadow of a  hire could she perceive anywhere May I  venture to ask where you live said she at  last   This way cried Violetta waving her feeler  and pointing to a little round hole in the post  which Honeyball had not noticed before It  looked gloomy and dark and strange to the  bee but Violetta who took some pride in her  mansion requested Honeyball to step in   You cannot doubt my honour said she  observing that the hiveworker hesitated or be  suspicious of a cousin Honeyball assured her  that she had never dreamed of such a thing and  entered the hole in the post  For about an inch the way sloped gently  downwards then suddenly became straight as a  weU so dark and so deep that Honeyball would  have never attempted to reach the bottom had  she not feared to offend her new acquintance  She had some hopes that this perpendicular pas  sage might only be a long entrance leading to  some cheerful hive but after having explored  to the very end and having found nothing but  wood to reward her search she crept again up  the steep narrow way and with joy found her  self once more in the sunshine   What do you tliink of it said Yioletta  rather proudly   I I do not think that your hive would  hold many bees Is it perfectly finifdied may I  inquire i   No I have yet to divide it into chambers  for my children each chamber filled with a  mixture of pollen and honey and divided from  the next by a ceiling of sawdust But the boring  was finished today   Tou do not mean to say exclaimed Honey  ball in surprise that that long gallery was ever  bored by bees   Kot by heeSf replied Yioletta with a dignified  bow but by one bee I bored it all myself  The indolent Honeyball could not conceal her  amazement Is it possible that you sawed it  all outwith your teeth 1   Every inch of the depth Yioletta replied   And that you can gather honey and pollen  enough to fill itl   I must provide for my children or they  woxdd starve   And you can make ceilings of such a thing  as sawdust to divide your home into cells V   This is perhaps the hardest part of my task  but nevertheless this must be done   Where will you find sawdust for this car  penters work   See jonder little heap I have gathered it  together those are my cattmgs from my tunnel  in the wood   You are without doubt a most wonderftii  bee And you really labour all alone T   All alone replied Violetta  Honeyball thought of her own cheerful hive  with its thousands of workers and divisions of  labour and waxen cells dropping with golden  honey she scarcely could believe her own five  eyes when she saw what one persevering insect  could do Her surprise and her praise pleased  the violetbee who took pride in shewing every  part of her work describing her difficulties and  explaining her manner of working   One thing strikes me said Honeyball  glancing down the tunnel I should not much  like to have the place of your eldest larva im  prisoned down there in the lowest cell unable  to stir till all her sisters have eaten their way  into daylight  Violetta gave what in Beeland is considered  a smile I have thought of that difficulty  and of a remedy too I am about to bore a  little hole at the end of my tunnel to give the  young bee a way of escape from its prison And  now added Violetta I will detain you no  longer so much remains to be done and time is  so precious You probably have something to  collect for your live I am too much your friend  to wish you to be idle  Honeyball thanked her new acquaintance and  flew away somewhat the wiser for her visit  but feeling that not for ten pairs of purple wings  would she change places with the carpenterbee  CHAPTER VIII  A CHA8B AND ITS CONSEQTTENCES   Theres the pedlar Oh dear and just as  mother has gone out cried Polly who on  beginning her afternoon business of nurse to the  little children saw or thought that she saw at  the end of her lane a man with a pack travelling  along the high road There he is Oh if I  could only stop him or if any one would look  after the baby whilst I am gone Minnie Wing  field Ah 1 how stupid I am to forget that she  is now at the afternoon school I think that  baby would keep very quiet for five minutes he  cannot roll out of his cradle but Johnny hed  be tumbling down or setting the cottage on fire  I cannot leave him for a minute by himself   Johnny said she suddenly I want to catch  the pedlar and see his pretty things will you  come with me like a good little boyi  Johnny scrambled to his feet in a moment to  the full as eager as herself Polly held his fkt  little hand tight within her own and began run  ning as hst as she could drag him along But  the poor childs round heavy figure and short  steps were altogether unsuited for anything like  a race Polly felt him as a dead weight hanging  to her arm in vain she pulled dragged and  jerked now began to encourage and now to  scold poor Johnny became tired irightened and  out of breath and at last fairly tumbled upon  his face   Get up Tm in such a hurry no answer  but a roar Stupid child hell be gone I  Johnny bellowed louder than before There  m leave you on the road you great tiresome  boy I you have half pulled out my arm with  dragging you on Ill leave you there and silly  Sally may get ou  Then without heeding the poor little childs  cries and entreaties that she would stop as he  lay on the ground half suffocated with sobs  Polly Bright thinking only of the prize which  her vanity made her so much desire hastened  after the pedlar  Silly Sally who has been twice mentioned in  my tale was a poor idiot woman who lived with  some kind neighbours on a common about two  miles from the village She was perfectly harmlesu  and therefore allowed to go about with freedom  wherever she chose but the terrible misfortune  alas exposed her to the scorn and sometimes  even persecution of wicked children who made  the worst use of the senses left them hj torment  ing one already so much afflicted Poor Sally  used to wander about the lanes uttering her  unmeaning sound Perhaps even she had some  pleasure in life when the sun shone brightly and  the flowers were out for she would gather the  wild rose from thie bank or the scarlet poppies  from the field and weave them into garlands for  her head iNothing pleased her more than when  she found a long feather to add to her gaudy  wreath if the poor witless creature had delight  in making herself gay Polly at least had no  right to laugh at her  Timid and easily frightened the idiot felt a  nervous terror for schoolboys for which they  had given her but too much cause She had  been hooted at even pelted with mud pursued  with laughter like a hunted beast twice had  Minnie to interfere with her brother pleading  even with tears for one so helpless and unhappy  If there be anything more brutal and hateful  than cruelty to a harmless animal it is heartless  barbarity to a defenceless idiot to one who  bears our image is descended from our race and  whose only crime is the being most unfortunate  Deal gently dear children with the poor sense  less idiot we trust that there is a plaee in  heaven even for him the powers denied him in  this world may be granted in the next and in a  brighter realm although never here below he  may be found at his Lords feet clothed cmd in  his right mind  On hastened the little girl breathless and  panting At the place where the roads joined  she looked anxiously up the highway to see if  she had not been mistaken in her distant view of  the traveller No there was the pedlar pack  and all and no mistake but walking more briskly  than might have been expected from his burden  and the warmth of the afternoon his pack must  have been much lightened since he first set out  vith it  Polly called out but he either did not hear  or did not attend the wind was blowing the  dust in her face she was tired with her vain  attempts to drag poor Johnny her shoes were  down at heel and hindered her running for it by  no means follows that those who wish to be fine  care to be tidy also But the brooch of false  diamonds the coveted brooch the thought of   that urged her on to still greater efforts even  the remembrance of her swelled nose was lost in  the hope of possessing such a beautiful orna  ment 1 Polly as she shuffled hastily along saw  more than one person meet the pedlar if thev  would but stop him if only for one minute to  give her time to get up with him at last No  one stopped him how fast he seemed to walk  Follys face was flushed and heated her hair  hung about her ears would that we were as  eager and perseyering in the pursuit of what  really is precious as the girl was in that of a  worthless toy  At last her gaapedout Stop reached the  ear of the pedlar he paused and turned round  and in a few minutes more his pack was opened  to the adminng eyes of Polly Ah how she  coveted this thing and that how she wished that  her six pennies were shillings instead Acheny  ooloured neckerchief a pink silk lace a large  steel pin and a jewelled ring how they took her  ncy and made her feel how difficult it is to  decide when surrounded by many things alike  tempting  But at last the wonderful brooch of false  diamonds was produced there was only one left  in the pedlars stock how fortimate did Polly  think it that it also had not been sold necker  chief lace pin or ring as nothing compared to  this She tried it on had some doubts of the  strength of the pin tried in vain to obtain a  lessening of the price it ended in the girls  placing all her pence in the hand of the pedlai  and cairying home h prize with delight She  had had her insh her yanity was gratified the  brooch was her own but to possess is not always  to enjoy  Polly returned to her cottage with much  slower steps she was heated and tired and  perhaps a little conscious that she had not been  faithful to her trust As she came near her  home she quickened her pace for to her surprise  she heard Yoices within and Yoices whose tones  told of anxiety and fear These were the words  which struck her ear and made her pause ere  she yentured to enter   What a mercy it is that I returned for the  basket that I had forgotten if I had not what  would have become of my poor babe r exclaimed  Mrs Bright in much agitation   I cant understand how it happened replied  another voice which Polly knew to be that of  Mrs Wingfield   You may well say that said the mother  Polly could hear that she was rocking her chair  backwards and forwards as she sometimes did  when hushing the sick child to sleep I left  Polly in charge of the children I came back to  find her gone and my poor poor baby in a fit  Polly turned cold and trembled so that she  could hardly stand   Is there no one who could go for a doctor 1  continaed the agitated moth another fit  may come on I would give the world to see  him   I am so feeble replied Mrs Wingfield that  I am aaid   Take the baby then and Til go myself not  a moment is to be lost   No no theres my boy Tom cried Mrs  Wingfield as she saw her son ran hastily into  her little cottage which was just opposite to  Mrs Brights   Oh send him in mercy send him cried  the mother and her neighbour instantly crossed  over to fulfil her wishes passLug Polly as she  did so and looking at her with mingled surprise  and scorn though in too much haste to address  her   My boy my own darling murmured the  anxious mother pressing her sick child to her  bosom what will your father say when he  hears of this Except her low sad voice the  cottage was so still that the very silence was  terrible to Polly it would have been a relief to  have heard the feeble fretful wail which had  made her feel impatient so often I  With pale anxious face and noiseless step  dreading to meet her mothers eye the imhappy  girl stole into the cottage There sat Mrs  Bright her bonnet thrown back from her head  her hair hanging loose her gaze fixed upon the  child in her arms whilst the poor little babe  with livid waxen features and halfclosed eyes  lay so quiet and looked so terribly ill that but  for his hard Kreathing his sister would have  feared that his life had indeed passed away  Mrs Bright raised her head as Polly entered  and regarded her with a look whose expression  of deep grief was even more terrible than anger  She asked no question perhaps the misery in  which she saw the poor girl made her unwilling  to add to her suffering by reproach or perhaps  and this was Pollys own bitter thought she  considered her unworthy of a word Whatever  was the cause no conversation passed between  them except a few short directions from the  mother about things connected with the comfort  of the baby as poor Polly with an almost burst  ing heart tried to do anything and everything  for him  In the meantime Tom had gone for the doctor  though with an unwillingness and desire to delay  which had made his mother both surprised and  indignant   He should go by the fields he said though  he well knew that to be the longest way and he  would have done so had not Mrs Wingfield  roused herself to such anger that even her rude  nd undutiful son did not dare to disobey her  The doctor came in about an hoar Tom hav  ing happily found him at home and with an  anxiety which those who have attended beloved  ones in the hour of sickness only can tell Mrs  Bright and Polly listened for his opinion of the  case ThS doctor examined the child and asked  questions concerning his illness How long had  the fit lasted There was a most painful pause  Mrs Bright looked at her daughtej Polly could  not utter a word it was not till the question  was repeated that the distressing reply No one  knows was given   Was the child long ailing T   How wa he when you left himf said Mrs  Bright to the miserable Polly   Yery well thats to say I dont exactly  he was I think   There has been gross negligence here said  the doctor sternly gross negligence he re  peated and it may cost the child his life  Polly could only clasp her hands in anguish  but the mother exclaimed Oh sir is there no  hope for my boy I   While there is life there is hope replied the  doctor in a more kindly tone he must be bled  at once Have you a basin here he added  taking a small instrumentcase from his pocket  PoUy was at all times timid and nervous and  quite unaccustomed to selfcommand and now  when she would have given worlds to have been  useful her hand shook so violently her feelings  BO overcame her that there was no chance of her  doing anything but harm   Give the basin to me dear said a gentle  voice behind her Minnie Wingfiela had just  entered the cottage You look so ill you must  not be present go up stairs Polly I will help  your mother   Oh what shall I doT cried the miserable  girl wringing her hands   Go and pray whispered Minnie as she  glided from her side and Polly trembling and  weeping slowly went up the narrow wooden  staircase and entering her little chamber sank  down upon her knees   Oh spare him only spare him my darling  little brother r she could at first utter no other  words She had never loved the baby as she did  now when she feared that she might be about to  lose him and bitterly she lamented her own  impatient temper that had madiB her weary of the  duty of tending him Oh that we would so act  towards our relations that if death should  remove any one from our home oitr grief should  not be embittered by the thought I was no  comfort or blessing to him while he was here and  now the opportunity of being so is gone for  ever  A CHABE AND ITS OONiiQUENCEa Go  But the most tenible thought to Polly was  that the babys dauger might be partly owing to  her neglect should he die should the little  darling be taken away could her mother ever  forgive her As Polly sobbed in an agony of  grief something fell from her bosom upon the  floor she started at the sight of her forgotten  brooch that whioh she had coveted so much  that which had cost her so dear Snatching it  up and springing to her feet with a sudden  impidse she ran to the window and flung it far  out into the lane Then once more falling on  her knees again she prayed but more calmly and  she implored not only that the baby might live  but that her own weak vain heart might be  cleansed that she might henceforth live not only  for herself but do her duty as a faithful servant  of God She rose somewhat comforted and  creeping downstairs listened ere sHe ventured to  enter the little parlour   I hope that he may do well now I shall send  something for him tonight keep him quiet  I shall call here tomorrow These were the  doctors parting words and they were a great  relief to Polly She came in softly and bent  down by the baby now laid again in his little  cradle and looking white as the sheet that was  over him she would have kissed his thin pale  face but she feared to disturb the poor child  Her heart waa full of mingled sorrow and love she  felt as though she could never bear to leave him  again   Thank you JMinnie my girl said Mrs  Bright earnestly you have been a real comfort  to me in my time of need Your mother is a  happy woman to have such a child   Can I do anything else for you nowl said  Minnie if you would allow me to sit up  instead of you tonight r   No no I could not cl6se an eye But I  should be glad if you would bring Johnny home  my dear it is near his bedtime and I do not  think that he will disturb the baby   I will bring him with pleasure where is  her said Minnie   Where is hef repeated Mrs Bright is he  not at your home   No he has not been there all day Polly  started as if she had been stabbed   Then where is he cried Mrs Bright looking  anxiously round is he upstairs Polly The  miserable girl shook her head Her fears for the  baby had made her quite forget her little brother  and it now flashed across her mind that she had  not passed him in the lane when she had retraced  her steps to the cottage Where could he have  gone where could he be now  Mrs Bright had endured much but her cup  A CHASE AND ITS CX17SBQUENC£S 67  seemed now to overflow she walked close up to  Polly laid a heavy grasp upon her shoulder and  said in a tone which the girl remembered to her  dying day When was your brother last with  your   About two hours ago just before you  returned home faltered Polly   And where did you leave him V   In the lane near the highroad   Go and find him said the mother between  her clenched teeth or never let me set eyes on  you again  Polly rushed out of the cottage and began her  anxious search up and down the lane by the  hedge in the ditch along the road asking every  person that she met and from every one receiving  the same disheartening answer Ko one had  seen the boy no one could think what had  lecome of him he was too young to have wan  dered far had he run towards the road he must  liave been met by Polly if the other way he  must have been seen by his mother he could  not have got over the hedge there was no possi  bility of his having lost his way Many neigh  bours joined in the search many pitied the  unhappy mother but she was less to be pitied  than Polly  CHAPTER IX  PBISONS AND PBISONBBS  We will DOW retiim to our little friend Honey  ball whom we left flying from the cnrious dwell  ing of the carpenterbee We will follow her as  she lazily proceeded along the lane in which were  situated the cottages of Mrs Wingfield and Mrs  Bright the sweet flowers in the garden of the  former rendering it a favourite resort for bees  This was not long after noon and therefore a  few hours before all the troubles related in the  last chapter had occurred while Polly and her  two little charges were yet safe in their own  comfortable cottage  Honeyball looked at Spinaway busily mending  her net torn by the adventure of Sipsyrup and  laughed as she thought of the folly of her com  panion Honeyball was not vain enough to be  enticed by sugared words her dangers arose from  quite another source her greediness and great  selfindulgence Her eye was now attracted by  a little bottle hung up by the porch not far  from the rosebush it had been placed there by  Tom to catch wasps perhaps he had hoped to  entrap some others of the winged tribes for he  had just taken a fancy to make a collection of  insects and woe unto any small creature that  xniglit UR into bis merqiless hands  Honeyball alighted on the bottle then flut  tered to the top allured hj the sugary scent  The brim was sticky she unsheathed her long  lright tongue tasted approved and then sipped  again At this moment she heard a buzz near  her and looking up with her bac eyes perceived  her friend Silviwing   Do come from that huge bright hard cell  cried the bee I am sure that it never was  formed by any of our tribe and I do not believe  that it holds honey   It holds something very good and in such  abundance too replied Honeyball a thousand  honeysuckles would not contain so much   There is danger I am certain that there is  danger I cried Silver wing what if it should  have been placed there on purpose to catch usi   You think me as foolish as Sipsyrup  « Ko not foolish but   Too fond of good living and too lazy to like  trouble in procuring it Well I daresay that  you are right Silverwing I believe that as you  say there may be danger   Then why not corae away 2 persisted the bee   Because the taste is so good said her com  panion bending over the rim the next moment  she was struggling in the syrup  Ah Honejball weak foolish insect In  Tain do you struggle ii vain do you buzz in  vain your grieved friend flutters against the  glass you have sacrificed yourself for a little  indulgence like thousands who look at the tempir  ing glass know their danger yet will not abstain  As Silverwing on the outside of the bottle  was uttering her hum of pity and rogret sud  denly a handkerchief was thrown over her and  the loud rough voice of Tom was heard   Bather a paltiy beginning to my collection  a wretched hivebee But I have caught it so  cleverly without its being crushed or spoiled by  the syrup and I will keep it till I get that stuff  which Ben told me of which kills insects without  hurting their beauty 1  Poor unhappy Silverwing she was indeed in  a terrible position she had not even power to  use her sting in selfdefence for to plunge it into  the handkerchief would have been useless indeed  and she felt all that a bee might be expected to  feel in the power of its most cruel foe Tom  carried her into the cottage and carefolly un  clofiing the handkerchief after he had moimted  upon a chair to reach the shelf easily he shook  his poor prisoner into his own mug and tied  some paper firmly over the top  Silverwing flew round and round buzzing in  terror she only hurt her wings against the  sides Then she crawled over the paper which  formed thcr ceiling of her prison but no hole for  escape could she find It was clear that she was  now shut out from all hope condemned perhaps  to some lingering death while her companions  were flying about busy and happy she was to  pine a lonely prisoner here At first her feel  ings were those of despair then quietly though  sadly she made up her mind to submit to her  cruel fate She no longer fluttered about rest  lessly but settling at the bottom of the mug in  patience awaited the return of her tormentor  Hours passed before Tom came back there  had been other voices in the cottage but no one  had touched the place of Silverwing s imprison  ment Mrs Wingfield had been called out hastily  by her neighbour Mrs Bright on the discovery  of the illness of the baby and as Minnie had  not then returned from school the cottage was  left quite empty Presently there was a rapid  step then the sound of some one jumping up on  the chair Silverwing felt the mug moved then  the paper raised she was ready to make a last  eflbrt to escape through the opening but her  little tyrant took good care to give no time for  that he only shook in another victim and then  shut down the paper quickly and placed a book  on the top  Silverwing paid no attention to what w  passing in tke cottage round ber tbough I may  OB well remind the reader of what passed in the  labt chapter how Tom had scarcely got down  from the chair before bis mother came in and  ordered him to go off in haste for the doctor as  Mrs Brights baby was very ill indeed how  Tom hesitated and said that be would go by the  fields and then was sent off direct by bis mother  in much displeasure To all this as I said Sil  verwihg paid no attention ber little world was  contained ih the mug and all ber interest was  arouaed by her fellowprisoner Poor Violetta  with bei fine purple wings was the prey of the  collector of insects He had not caired to explore  ber curious home to learn her customs and ways  or admire ber instinct be only wished to have  the dead body of an insect that he thought curi  ous and had no scruple about destroying it to  gratify this wish  Violetta was not so patient as poor Silverwing  had been She dashed herself against the mug  in passionate distress she would listen to no  words of comfort Then she vainly tried to  exercise her wonderful powers of gnawing from  a wooden box she perhaps might have W»rked  ber way to freedom but the bard slippery  crockery resisted her utmost efforts her poor  little teeth could not even make an impression i  Exhausted at last she remained quite still and  JBilverwing forgetful of ker own distress began  to attempt to soothe her oompanion  Thus they remained till the evening without  food almost without hope Mrs Wingfield had  gone to Attempt to comfort her neighbour nearly  wild at the loss of her Johnny and now Minnie  and Tom both entered the cottage together  Their conversation had no interest for the bees  in their mug but as it is possible that it may  have some for my reader I shall proceed to give  some account of it in the following apter  CHAPTEE X  A GONFBSSION   Oh Tom said Minnie is not thm a terrible  mififortune that has happened to poor Mrs«  Bright r  Tom gave a rt of grunt of assent   And the baby so ill Motr doubts that  he will live over the night I am glad that you  found the doctor so soon But what can have  become of dear little Johnny i The Barnes and  the Smiths have been all on the search they  Hay that if the wind had not been blowing the  dust so much along the lane the little fdlow  might have been tracked by his footsteps Nr  one can imagine where he can have gone he ia  o very young so unable to wander far Poor  Polly I am so sorry for her   I wish that you would not be talking for  ever about Johnny 1 exclaimed Tom in a petu  lant tone   How can one think or talk of anything  elser replied Minnie sadly I did so love that  noble boy 1   Have done with it cried her brother more  angrily than before  Minnie looked at him with pain and then  said in a low tone I thought that you had  even joined in the search   I have joined I would give anything to  find him T exclaimed Tom striking his hand on  the table as he spoke with such passionate energy  that he almost startled his sister   Did you see nothing of the dear child said  Minnie as a thought suddenly occurred to her   when you came to our cottage just before you  went for the doctor you know V   Didnt I tell you that I wanted to hear no  more about the matter cried Tom his whole  face becoming the colour of crimson  Minnies eyes were fixed upon him steadily  earnestly rude bold boy as he was he shrank  from her piercing gaze Going nearer to her  brother and speaking very distinctly but in a  voice hardly above a whisper she said I be  Keve that you know more about Johnny than  you will teU   Believe what you like and let me alone   Tom I implore you hide nothing from us  Oh think of the misery of the poor broken  hearted mother and she laid her hand upon  his arm   Speak another word and 111 strike you  eried Tom roughly shaking her off   Strike me if you will but I Tmist speak  Where did you see that child last f   You can get nothing out of me growled  Tom   Then I must call those who can said Minnie  firmly turning round as if to quit the cottage   This is a matter of life or death She looked  pale but very determined   Whom are you going to call said Tom his  manner betraying some fear   My mother if necessary the clergyman  or the magistrate Tom caught her by the  arm as he exclaimed Stop Minnie oh stop  you shall hear all and judge I dont know  where the boy is I would give my right hand  that I did it is true that I saw him last and  I have searched aU the place again and again  You would not betray me you would not  Minnie you might ruin me but could not  help Jobimy Sit dowa here and liien to me  quietly and you shall know everything that hafi  happened  Minnie sat down beside him her heart beat  ing jBnAt He gave her a short but true acoount of  what had passed omitting however some little  particulars whioh we shall relate more at length  You will remember that we left poor Johnny  crying in the lane vainly trying to call bade his  sister as she hurried in purstut of the pedlar  When the child found his terrors unheeded his  loud roar gradually sank into a low broken sob  he scrambled to his feet rubbed his plump dusty  hand across his eyes to brush away the tears  and began to think of trotting back to the  oottage  Just as the little fellow was commencing his  journey he heard a voice call him £rpm the  other side of the hedge which bordered the nar  row lane At first iicying that it might be  silly Sally with whom he had been threatened  Johnny was inclined to run the faster for the  call but he soon knew Tom when he saw him  clambering over and holding something in his  hand   Heres something for you my jolly little  man cried Tom who amused himself some  times by playing with but more ten by teasing  his little rosycheeked neighbour  What goti asked the cMid as Tom jumped  down beside him Johmij was always sparing  of his words   A nest of little birds that was swinging on  a bough I knocked off the nest and down caane  the birds   All dead f said Johnny sadly   Why yes you see they had some way to  £dl the little things broke their necks so there  was an end of them   Poor ittle birds knocked off tree said  the pitying child Tom was provoked at seeing  the pity   What a siUy little goose you are Johnny  It was fine fiin to set nest and all aflying and  finish the whole family at once  But whatever might be the opinion of Tom  the plump little cottager kept to his own and  only more sadly repeated the words Poor ittle  birds knocked off tree   Oh I if youVe such a fancy for swinging on  a tree weUl have you up directly and make an   ittle bird of you I and laughing at the strug  gles and entreaties of the child Tom suddenly  lifted him over the hedge and followed him into  the field fiinging the wretched dead birds into a  ditch  In Tain Johnny kicked and pushed and roared  Tom was a remarkably tall and strong boy and  catching the poor child up in his arms he tan  with him across the field 1 There was another  hedge at the opposite side which Tom passed as  easily as he had done the first and they now  found themselves at the edge of a wood thickly  filled with trees of YArious sizes  It wad a delight to Tom to cause terror and  alarm no feeling of pity with him ever cut  short a joke In a few moments poor Johnny  was perched upon a branch clinging and roaring  with all his might   There ittle bird I hope that you like  your bough shall I shake it an ittle just to  give you a nice swing Hold tight mind you  dont fall or youll break your fiit neck as the  iitle birds did Then he began to sing   Hushaby baby on the treetop  When the wind blows the cradle will rook  When the bough breaks the cradle wiU U  Down comes poor baby cradle and all  How long Tom might have gone on torment  ing the child no one can tell if suddenly he had  not been struck by the appearance of a curious  bee which had sJighted for a moment upon a  wildflower near   Oh what a splendid bee f he cried leaving  hold of the branch to which Johnny still clung   Sit you there till I catch it isnt it a beauty   I never saw such fine purple wings I  My reader has probably guessed that it was  poor Violetta whose fatal beauty had attracted  his eye Johnny and his terrors all were for  gotten while Tom rushed forward in eager  pursuit the frightened child stopping his cry  ing to watch the chase which ended in Toms  securing his prize in his handkerchief  Impatient to carry it at once to a safe place  aaid of its either escaping or being crushed in  his hold Tom whose cottage was so near that  he could reach it in a few minutes sprang over  the hedge and ran fast across the field Thus  Johnny was left in a position of some peril not  knowing how long the boys absence might be  he shouted as loudly and as vainly after Tom as  he befoie had done after his sister   And did you not return soon cried Min  nie as Tom reached this part of his story   How could II Mother sent me off directly  for the doctor   Oh why why did you not tell her   Yeiy likely indeed that I should tell her  that I had left little Johnny sticking in a tree  I could only hope that he would stick there  until I could get back I returned at full speed  from the doctors I can assure you but when I  reached the wood not a trace of the little fellow  could I find   Oh Tom exclaimed Minnie with a look  of horror such a terrible thought has strack  me   I daresay that it has struck me before  gloomily replied her brother  « Was it Oh was it fer from the wellT   If hes there said Tom in a hollow voice   hes dead long before now   Did you seareh there 1   I looked down and saw nothing   Looked down Oh Tom this is worse than  mockery If the waters were above him it is  so deep so dark   What is to be done exclaimed the boy   Some one must go down in the bucket  Oh there is not a moment to be lost Minnie  would have rushed from the cottage but her  brother held her fast   There is no use in rousing the village now  he cried do you mean to ruin to destroy  me Minnie if you betray me if it is found  that the child is drowned people will say that   that and his look of terror told a great deal  more lian his words   But you never threw him in it was only  foolish play   Who can prove that Oh Minnie would  you bring me to a jail or perhaps to worse f   Then let us go ourselv exclaimed the  little girl divided between anxiety for her  bityther and fears for the lost child I must  either go or send and if there is danger to  you   We will go do anythiiig only in pity be  silent Minnie Minnie you cannot tell how  miserable I am 1  Without pausing another moment both ran  out of the cottage only fearful lest they should  be seen and detained Tom helped Minnie over  the low hedge but she hardly needed help so  eager was she to reach the weU The rosetint  of sunset had now given place to evenings grey   the dew was falling dark clouds gathered over  the sky but heeding nothing pausing for no  thing the Wingfields pressed on and were soon  standing by the sid of the welL  CHAPTER XI  A SUDDEN FALL   What has become of these two children of  mine said Mrs Wincfield fretfully as on her  return from her neigh Ws she fod the cot  tae empty Tm sure such a day of bustle as  I have had scarce out of one trouble before I  am into another WeU poor Mrs Bright is  still worse off that is one thing I am glad  that the baby has at last dropped asleep  It grew darker and darker Mrs Wingfield  became uneasy She stirred the fire filled the  kettle then with a long weary sigh sat down to  rest she missed Minnie and her quiet atten  tions   I suppose that they are still out searching  for little Johnny I fear that there will be rain   I wish that they were back Mrs Wingfield  fancied that she heard a low knock at the door   Come in she said but no one entered  Mrs Wingfield drew her chair nearer to the fire  leaned her head upon her hand and wished that  Tom and Minnie would not stay out so late  Again the same low knock she called out  louder Come in and the faint light which  came through the doorway was darkened by a  figure which seemed to linger as if in tear on  the threshold Then the voice of poor Polly was  heard Oh Mrs Wingfield can you tell me  how baby is   What Polly is that you Come in my  poor child all cold and wet with the dew  Why dont you go home   I dare not said Polly bursting into tears   mother forbade m till Johnny is found Oh  tell me how baby is is he better will he liveT  she could hardly speak through her sobs   Yes he is better that is to say he is  asleep   Not deadr exclaimed Polly alarmed at  the word  Dead no child why how you tremble  Come to the fire 111 get you a little tea and  toast   I could not eat it would choke me Oh  that I had never lefib the children that I had  done my duty as Minnie would have done She  she has been a comfort in her home but I   Come come said Mrs Wingfield in a  soothing tone dont go breaking your heart in  this way all may come right at last Would not  you like to see the baby   Oh if I might only sit up with him all  night But I may not return without Johnny   Your mother never meant that come 111  take you to her myself when she sees how you  feel all this I am sure that she will forgive  you   Mrs Wingfield was a kindhearted woman  and taking Pollys trembling hand within her  own she crossed over the lane to Mrs Brights  Polly shrank back as they reached the door   Oh say do you bring me news of my  child cried the poor anxious woman from  within   Not of Johnny yet still of your child Therp  is one here who is aaid to oome in poor things  she has almost cried herself to death   Polly 1 murmnred the mother and stretched  out her arms in another moment the poor girl  was gobbing upon her bosom  Amidst the troubles of our human Mends we  must not quite forget those of our little winged  ones The frightened hungry bees confined in  their small prison passed the long hours in most  uncomfortable plight   What a bitter thing it is cried Violetta  sinking exhausted after a last effort to gnaw  through the unyielding crockery to think of  aU the joy and happiness left in the world from  which we are shut out for ever Tomorrow the  ark will be rising on high the butterfly flitting  over the daisied meadow your comrades feast  ing in the dewy flowers all Nature one hum of  lifel   I am glad that they can enjoy still there is  some comfort in that said Silverwing   That is a feeling which I cannot under  stand observed Yioletta It is strange that  the very same thought should give pain to me  and pleasure to you 1  Yioletta had had no great experience of life  or she would have known that such is often the  case Living by herself as a solitaxy insect she  had never heard one of the mottoes cf Beeland  Ffom the Mosaom of a cormradea success one  draws the poison of etwy wnother the howsy of  ddight  The village churchclock had struck tiie hour  of nine it was seldom that its sound could be  heard in ie cottage of Mrs Wingfield but now  the place was so still that the breeze bore it dis  tinctly to her listening ear Weary she lay oti  her bed unwilling to sleep till her children  should return The rain was beginning to fall  without the heavy douds bending towards  earthy made the nht much darker than is usual  in summ Presently a sound was heard at  the door   Minnie is that youT cried the mother   It is Polly answered a moumfiil voice as  the little girl entered the cottage   Is the baby worse J asked Mrs Wing  field   1 hope not but mother is in such a state  about Johnny if it were not for baby she  would be wandering all night in the rain I  come to ask if you could kindly give her a little  hartshorn I know that that is what you take  when you are poorly   You are heartily welcome to what I have  replied the cottager I daresay that you can  find it yourself I need not rise Snuff the  long wick of the candle and there dont put it  in the draught mind you dont snuff it out  why how your poor fingers tremble T  How changed was Polly since the mopmings  sun had risen Her cheeks pale and hazard  her eyes swollen with weeping her dress hang  ing damp around her chill form who would  have guessed that she ever could have been the  gayest girl in the village   You will find the bottle on the shelf you  can reach it with a chair continued Mrs Wing  field raising herself on one arm to wtoh the  proceedings of the girL There do you not see  just behind that mug Why what hare you  done she cried in a tone of impatience as  something came crashing upon the floor  What had she done indeed She had thrown  down Toms mug and set two little prisoners  free Yes they were firee free as the air which  they now joyously beat with their little wings  Uttering a loud hum of delight they flew round  the cottage darted to the door then drew back  afraid of the damp and at last both settled  sociably under the table to enjoy together a  nice crumb of sugar that Tom had dropped on  the floor  Oh if liberty be so sweet so precious to all  who would deprive even an insect of its birth  right Let them spread the ee wing uncon  fined and happy and let us find our pleasure  raiher in seeing them in the position for which  Providence formed and designed them than in  keeping them as captives the slaves to our will  deprived of their lifes dearest blessing  CHAPTER XII  AN UNPLEASANT JOTJRNET  MiKNiE and her brother stood at the brink of  the well and gazed with straining eyes into its  depths   Which of ns should go downl said Minnie   You need not have asked such a question  you know that you are not strong enough to  draw me up and I doubt added Tom passing  his hand along the rope I doubt that this is  strong enough to bear me  I Minnie drew one step backwards if it  should break with me she murmured   You should have thought of that before  was Toms only reply  Tom at all risks I must go I could not  sleep tonight with this horrible doubt on my  mind and you will not let me call others to  help I trust that the Almighty will take care  of mej for my only hope is in Him Help me  to get into the bucket and oh be very careful  dear Tom jou do not know how much fright  ened I am   Hold the rope firmly said her brother   and heie take this long stick to feel about in  the water when you are down Tom was ex  tremely anxious to have his own mind relieved  or heartless as he was he could hardly have  consented to let his young sister run this risk  ut there was nothing that the selfish boy  dreaded so much as that his share in Johnnys  wanderings should be known if his fearful suspi  cion were true and the poor child had indeed  perished through his folly  Minnie shook with terror as the bucket began  to descend every moment she fimcied the rope  giving way and that she should be plunged into  the water below The strange damp smell the  dim light the peculiar sound of her own voice in  that hollow confined place all added to her feel  ing of fear   Stop Tom she cried as the bucket touched  the water Tom looked down and could perceive  some one below but all indistinct and dim he  could not have recognised that it was his sister  Can you find anything 1 he whispered  kneeling down after fixing the wheel and lean  S over with his hands resting on the brink  He heard a little splashing in the water and  waited for the answer of Minnie with great  anxiety Can you find anything there 1 he  repeated  No Oh the relief brought by that one  little word   Have you searched welll said Tom have  you searched to ihe bottom   Quite to the bottom there is nothing but  water Seaven be praised said the hollow voice  from below Now draw me up again but  softly very softly Oh how thankful I shall be  if I ever reach the top f  There was not another word spoken by ther  brother or sister while Tom with painful exer  tion turned the handle of the wheel and first  Minnies clinging hands and then her frightened  face appeared above the level of the well  Tom helped her to the side which she could  not have reached by herself and then falling on  her knees the poor little girl returned her fervent  thanks to Heaven at once for Johnnys deliver  ance from the well and her own   Now let us return said Tom there is no  use in remaining here it is growing quite dark  and beginning to rain we can continue our  search in the morning   But if poor little Johnny should be some  where in this wood only think what he would  suffer left out all night it would kill him with  fright if not with the weather 1 Bememb  Tom that no one else is likely to have looked  for him here a place which he could never haVe  reached by himself  Tom muttered something between his teeth  which perhaps it was as well that Minnie did  not hear but he certainly looked around him  more carefully  Minnie had wandered a few steps from her  brother and was slowly walking round the green  sward surrounding the well a clear space whieh  was almost enclosed by the wood only open on  the side by which they had approached it and  from which two dark narrow paths scarce wide  enough to permit two persons to pass each other  led into the depths o£ the forest On a sudden  she stopped stooped down then eagerly cried  out Oh look what I have here he must be  near he must be near Tom hastened to the  spot and beheld in Minnies hand a little dusty  shoe with its strap and round black button  which both felt certain had belonged to the lost  child   Well he could not walk fax withdut his  shoe observed Tom I daresay that he is  near enough to hear me HaUoo Johnny T he  shouted halloo there was no reply but the echo   He must have gone down one of those little  paths said Minnie we had better search one  of them at once   Better search both of them as thore are two  of ua said Tom if we took but on«b we should  be sure to choose the wrong one  Poor Minnie gave a woful look at the dark  walks however tempting they might have looked  when nuts were on the boughs and the sun  beams struggled through their green shade to  the eye of the little girl they looked anything  but tempting now when approaching night was  wrapping them in deepest gloouL   Why you are not afraid cried Tom with  his rude coarse laugh for now that he was  relieved from his fear that the child was actually  dead the thought of what he might be suffering  weighed little upon his mind   If it is right for me to go alone I will go  faltered Minnie whether I am afraid or not  Tom laughed again but he had Httle cause to  laugh at words that expressed more true courage  than all the idle vaunts that he had ever uttered  He might have remembered that his sister had  just ventured upon what an older and wiser  companion than hiipself would never have suf  fered her to have attempted But having no  fear of a night walk in a lonely wood himself he  now as was ever the case with him had no oon  siderataon for the feelings of another  The brother and sister parted in the darkness  and rain Minnie trembling half with fear  half witli cold weixt eaatiouslj alcmg the gloomy  way Erery few steps she paused and softly  called Johnny T but her listening ear caught  no sound but the pattering of the rain Many  many times she stopped and almost resolved to  go back when the thought of her little rosy  cheeked friend out in the darkness and rain  frightened cold and wet encouraged her to  pursue her journey For more than an hour the  young girl wandered on when at last the wood  came to an end and she found herself alone on a  dark wide heath dotted over here and there by  furze bushes   Johnny once more ahe cried almost in  despair a sickening feeling of disappointment  coming oyer her heart Weary and sad she  could have sat down and cried She saw a little  on her left hand one lonely light which ap  peared to proceed from some cottage Here at  least she might beg for shelter and towards it  she slowly walked The light shone steady and  bright from a little window and before she  ventured to knodk at the door Minnie Wingfield  cautiously peeped in  An aged man sat with his back to the window  and a laige book open on the table before him  the very sight of which gave hope and confidence  to Minnie TTi« wife in her armchair was  listening opposite a mild calm expression on  her venenble fiioe and in the comer orouched  poor silly Saliyy ker brow no longer bound with  her cbaplet of wild flowers she had wreathed it  round the lost Johnny whom with a delight  which repaid all her fears Minnie beheld nluoi  bering in the arms of the idiot  It was this poor helpless creature who had  found the little boy clinging in terror to the  bough There was still a womans instinct left  in her breaat an instinct of tenderness towards a  child Terrified at first to behold the dreaded  Satty it was only the necessity of his case that  made poor Johnny suffer her to touch him but  kindness soon finds its way to the heart she  fondled him stroked his curly locks decked him  out with her Betvourite flowers and then carried  him away through the still greenwood to her  own little home on the common pleeaed as a  child that has found a new toy Strange that  the life whidi had been endangered by the  thoughtlessness of a eoinpanion should be guarded  by the tenderness of one bereft of reason  Minnie Wingfield soon dtered the cottage  and was received with Christian hoEitality  She was placed by the fire her dress dried and  food placed before her and her mind was re  lieved by hearing that a messenger had been  sent to her village to bear tiding» to Mrs Bright  that her Johnny was safe and under shelter  What a joyful end to all Minnies anxieties  how sweet the reward of all the painftd efforts  that she had made i  CHAPTER XIII  WUrOS AND STINGS  It is now time that I should draw my tale to a  dose but as my reader may like to know what  became of the little people with wings and  without wings that we have followed through  this story I shaU gire a few more pages to an  account of their fate  The first sunbeam which shone the next morn  ing upon the hive glittered on Silverwing as  with joyous speed she hastened back to her  home She continued there her busy and her  happy life finding sweetness everywhere honey  in each flower and cheering the less joyous  existence of Sipeyrup whose wing never quite  recovered its power As the injured bee was  unable to fly out with the next swamii her  friend remained behind to bear her company  they passed the summer days in active employ  and the winter in plenty and reposel  I have a less pleasing aoooimt to give of  Waxywill who was certainly a most wayward  bee She chose to go out honeynsieeking one day  when required for work in the hive she re  solved contrary to orders to visit the dwelling  of a humblebee and because she knew that her  cousins of that race live underground against  the warnings of her companions she entered a  little hole in a bank and found herself in the  midst of a nest of wasps Her melancholy fate  may easily be imagined she died beneath the  Btings of her enemies  But perhaps you are more desirous to hear  what befel our heroes and heroines of the human  race  Let my reader then fancy himself again be  neath the little porch which adorns the front f  Mrs Wingfields cottage It is now later in the  year the finest flowers in the garden have faded  one or two sunflowers and a few dahlias look  gay still j but the fresh feel of the morning air  the white tinge on the grass and the heavy dew  which has strung Spinaways web with number  less tiny beads show tjiat the autumn is now  advanced Beneath the porch sits Minnie busy  as usual with her work before the hour for going  to school Tom is near her engaged in stringing  iiogether little eggshells collected in the spring  pretty enough in themselves but won at the  expense of much misery to the poor birds whone  nests he had robbed  Who approftdies from the opposite side of the  lane bearing a baby carefully wrapped up in her  anus You will soaroelj recognise poor Polly  once so fond of finexy and folly How much  nicer she looks in her present quiet dress with  her gentle subdued look and kindly air  Then the baby did live Tes he did live a  poor sickly delicate child But oh the tender  ness with which he has been watched by Polly  who now seems to think that she can never do  enough for her brothers She appears to have  tlirown away her vanity with her diamond  brooch or rather she has thoroughly learned  the painful lesson taught through that terrible  evening and night The resolutions that she  then made she has not forgotten the prayers  which she then uttered were from the heart  and there is not in the whole village to be found  a more sober modest quietlydressed girl always  placing her duties before her pleasures than the  once vain selfish Polly Bright  She now drew near carrying the baby with  little Johnny trotting after her his cheeks just  as rosy and his figure as round as before his  adventure in the woods It had left on his  mind a great affection for Minnie who had al  ways been a favourite with the child and he  now ran up to his friend with an apple in his  hand as round and as rosy as himself   Minnie Wings said the little boy holding it  up to her lips Minnie Wings you take bit  Minnie smilingly accepted the proffered kind  ness of the child after stooping down to kiss his  rosy face   Oome here you little rogue said Tom in a  tone halfsurly and halfgood humoured tell  me why you call her Minnie Wings instead of  Wingfieldr   Cause said Johnny with dimpling cheeks   she fly to help me   So did I observed Tom so I suppose that  I am Wings too  Johnny fixed his round eyes full upon his  neighbour and slowly retreating backwards as if  rather afraid replied No you Tommy Stiugs  Tommy would have been angry at the speech  if he could have helped laughing at it but the  manner and look of the child halfresolute half  frightened were so irresistibly comic that Tom  my 3tings put the best face upon the matter  and appeared goodhumoured for once in his life  He was certainly in a mood more amiable than  usual having that morning been engaged to go  as an errand boy in a neighbouring town where  under the eye of a strict master we may hope  that his conduct may improve and that he may  cease to deserve the title bestowed upon him by  little Johnny   I have oome to give you good news dear  Minnie said Pollj after joining in the laugh  which her little brother had occasioned j we  have had a letter from the Crimea and my dear  father is welL   I am so glad of thatT cried Minnie who  was ever ready to rejoice with the rejoicing   And jou looked so bright when I first saw  you said Polly that I suspect that you have  some good news of your own to give me in  return   You are quite right I have famous news  dear Folly The squires lady was here late last  evening you know how kind she is She wants  to place her babys fosterbrother in some cottage  near her and to my joy has fixed upon ours   And will she pay wellT   Oh more than we could have ventured to  hope We really shall now be quite comfort   able I My mother is so much pleased I do not  think that I have seen her so well or so cheerful  ever since our great troubles last year How  good Gkd has been to us added the little girl  her eyes glistening with bright tears of gratitude  and pleasure He has always raised up friends  for us in our need   Yes Minnie and you who are a Mend to all  who require one are never likely to be in want  of a friend   I shall so enjoy having a dear little child to  look after I am sure that it will be a pleasure  rather than a trouble   It is easy to guess said Polly with a good  natured smiley why the lady chose your cottage  for the home of the baby  Johnny after two or three vain attempts had  succeeded in clambering up the bench on which  Minnie was seated She now felt his little arms  pressed round her neck as he drew her down to  wards him to whisper close in her ear Every  body happy with my Minnie Wings I  And now nothing remains but that A L O E  should bid her young readers farewelL If they  have liked her little book let them remember  that her story is but as the comb which may  be pleasant to the eye but that its moral is  the honey which is treasured within However  young however weak dear children you may be  know that the youngest the weakest have some  power here to give either pleasure or pain A  generous spirit shrinks from inflicting suffering  on the smallest insect or the feeblest worm and  I trust that no reader of my little tale will hesi  tate which part to take for his own or leave it  doubtful whether he ought to be classed under  the title of Wings or Stings
