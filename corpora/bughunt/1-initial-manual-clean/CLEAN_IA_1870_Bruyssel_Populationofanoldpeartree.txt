POPULATION OF AN OLD PEAR-TREE. 



CHAPTER I. 

INTRODUCTION. 

WHEN certain blue spirits begin .to flit 
about me, I depart from my study to go and 
read, in what I am allowed, even by my clerical 
uncle, to call my book of devotions. 

The devotions I mean are not in my book- 
case. No publisher, if he ever thought of such 
a thing, could bring them out. They are a page 
of the book of Nature, opened in the country, 
under blue sky, displayed at all seasons. Every 



one has looked at that book, but few of us under- 
stand it in any degree, and the man who could 
read it all would be the wisest in the world. 

In short, my book is a meadow lying not 
far from the town where I was born. A 
substantial farmer gets two crops of hay off it, 
and is well satisfied. 

I go there to do nothing, and am still better 
satisfied, and we are not at all in each other's 
way. 

No traveller in search of scenery has ever 
found so fair a spot as my meadow. Set within 
a frame of beautiful hills, it is like a great 
amphitheatre, the only entrance being a narrow 
cleft with a brook at the bottom. It is entirely 
enclosed by a verdant screen of ambitious shrubs. 
Unnumbered generations of primroses, periwinkles, 
violets, and lilies of the valley grow on the 
slopes. Birds make their nests there, twittering 
and singing at the top of their voices ; one 
insect chases another from flower to flower like 
fantastic sylphs; thence the bee draws her honey, 




there the hare makes her form ; my meadow is 
all jubilant with song, colour, and light. Now I 
will tell you how I was admitted into its secrets. 

One day I went out with heavy head, restless 
eye, and gloomy temper. I walked straight on, 
like a crane or a bittern, without pausing at the 
wayside attractions. Such demeanour, absurd afc 
it is, generally indicates some mental disquiet. 
The happy man, provided he be taken up with 
other thoughts, moves in curves or zigzags, nearer 
and farther, backwards and forwards, in no haste 
to be at his journey's end. I had, however, no 
reason to complain that I had trusted to the 
guidance of my star. Chance, the odours of 
spring, and a fortunate instinct, conducted me 
on that day to a splendid discovery. 

All at once I found before me a vast lawn 
clothed in green velvet, with gold and silver 
enamel. Some old trees stretched out into the 
sunshine ; stunted and knotty, they waved in the 
breeze their long limbs all covered with infant 
fruits. 

 

At sight of them the frown left my brow, 
and I began to improve. I relaxed my hurried 
pace ; I began by sitting down, and at last lay 
down at full length on the grass. I like that 
posture, for it disposes one to contemplation. 

I cried, " Oh how good it is to see no more 
houses, streets, or squares ! How I enjoy this 
sweet solitude, full of love and peace, gaining 
new charms from each dawning day ! " 

With this, my thoughts wandering in a thou- 
sand visions, the characters of past, present, and 
future, I soon came to dream that I was dreaming ; 
then softly, without effort, slipping from one 
breath to another, I slept the sleep of the just. 

Gradually I became, as it were, lulled and 
benumbed by dreamy sensations ; but I was 
startled out of this happy condition by angry 
howls, uncertain cries, and passionate exclama- 
tions resounding close to me. One voice mur- 
mured : 

" Oh, what pain I am in ! bruised all over, 
and my wing dreadfully crumpled ! If I only 




could get it out ! But no, he will not move, and 
I am kept prisoner by a bent stalk." 

Others cried, " Prick him, bite him, tear him 
with your sharp claws : he is a hideous arid 
disgusting monster ; he cannot take a single 
step without committing a crime ; his path is 
strewed with the dead and dying/' 

I immediately felt a strange tingling in all 
my limbs, but it was too slight to wake me 
entirely. It seemed as if all the pores of my 
skin were being furnished with wondrously sharp 
and piercing eyes. All my senses at once be- 
came marvellously acute. The hum of a gnat 
seemed like the sound of a trumpet, and the per- 
'fume of lilies of the valley, wafted on the breeze, 
was strong enough to intoxicate my senses. 

" Is this," I thought, " the beginning of another 
life, and have I died without finding it out 1 
After all, why should I be surprised 1 Did I 
make a note of my natal hour, the fleeting moment 
when I inhaled my first breath ? Dead or alive, 
I will be all ears and eyes." 



I now saw the face of nature under a quite 
novel aspect, from the point of view of the 
smallest members of creation. Instead of re- 
clining on a carpet of greensward, I found I 
was in an immense tangled forest made up of 
giant grasses, whose long streamers waving in the 
air were composed of a splendid tissue of green 
and gold spangled with crystal spikes. The most 
humble flowers appeared to me to be magnificent 
plants of unusual splendour. The very daisy 
close beside me had acquired a majestic grace, 
and the stalk surprised me by its dimensions. 
This stem was of a tender green colour and 
clothed with long glassy hairs, growing more close 
together at the top, forming fasces around 
the flowery crown. Among the pretty white 
petals so often used by young girls in divining 
their fortunes, where I had never before seen 
anything but the golden heart, I now perceived 
a great nosegay of yellow blossoms interspersed 
with little transparent balls, and perfectly regular. 
This is no exaggeration ; I really saw what I 




describe, remembering all the time that it is hard 
to believe. 

The very ground was changed wherever it was 
not covered with grass. The whole surface shone 
with precious stones. Every grain of sand, spark- 
ling with many colours, and darting a thousand 
fires, was worthy to be set in a sovereign's ring. 

I remembered that I had lain down at the 
foot of a pear-tree, just bursting into leaf with 
the warm breath of spring, though much injured 
by the winter's cold. I saw it again, but so 
wonderfully enlarged, that I really could not take 
it all in at once. Its bark had quite disappeared, 
giving place to a rich carpet of white, green, or 
yellow moss, in the most whimsical patterns. At 
times this verdant veil was raised by certain flat, 
bald heads, with great glaring round eyes, and 
bearing powerful hooks instead of jaws, which 
took a curious survey of me. For an instant I 
feared I should be eaten up, and then returned 
to my mind a picture of Breughel's, of the in- 
fernal regions, in which the demons are drawn 




with cloven feet and large stomachs, grinning, 
leaping, and dancing, and with a human form 
struggling among them. Eeally I did deserve a 
chastisement for my intrusion into the meadow, 
the disastrous consequences of which I now had 
power to perceive to the full extent. I had bruised 
the tender stalks of springing grass, broken quan- 
tities of buds, and destroyed myriads of living 
creatures. In my stupid simplicity I had never 
had any suspicion of the pain I caused while 
perpetrating these evil deeds, and had been in 
a state of delight at the profound peace pervading 
the country, and the charms of solitude. What 
peace, and what solitude ! 

I was beginning to pity and say disagreeable 
things to myself, the privilege of intimacy, 
when a stifled cry was forced from my lips, 
and my blood was frozen in my veins by an 
unexpected sight. A terrible creature, at the 
recollection of which I still shudder, had suddenly 
Appeared in my sight, hanging over my head like 
an acrobat on his trapeze. It was an enormous 

spider, keeping her great black eyes constantly 
fixed on mine with a most implacable expression. 
Slowly, slowly did she descend from one of the 
branches of the old Pear-Tree. 

Eeader, allow me here to break into my tale 
with the confession of one of my failings. By 
nature I have many, and am not sorry for it, 
because it is perhaps, thanks to my own faults, 
that I have become indulgent to those of others. 
I have no right to set up for rigid virtue. The 
Athenians banished Aristides because they were 
tired of hearing him called the Just ; and for my 
part, so far I have lived in peace under my own 
roof. Now, of course I am brave, but only about 
half-brave. I am able to make a valiant resist- 
ance to any attack when once hand-to-hand with 
the aggressor ; but when it is a waiting matter, 
seeing him approach gradually, holding his breath, 
and while I momentarily expect a deadly hug, 
which still comes not, at these my nerves become 
agitated, stiffen, give way, and I fall into a strange 
condition. I am not exactly afraid, but I feel as 



a hare must when just found by a pointer-dog in 
her form. Thus was I while the giant spider, full 
of savage strength and vigour, descended from 
the branches of the tree beneath which I had 
slumbered. 

The body was clothed in a kind of grey fur, 
and of a ruddy brown colour, varied by some 
marked patterns in a bright yellow. The active 
limbs, thin, sinewy, of considerable strength, were 
in incessant motion ; they were armed with claws 
like a cat's, and as hard and sharp as blades of 
steel. The mouth bore a pair of mandibles, and 
two hooks. These last implements were each ter- 
minated by a small hole, the issues of canals lead- 
ing from poison-glands full of a deadly liquid. 

I was confounded, and would have given the 
whole world to have been able to run away as fast 
as my legs would carry me ; but they refused their 
office. The spider continued to descend, turning 
and twisting in the wind, and, like a cat watching 
a mouse, stared at me and fascinated me with her 
big jet-black eyes. Strangely engrossed in spite of 



my increasing agitation, I did not miss a single 
one of her movements. The silk she hung by was 
an absolute rope, composed of a vast quantity of 
extremely fine strands, which issued from four 
conical humps she bore on her abdomen. These 
threads at first were sticky and slimy, but soon 
hardened in the air, while she united them by the 
movements of her feet. 

My fate was coming to a crisis. The monster's 
claws were not above an inch from my cheek, 
when she all at once stopped and climbed up hei 
rope with great rapidity. 

I was safe ! Above me, in an immensely 
strong web, which reminded me of the great nets 
our fishermen use, was struggling a black fly, with 
great masses of eyes, arranged like the facets of a 
precious stone on each side of his head, his throat 
and body glittering in the sun as if clothed in 
fine burnished Milan steel. On his back was a 
yellowish moving spot, which really was a parasitic 
insect. This strange rider, foreseeing a catastrophe 
by the instinct peculiar to creatures of his kind, 



was hastily disentangling the two grapplers that 
secured his hold on his victim, and arranging his 
retreat. He was flat and hideous, with long suckers, 
and a body puffed out with blood. 

Poor fly ! It looked so wretched that I almost 
thought its expression human. I had already 
witnessed similar scenes in my native town. Is it 
not thus that the artist, with his love of the 
beautiful, intoxicated with independence, generous 
even to prodigality, falls into the nets of Shylock 
the money-lender, a crawling v/retch, who lives 
by trickery, and watches in the shade for his 
prey? Poor artist! Indignant at having fallen 
under such a yoke, he exhausts his strength in 
futile resistance ! Even so was it with the fly. 
Caught by one wing it struggled frantically. 
There is always some hope, even in the most 
desperate case. 

It is matter, I thought, for rejoicing, that we 
are all ignorant, both men and beasts, of the 
secret of our fate. Great Heaven ! what a life 
should we lead could we guess the riddle of this 



sphinx, immoveable guardian of the shrine! And 
really is not the work hard and harvest scanty 
for a great proportion of us ? Many germs are 
blighted, or do not reach maturity, and many a 
spring is dried up before its silver thread can 
mingle with the great waves of the blue ocean. 
The fly had nearly regained freedom. The 
network around it was yielding on all sides, when 
the spider rushed upon it, and strained it in a 
close embrace. The captive repulsed her, stif- 
fening all its limbs to the utmost, but, sad to 
relate, not in time to avoid a savage wound, filled 
with poisonous juice ; and, thus paralysed, its cou- 
rage was all in vain. The spider, crushing down 
a final throe of life, turned it round and round, 
smeared it with sticky slime, covered it with 
threads, and began to devour it. Meanwhile the 
abject parasite I have before mentioned had let 
itself fall on the ground, and with difficulty dragged 
itself along the sand a short distance from me. 
Certainly the little abortion was not without dex- 
terity. It was of those who survive all disasters, 





pass uninjured through all 

find a niche to rest in somewhere. It all depends 

on constitution. 

I had been greatly excited by these scenes, 
and remained asleep, my head in shade, and feet 
in sunshine. Had my dream lasted minutes, 
hours, or days ? I had no knowledge of time, 
and murmured with my lips : 

" The book of creation is hard to read, and 
at times there is much pain in learning its lessons. 
The whole is contained in every individual thing ! 
The range of our view is bounded by infinity. 
This lowest parasite, fallen from, a fly's wing, 
perhaps had his own vermin preying on himself. 
In space there is star beyond star ; on earth one 
atom is lost in another atom." 

I stopped, confounded by this overwhelming 
thought ; here began my initiation. The cha- 
racter of the meadow had changed, and I thence- 
forward called it my book of devotion. 



MY astonishment had already been excited 
by the vast bulk of the old tree at whose feet 
I had seated myself, and I continued to gaze 
upon it. Firmly anchored in the ground, with 
penetrating powerful roots, and bravely raising its 
splendid trunk with a crown of multitudinous 
branches to the sky, through which it projected 
a wide and deep shadow penetrated by many 
brilliant lights, around it had perished myriads 
of beings benumbed by the approach of cold, 
exhausted by famine and misery ; while it, always 
sound and vigorous, clothed itself with returning 



spring with a fresh vesture. Eain, hail, and storm 
destroying legions of living atoms, could hardly 
bend its head. An unmoved witness, it took its 
part in the many pageants of my meadow's 

stage. 




Envy could not begrudge a princely state to 
this old patrician ; for so it seemed by nature. 
The old Pear-Tree was gentle and kind to the 
weak, like a nobleman come of a good stock. The 



farmer's children climbed the branches yearly, and 
thence gathered a quantity of fine ripe fruit ; 
while wasps and caterpillars took their share. 
Here and there young twigs might be cut away, 
but these slight thefts were of no consequence. 
Does the owner of a great landed property, the 
accumulation of many years, with secure title- 
deeds, trouble himself for the vile pilfering of 
some petty bailiff? He deigns not to interfere, 
although aware of what is going on. Examples 
of all sorts are found in this world, from the 
oak scattering its acorns in the forest, down to 
the animal that searches for them in the mud. 
Ducklings hasten into the water, while chickens 
dare not quit the bank ; each does according to 
its own particular nature. 

Our tree, full of rich sap, had more clients 
than a Roman senator. And first, there lived 
in the folds of the bark a curious race very 
homely, without much elegance, but very lively. 
It was a tribe of woodlice, of all ages, and different 
shapes and colours. Young or old, they looked 






quite unpleasant enough, and I should not have 
liked to see them march towards me. Their bodies, 
all of a size, were composed of ten rings, or plates, 
of an ash colour. I could make out with some 
difficulty a little dusky head in front of the 
foremost, bearing two bending and very active 
antennae. 




They went and came, biting and gnawing all 
sorts of rubbish, and even making attacks on 
the still tender stalks of newly budding plants. 
Did any one of them suffer from any accident, 
the whole party rushed on him, and made a 
meal on his carcase. Is not this too often the 
fate of those who fail, men or beasts ? How 
much better is it to dismember a motionless body, 



like the woodlice, than to fatten on the reputation 
of an honest man. But not to moralize too 
much. 

My woodlice, like some politicians, clever people 
otherwise, often put on a new coat, withdrawing 
carefully from their old shell body, legs, and 
horns. They were of all shades, according to their 
age from pale grey to dark grey, spotted with 
black spots, and little yellow. The females bore 
a little bag of a thin transparent skin, in which 
were enclosed their progeny. 

I was watching them running through the 
moss, when a sharp metallic sound recalled me to 
other scenes. I thought a little silver bell had 
been rung near the mouth of a dark cavern, 
opening in a slope, about two steps off. The 
sound was repeated louder, and I saw appear 
a long head, with four great thick appendages, as 
well as two antennae as fine as threads. Behind 
these antennae were placed two great eyes; between 
them were seen three others smaller, placed in 
the same transverse line. 




As the new-comer emerged from the darkness, 
she displayed two enormous legs, very strong and 
flat, enlarged towards the ends, and terminating 
in six claws, like the teeth of a saw, four turning 
outwards and two inwards. On her breast was 




a long soit of cuirass, almost circular, and covered 
with velvet ; on her back were two short cases, 
laid across and partly hiding two great wings 
folded to a point. 

I at once knew her, from having in my youth 



hunted her, and often unsuccessfully ; it was the 
mole-cricket. 

The insect advanced slowly, ready to return 
to her cave on the least alarm. Living alone she 
had become restless and suspicious, like all those 
who avoid company. Terrified where there was no 
danger, she was only happy in the dark, hanging 
to the feeding roots of some plant, or attacking 
with blows of her claws a wretched earth-worm 
too lazy to escape. 

Why had this misanthrope left her peaceful, 
safe harbour to venture herself into the meadow ? 

The silver bell tinkled on, and its shrill note 
mingled with the sound of the wind among the 
leaves. The mole-cricket heard it with a shudder, 
stopped in uncertainty, and then resumed her 
march, guided by a mysterious power that she 
hardly tried to resist. Was it magnetism, or 
fascination, or combined of both ? A little of it, 
and something more ; for the silver sounds that 
rang around the strange creature were her 
' wedding-bells. Her cruel nature could only be 



softened by spring, with its warm air and 
opening flowers. 

At any other season, very far from greeting 
favourably the elegant gentleman who was now 
tinkling at his own door, she would have rushed ; 
at him and torn his face. To-day, not so warlike, 
almost mild, she passed to the nuptial meeting. 

As the spouses drew nearer, the silver bell 
rang less loudly and more airily. The motions of 
the wings of the male, violent of late, which 
produced this curious sound, grew feebler by 
degrees. He was hid under the grass, and my 
mole-cricket too disappeared there. I heard two 
or three more indistinct and plaintive notes, and 
then the meadow was 'quite quiet. 

At this moment my sensations were indescri- 
bable. Proud of the wonderful perfection of my 
eyesight, and Bearing, rejoicing in these new 
faculties, I wondered how I could ever have lived 
so long nearly blind and half deaf. - Nothing 
now escaped my notice, and all nature found a 
reflection in me, with an especial clearness and 



precision. I was in a state of beatitude, some- 
times felt, but seldom when in perfect health. I 
was alive, and thought, and yet did not feel my 
body any longer. Pain or pleasure was not felt 
in it, as I wandered like a spirit through the 
regions of dream and fancy. Again the grass 
was disturbed, and the mole-cricket returned 
towards me, thrusting itself through the grass, 
and making its way towards the slope of ground. 
When she got a few inches away from her former 
mansion, she extended her great palms and began 
to scratch the earth. Soon an excavation was 
made, lengthened into a perpendicular shaft, then 
turned towards the left at a slight slope. The 
work was done quickly and energetically. 

When this first operation was complete, the 
insect set to work to burrow horizontally, and 
made a small oval chamber, carefully smoothing 
its walls. This was not far under ground, 
between two great roots of the Pear-Tree, and 
not beyond the influence of the heat of the sun. 
There, believing herself secure from interruption, 



the mole-cricket laid about a hundred eggs, 
almost transparent, gelatinous, and of a greenish 
tint. Burial was not enough ; they must be pro- 
tected from marauders. This was provided by the 
careful mother making fortifications round them, in- 
trenchments, ramparts, and covered ways. Satisfied 
with her work, she took post as sentry not far off, 
ready, at the least alarm, to come to the rescue. 

A number of very busy ants were always 
passing, to and fro on the trunk of the old Pear- 
Tree, mounting to the first branches and coming 
down again, for ever repeating the same evolutions. 
I watched one in particular, climbing among the 
lichens and mosses, and searching everywhere with 
its antennae, using them indeed as feelers. At a 
certain height she stopped at once before a kind 
of whitish shell, half hidden between two bite of 
bark. She went round it, and felt it all over, 
pressed it between her paws, and gnawed at it 
in a fever of impatience. 

We will shortly give the history of this egg 
so greedily sought for. 





If an idler had stopped under our old Pear- 
Tree in the first months of summer, he might 
have remarked a sort of woodlouse of liliputian 
dimensions, moving under the leaves and on the 
twigs of the plant ; it had two horns, six feet, 
and a body composed of six rings, and was powdery 
all over. This individual had among othei 
peculiarities an impossible mouth, situated on its 
chest between the first pair of legs. It was 
composed of a sort of hillock or pipe of flesh, 
very short, and proceeding from it a very long 
thin white thread. By this pipe does the little 
creature take its nourishment, thrusting it deeply 
into the vegetable tissues. Our false woodlouse 
with a Greek name, aphis, after wandering some 
time free and happy, settled down, and placed 
itself in a well-sheltered spot. There it remained 
motionless, tired of adventures, without leaving 
the spot. Those limbs, lately so supple, grew stiff 
for want of employment, and at last their use 
was lost. At the end of winter it would have 
perished without sign of life or movement if 




plucked from its retreat. Once fixed, it had 
become larger and stronger, and grown to the 
size of a small bean. As the skin stretched, the 
wrinkles disappeared, and the aphis became n 
slightly oblong lump. 

Our wretched insect thus entered on the last 
stage of its existence. One day this half dead, 
oblong lump began to lay eggs; and as these, 
passing under it, were collected beneath, the shell 
which served them as a wrapper covered them. 
At last it made the plunge from life to death, 
having outlasted the male with his light trans- 
parent wings. 

Then this white shell, hanging between two 
pieces of bark, was the cradle of a generation. 
No wonder now at the excitement of the greedy 
ant at discovering this treasure. Inside were 
many eggs of a reddish colour, hard and shining, 
protected from the cold by a coverlet, like cotton, 
of a white sticky powder. The robber was hard 
at work with her mandibles, . when one of her 
own kind, likewise on quest since morning, all at 





once appeared, and made one spring towards the 
aphis. 

Between the disputants ensued a long discourse ; 
they angrily rubbed their horns against each other, 
clearly remonstrating with one another. At last 
victory declared for the right of the first comer, 
but not -without a violent debate : while the 
intruder yielded unwillingly, without giving up a 
pleasant hope of future fortune, were it no better 
than the gleanings of another's field. Eetiriug a 
couple of inches from the shell, she turned her 
head away with so sad and confused an air that 
I could not help repeating Pliny's words : " In 
formicd non modo sensus sed etiam mens, ratio, 
memoria" That is to say, he attributes to my 
ant mind, reasoning power, and memory. This 
scene was often repeated, and soon around the 
aphis was gathered a ring of anxious -watchers, 
while in the centre the first-comer reigned with 
unrivalled grandeur. She had possession, and 
made a brave defiance to the opposition, with 
fierce gestures of her mandibles, eyes flaming, and 


eloquent antennae. All this was very much like 
parliament, I do assure you, and I fancied I heard 
her say, like one great minister of times gone by 
. . . but just at present I cannot remember his 
speech. Besides, I never understood anything in 
politics, except that it is a science that all the 
world lays claim to knowing, without the trouble 
of learning. I can only answer for one thing, 
that our ant proved to her own satisfaction the 
goodness of her cause, but without convincing her 
antagonists that they were in the wrong. 

Do not those who are lucky enough to be 
formed in the great school of life act much in 
this way, with more or less of talent than the 
victorious ant ? 



CHAPTER III. 

A TRAGEDY IN THE GRASS. 

NEXT came a cockchafer, big, heavy, and 
rough-footed, tumbling about like a comfortable 
citizen who has stayed too long at the public- 
house, and is going home a good deal too late, 
and pretty well scared at being alone. He took 
long steps but did not get on much, for he was 
blinded by the sunlight, and his great tail dragged 
in the sand. At first sight one would have thought 
that he had been feasting too deeply on "the 
branches of the old Pear-Tree, and that some 
drops of dew had disturbed his brain. Yet this 
idea would have been very incorrect ; for in truth 



the poor creature was only dazzled, and certainly 
so might any one have been in his place, for he 
had just made his entrance into the world. 

Four years before, on a fine June evening, 
his mother had dug a trench in the ground at 
the foot of the great tree, and laid some oblong 
eggs in it of a pale yellow colour. When she had 
satisfactorily accomplished this, returning above 
ground she inhaled the balmy breaths of air in 
a melancholy mood ; arid after having spent a 
few days on a leafy branch, at last fell from it 
and died amid the stalks of a forget-me-not. 

She had laid her eggs side by side ; and as 
time went by, and they felt the reviving in- 
fluences of spring, they gradually changed their 
colour. At last thence issued certain six-footed 
white larvae, and among them our cockchafer, 
then only a humble worm a kind of false cater- 
pillar with five rings. His head was scaly, hard, 
and rather brown ; there were two great eyes in 
it, and it had strong jaws, finished off by a pair 
of short antennae. 


Almost with his first breath of life began 
sharp twinges in the region of the stomach, and 
lie set ravenously to work, with a fierce burning, 
insatiable appetite. He grew and changed his 




skin while feeding on savoury roots ; careless 
of what might happen around him, so long as 
he was continually devouring. 


There are such beings, whose heart and brain 
are only other forms of the intestinal canal. 
Speak not to them of art or science, of litera- 
ture or questions of religion ; they neither under- 
stand, nor know, nor hear anything of them ; 
they only eat. 

Thus our larva had gone on eating, and 
eating to the best of his power, everything he 
met with for many months. But his appetite 
relaxed its tyranny as the fourth year drew to 
its close. Then changing his views, he looked 
forth, and was sensible of ambition. In prepa- 
ration for a change, he penetrated deep beneath 
the ground, and there constructed a smooth and 
polished chamber remote from curious glances. 
There he remained torpid until the month of 
February, having once more cast his vulgar skin 
and. changed into a chrysalis, and waked at last 
into a cockchafer, but a soft and white cockchafer. 

The different parts of his body gradually 
gained hardness and strength, and he issued 
from his cell, a joyous insect, but withal some- 




what clumsily, like a countryfied gentleman in 
new clothes mixing among persons of rank. 

Behold him marching forth in public, stretch- 




ing his legs with the airs of a provincial dandy 
freshly launched upon the town. He is in haste, 
after his long sojourn in the dark, to enjoy the 




verdure as it sparkles in the dew. But there is 
a stumbling-block in his way, and he stops in 
surprise. His path is barred by a rock, possibly 
only a pebble. Anybody but a cockchafer would 
go round ; but ours is an enterprising hero, and 
would attempt an escalade. The first attempts at 
first are unsuccessful, for the surface of the stone 
is as smooth as glass. He perseveres, waves his 
great arms in despair, raises himself heavily, and 
after balancing a moment in the air, his head 
turns, and he rolls on his back in the dust, 
abashed and astonished, bruised all over by his 
fall. 

Never, no, never has such a rebuff fallen 
under my notice. Can you imagine the feelings 
of a bachelor of arts finding that there is more 
left for him to learn 1 Have you probed the sen- 
sations of a would-be member, cast back upon 
common life from dreams of becoming the creator 
of his country's happiness by consulting his own? 

These disappointments, these troubles, these 
rebuffs were quite a bed of roses compared to 



what one poor sheath-winged friend appeared to 
feel. To mark his entrance into the world, after 
three years spent in devouring with feverish 
haste, after a most artistic change into a chry- 
salis, and bearing a multitude of privations for 







u whole winter, by such an astounding somer- 
sault, it was sad and heart-breaking ; and yet 
what is more common, among insects at least ? 
In climbing the mountain too many pebbles of the 
plain are to be met with, and more cockchafers 
than one encounter that hard fate. 



However that may be, the poor creature 
struggled in vain to get up. Whilst he lay on 
the sand, crushed into despair, the grass was 
disturbed a short distance from where he lay, 
and made visible a magnificent beetle, with head 
and breast of a splendid golden green, of the 
most brilliant lustre. The wing-cases were 
channelled by three large furrows, and rose in 
an elevated form. The furrows between the 
ridges were more brilliant than the edges of the 
wing-cases, and the corselet was heart-shaped. 
The eyes were brown, antennae and feet fawn- 
coloured, and abdomen greenish black with slightly 
gilded specks. 

It was easy to see that here was a somewhat 
important personage ; an old acquaintance of 
the illustrious Linnaeus, who had conferred on 
him the title of Carabus viridis, whom the 
profane call by the more familiar name of 
predatory beetle.

He too, as well as our miserable cockchafer, 



traced his growth from a larva ; but what a larva 
it was ! Long, round, soft, white, with six scaly 
feet. There was armour on the back of his head 
a round plate of a brown colour, a sort of 
natural buckler and in front of it a greedy mouth 
furnished with two strong jaws. He never lived 
on roots, but on raw and bleeding flesh. To 
obtain this choice nourishment recourse was had 
to deception, and he dug a pitfall, with his own 
head for the lid of it. Anything that passed 
over this moveable surface could not help falling 
into the gulf, where it was torn to pieces by 
teeth and claws. 

One of his relations, the larva of the square 
gold predatory beetle (Cardbus amatus), does the 
same with less trouble. He just places himself 
in a nest of processionary caterpillars, and eats 
them up at leisure. 

Our predatory beetle, on assuming his final 
shape, had not altered his manners. Not only 
was he always clad in complete armour for war, 
but even had received from nature a new weapon 



of offence, being provided with an acrid, burning 
liquor that he could cast upon his foes; a real 
insect of prey, Living by rapine and destruction, 
active, alert, and vigorous, full of courage and 
ferocity. 

The moment that he set eyes on the still 
prostrate cockchafer, he rushed on it with incon- 
ceivable nimbleness, dug his claw into its body, 
and, horrible to relate, was devouring it like a 
ferocious tiger. I felt a great desire to crush 
him with a stone, and make an application of the 
law of retribution. But what could I do as I lay 
torpid ? Was not my own life in danger ? True, 
I had been a man, and as such one of the lords 
of creation ; but was I so still ? All was altered 
around me, and my ideas were not so very clear. 
Had I any right to kill this creature I, whose 
neighbours raise sheep and oxen, cherish these 
animals, feed and pet them, to end by cutting 
their throats or breaking their heads with a pole- 



axe ? 



The cockchafer was at the point of death ; his 





feet only moved feebly. Why, destitute of beak 
and claws, was lie rash enough to enter a world 
unfit for him ? Why had he scorned the humble 
lot of larvae, to mix with the aristocrats, to 
whom he was fated to fall a victim ? The 
Carabus, his head buried in the bleeding body, 
smeared with the sap of life, enjoyed his piece 
of luck, when one of my little ants on a 
foraging expedition appeared on the scene of 
slaughter. Instantly, with wonderful perception, 
she understood the scene. She rose on her fore- 
feet, raised her antennae in astonishment, lowered 
them, and slipped through the grass in haste 
towards the scene of conflict. 

What was she going to do 1 Did she desire, 
like a jackal], to gather up the crumbs of this 
lion's feast ? Was she not rash in venturing so 
near the high and mighty Carabus Viridis ? 

I followed all her movements with the great- 
est curiosity. She drew near the pre-occupied 
Carabus, made a circuit round him, climbed on 
his back, and furiously attacking him at the 



chink of his armour between head and corselet 
made him let go his prey. The Carabus, enraged 
at this sudden assault, made violent efforts to get 
rid of his enemy ; but she clung tight, and 
grievously vexed him with bites. At last he 
became alarmed, made a furious bound, left 
his victim, and rushed into a thicket, quite weary 
and out of breath. This was doubtless just 
what the ant wanted ; for, slipping down along 
her adversary's wing-covers, she set herself to 
watch. 

This scene had passed so quickly that I had 
hardly time to consider it. The ant remained 
motionless, raising her fore-feet in a vigilant 
attitude. 

I soon saw why. Lord Carabus Viridis, 
astounded only for the moment by the violent 
assault he had suffered from, had ceased to 
retreat, and returned to the charge. No one, 
however great a philosopher he may be, will- 
ingly gives up a good meal, especially if he has 
been up with the dawn, and has not yet had 



his breakfast. He looked in doubt from right to 
left, saw nothing suspicious, and sprang back to 
his place by the cockchafer. 

The ant was on the look-out for him. Swift 
as lightning she fastened on him again, found a 
new way through the joints of his armour, and 
pricked him so sharply that he shrank with pain, 
and in his turn rolled on the ground. Rising 
painfully, conquered, disgraced, completely out of 
sorts, he scampered off at his best pace, this time 
with no notion of returning. 

The ant remained victorious on the field of 
battle. 

" In formica non tnodo sensus, sed etiam 
mens, ratio, memorial Mind had triumphed over 
brute force. 

" Brave and honoured ant ! " I cried in trans- 
port ; " she has a noble heart, whatever the grass- 
hopper may say. There she comes, like the 
knight-errant of song, to succour the feeble arid 
oppressed. This burning sympathy for the suf- 
ferer, this active and devoted charity, implies 



generous and lofty sentiments. May Heaven 
confound detractors ! " 

Alas ! my enthusiasm did not last long. My 
ant was of the positivist school, and thought of 
nothing less than the glory of a generous action. 
When she found herself alone, she came softly 
and steadily up to the cockchafer and set to 
work on him with a good appetite. When she 
found she had eaten enough, her journey was 




resumed ; till meeting another of her kind, she 
immediately made a communication to her by the 
contact of antennae. The new-comer too at once 
retraced her steps, while the first calmly resumed 



her place by the body. A moment later I saw 
a quantity of ants arrive from all the paths traced 
round the blades of grass in hastening waves, 
marching fiercely, like a division on an expedition. 
The cockchafer was soon covered with them, so 
that I could hard]y see him. They minced him 
up, they crumbled him to bits, and in a few 
moments nothing was left of the poor w r retch but 
a pair of horny wings, some braised legs, and his 
corselet half buried in the sand. "Sic transit 
gloria mundi ! " All is dust and will return to 
dust. Will the cockchafer grubs take warning by 
the sad fate of one of them ? will they live for the 
future in a more retired manner, taking thought 
that if obscurity is less joyful than broad day, 
it affords also greater safety ? In a word, will they 
be wiser than most ' men 'I None can tell. 




CHAPTER IT. 



SUBTERRANEAN CITIES. 

NOTHING conduces to meditation so much as 
silence, and all sound had died away around me. 
So I reflected on the late events, and the result 
was that I all at once cried out, running the 
risk of rousing the surrounding echoes : 

" Of all the creatures that fly in the air, 
Swim in the sea, or tread earth so fair, 
From Paris and Rome to Peru and Japan, 
The most foolish beast, as I think, is man." 

The lines are Boileau's, but I applied them to 
myself, and had good reason for putting faith 
in them. 



"What!"! went on, "did I indeed find fault 
with a foolish caterpillar, because it was disturbed 
with a notion of rising in life in obedience to 
the instinct of improving its condition ? Am I 
no longer an ardent disciple of the great mindn 
who have proclaimed the doctrine of continual 
progress, and must I take my place among the 
company of meditative admirers of routine ? " 

Taking everything into consideration, our cock- 
chafer had made only one mistake, and that de- 
stroyed him, he went away from his kind. The 
eagle, the lion, the tiger, live alone enfolded in 
their own fierce royalty, but this condition only 
suits peculiar natures. Little creatures should 
assemble and increase their power by combina- 
tion. Divided, they fall a prey to the strong ; 
yet, united, their power is invincible. Hercules, 
the conqueror of the Erymanthian boar, would 
have been put to flight by a legion of ants. 

As we are on the subject of ants, let us pay 
them a-, visit and endeavour to penetrate some of 
their secrets. Our friends of the great Pear-Tree, 




as we have before pointed out, were of the black 
race. Their city was placed at the edge of a 
path, about two yards from the tree. 

They had then made excavations and dug 
long galleries underground, sustaining the roof 
by employing roots as pillars. The walls of 
their habitation were quite smooth and perfectly 
regular. 

When once our ants were under ground they 
penetrated more deeply into the earth, and 
added a second and third story to their abode. 
Precautions had to be taken against everything 
the cold of winter, the increase of population, 
and the damage that might be caused by tor- 
rents of rain. Such a building as theirs, so 
solidly supported, presented great advantages for 
withstanding such calamities. 

Most irreproachable order reigned in the colony 
that we are describing. Labour was held in high 
esteem, and each one who took his share always 
in turn applied himself to the public good. The 
needs of the society were supplied by hunting, 






and, contrary to the generally-received opinion, 
no provision was made for winter. The workers 
or neuters that is to say, the most active mem- 




bers of the tribe issued at daybreak to attack 
anything eatable. Fruits, seeds, dead animals, 
nothing came amiss to them. At times, as we 



have seen, they fell upon a living insect, and 
tried to take possession of it. If they did not 
find that they were strong enough to do what 
they wanted, they sent to seek for assistance, 
and their victim was soon brought down, yielding 
to force of numbers and unable to escape them. 
The enemy, eager for his destruction, not only 
employed their mandibles like crowbars and pin- 
cers, but also an acrid irritating liqutr, called by 
chemists formic acid, which has a most violent 
poisonous action. 

With the approach of cold our ants retire 
into their galleries, and close the mouths of them 
with great care. Then collecting in their larger 
chambers, heaped close on each other, they fall 
into a deep torpor. What would be the use in 
collecting provisions they would not know what 
to do with ? They have no need of them, and 
await in their subterranean palace the return of a 
more mild and genial season. 

Is not the story of the Sleeping Beauty in 
the Wood, so charming in its simple grace, a 



leaf borrowed from my book ? Good heavens ! 
what are we coming to if the fairy tales, to which 
envious pedants of our day object on the pre- 
text that they hinder children of two years old 
from taking a fancy to mathematics, are be- 
coming realities ? 

The workers are not devoted to the chase 
alone. A great number of them, less warlike 
but not less useful, have other cares. Before 
we speak of these, in order better to understand 
their importance, let us make another descent 
into their city, as we have only yet studied its 
borders. 

In some tolerably spacious chambers we see 
a crowd of eggs piled close together. They are 
of different shapes and colours. The smallest 
are round, white, and opaque ; the larger are more 
transparent, and have one end slightly curved. 
Others, of medium size, are semi-opaque, and a 
sort of white cloud is visible within, longer or 


shorter. Around these watch with anxiety and 
(are the workers we have alluded to. Standing 



high on their fore-feet, there they are ready to 
defend their charge. Some are engaged in open- 
ing the entries and kneading the ground, while 
others remain inactive. If the sun lights up the 
outside of the nest, the sentinels placed outside 
nastily descend to the bottom of the habitation, 
strike their comrades with their antennae, seize 
on those who seem not to understand them, 
and drag them to the top. 

Soon the whole is in commotion. The larvae 
and nymphae that spring from the eggs before- 
mentioned are borne with all haste to the sur- 
face of the ant-hill to receive the rays of the 
sun. After an interval they are returned to 
chambers where there is a warm temperature, 
but where they are protected from too glaring 
light. When the star of day is veiled with 
clouds, or sinks beneath the horizon, the larvae are 
gathered up again and conveyed to the galleries. 

The larva of the black ant is like a little 
worm with black feet, fat, short, and conical. 
The body tapers and bends towards the fore- 



part, and is composed of a scaly head and 
twelve rings. The mouth presents two hooks, 
above which are seen four little points, two on 
each side, besides a little round protuberance by 
which the creature receives his portion. The 
workers give it to him every day, and there is 
nothing more curious than to see the young 
larvse reaching out with difficulty, and trying to 
draw near to their nurse in order to receive 
from her mandibles the nourishing fluid she 
has prepared for them. 

Such care must necessarily produce excellent 
results. The larvae having become large and fat, 
end by refusing all nourishment, and spin them- 
selves a shell of silk of a close texture, very 
smooth, round, and pale yellow. Beneath the 
protection of this elegant case they tear off their 
skin, and afterwards appear in all points^ like the 
perfect insect. But their limbs are still weak 
and delicate, and would be incapable of exertion. 
They remain motionless, pass from white to pale 
yellow, then to russet, and in some species 



brown or nearly black. This is the moment 
awaited by the workers. They then approach, 
and with their mandibles make a cleft in the 
shell and divide it from top to bottom. They 

remove the satin pellicle that envelopes our little 
mummy, pull out its benumbed feet, support, 
encourage it, and teach it the way through all 
the labyrinths of the nest. 

The power of the tribe, already on a firm 
basis, becomes freshly developed. Some brilliant 
black flies, with their delicate wings in continual 
motion, make their appearance among the workers. 
These are the male and female population of the 
colony, which must some day face abroad, and 
go to establish new families at a distance. 

These winged ants, issuing from darkness, born 
under ground, appear to have some presage of 
their future destiny. They are anxious and rest- 
less, searching for an issue to the light, blue sky, 
and wide open space that they feel must exist. 
They take but little interest in what passes around 
them ; their hopes direct them to another life. 




How much to be pitied would they be were they 
endowed with such instincts in human society ! 

People would say to them, "Why do you 
weary us with your senseless desires, your wishes, 
your doubts, and compel us to think of a lot of 
things we have nothing to do with ? Submit to 
the common lot of labour, and give up these 
foolish fancies." 

These are wise counsels, and yet what would 
become of the ant-hill unless some of these winged 
creatures were born there from time to time ? 
What would society be did not some adventurous 
and rash individuals occasionally quit the beaten 
track that leads to security, and make excursions 
over hill and dale at the risk of falling into a 
quagmire ? The footpath is the predecessor of a 
main road, and it is very necessary for some one 
first to trace it out if one is not to go for ever 
in one unvarying circle. I think- 
But what events are passing in our under- 
ground city ? The winged ants, in ever-increasing 
numbers, advance in crowds towards the different 



exits, endeavouring to escape from the ant-hill. 
The workers resist, clinging to them, and en- 
deavouring to retain them by force. It seems as 
if every grain of sand were changed into a living 
black mass, and to join in the struggle. Nothing 
can be seen in the dim light but bodies entangled, 
heads armed with mandibles, and the glancing of 




transparent wings. The disturbance extends, be- 
comes general, and ascends to the surface of the 
ground. 

Beautiful and poetical allegories have been 
made about this annual departure, with all its 
touching varied incidents. 




Often has it been said, "Do not these winged 
airy beings, so eager to be independent, and desirous 
of pleasure, represent joyous and thoughtless youth ? 
And are not these workers, faithful and devoted, 
taught so much by pain and labour, the living re- 
presentation of experience and good sense ? Trem- 
bling for those they love, they would still detain 
them, provide them against impending danger, and 
show them that together with liberty arises indi- 
vidual responsibility, increasing in like proportion. 
They are no longer listened to ; the flood swells, 
rises, and will soon burst the dykes." 

This idea is elegant, but not correct. If the 
neuter ants are full of sense, they have not the 
futile wisdom of the schoolmaster in La Fontaine, 
who made a long discourse to the drowning boy 
instead of lending him a helping hand. They 
understand the impatient burning desires of their 
winged companions, and only temporarily oppose 
their migration in order to ensure its success. If 
a ray of the sun appears, a clear warm sky, or 
a fine day, the barriers are removed, the gates 



opened, and the whole band impatiently rising at 
once, fly in clouds into the air. 

Our ants have obtained their freedom, and 
wander joyfully in space. Does not the young 
girl at her first ball feel as if she were in ethereal 
realms of poetry ? Does she wish to know what 
happens to the insect, small though it be, attired 
like her for the great summer season ? 

The ants flit backwards and forwards, charmed 
with their emancipation, and happy in the act of 
living. Each seeks for one to love, and thus they 
meet at last in a blaze of light beneath the blue 
sky, amid the harmony of nature. Then they stop 
in their rapid flight, shake their wings, and 
find them useless. Of what further service would 
they be except to fly from happiness ? A bride, 
a wife, a mother, must dream no longer ! such is 
our ant's opinion ! 

Why should they have wrings when stationary 
for ever ? Our insects resolutely make the sacrifice, 
and tear them off by waving them, so as to weaken 
the muscles which unite them to the corselet, and 



inching them off with their legs. Thus they are 
uin upon the ground, walking with difficulty 
amoW the leaves, and prepared to struggle with 
the realities of life. 

While they had wings their only thought was 
pleasure. Their duties on touching the earth 
become higher, nobler, and purer ; they have to 
perpetuate their race. 

If their wayward flight has not led them too 
far from their native ant-hill, the workers at once 
Assemble round them, to cherish, protect, and con- 
duct them back to the galleries, where they be- 
come real objects of worship, for maternity makes 
them sacred. They are 'overwhelmed with atten- 
tions, and even carried from one place to another. 
The body of the female is hooked up and sus- 
pended from the mandibles of her bearer, and 
rolled like a butterfly's trunk. It is twisted so 
well under the corselet of the worker as 'not to 
inconvenience its motions. At times they think 
it enough to drag her ; but if the ant entrusted 
with this burthen becomes weary, another takes 



the place, and the moment she is thus laid down 
the female is surrounded by her court, all showing 
their affection. The eggs as soon as produced 
are gathered and brought together round the 
mother. 

Such is the lot of the most fortunate ; but 
the wind bears others far away from their native 
spot, and they find they are left to their own 
resources ; but, stimulated by maternal affection, 
they do not recoil from the arduous task imposed 
on them. Alone, without helpers, they make 
abodes for themselves, lay their eggs, then watch 
over them, and bring up the larvae. 

The attachment of worker ants for their females 
appears to extend beyond their existence. When a 
mother dies, five or six of her followers remain 
near her, brush or lick her without ceasing for 
several days, and seem as if they wished to raise 
her again to life by thus attending on her. 

Such was the political economy of the society 
of black ants established at the foot of our great 
Pear-Tree. We have seen how they construct their 



habitations, bring up their families, and perpetuate 
their race. 

To complete this study and make it more in- 
teresting, we will collect in a subsequent chapter 
some details on other tribes of ants, whose works 
are most curious. Some of them too live in my 
meadow, and their habits bring them likewise 
round the great tree. Thence arise terrible com- 
bats, bloody encounters, and fields covered with 
dead and wounded. What a strange business it 
is ! At times the ants themselves declare war 
upon one another, for it is not the nations of mer 
alone who have their victories or suffer defeats. 


CHAPTER V. 

AN EXCURSION INTO THE HYMENOPTEROUS WORLD. 

.ONE fine summer day when I was just sixteen, 
I took ifc into my head to produce a masterpiece. 
Sixteen is the era of such plans ; but they are 
more easily conceived than executed, although 
they may be fair in the germ. They generally 
come into the world with such grave faults of 
construction, that they are at last found to be 
hardly substantial enough to arrive at full age. 
At any rate I seized my pen at once, for I had 
no doubts of myself nor of others, and I wrote 
a very fanciful poem, in which all created beings 
flung themselves into a Bacchanalian ecstasy. In 
it I represented the animals holding festival and 



frolic, dancing and gambolling from morning to 
night, and man among them all, their master and 
their king, the only worker, weary with the noise 
of their everlasting merriment. 

The moral to be deduced from such an idea 
can be easily perceived. On the one hand, life 




but for a day, joys of a moment, fleeting plea- 
sures soon interrupted by death ; on the other, 
deep meditation, consideration for the future, 
heroic sacrifices, indefinite perfectibility .purchased 
at the price of great sufferings. 

I had just put the finishing stroke to my 


composition, and it had assumed a sufficiently 
presentable shape, with the slight drawbacks of 
a few bad rhymes, a few halting lines, several 
inflated passages in bad taste, a great many re- 
dundant adjectives, and a thousand more details 
neglected in the manufacture, when I all at once 
perceived that the beasts these poor beasts whom 
I had so maligned themselves too had to undergo 
severe labour, and were obliged to toil as wearily 
for their livelihood as ourselves. 

First, the mole, a prudent creature notwith- 
standing her supposed blindness, showed me that 
she had to burrow in the earth to find her food. 
Then I remembered that the beaver is a clever 
engineer, and that the spider has nothing to learn 
from our weavers. Besides, I called to mind the 
green woodpecker, that has to pierce the trees 
with hundreds of blows of its beak before it can 
obtain its food ; and I deliberated with fear on 
the quantity of kicks, bites, and blows endured 
by an individual of the feline race before the 
close of her existence. 



Certainly I Lad set out on a wrong track, and 
was just about to make myself very ridiculous 
with a foolish poem under my arm. Yet let it 
not be supposed that I was totally discouraged by 
this discovery. At sixteen one is not cast down 
by such a trifle, and my resolution was soon 
taken. I instantly commenced another wurk, not 
less remarkable than the first, in which I showed 
that man, far from being superior to the other 
animals, owes to them all his inventions. 

I did not then know my meadow ; or what a 
likeness could I have traced between the black 
or tawny ants contending for the hunting-grounds, 
of which my old Pear-Tree forms the centre, and 
certain tribes of Indians ! 

Lonely expeditions in the forest, the discovery 
of a trail, attacks, surprises, prudent retreats, 
furious combats, capture of prisoners what ad- 
ventures to describe ! Happily for the reader I 
am past sixteen, and will go straight to my facts 

The tawny ants are divided into two great 
nations, distinguished by their colour, which is 


in greater or less proportions of black or red. 
The first inhabit by choice the large woods, and 
make their home among the fern ; the others 
establish themselves in hedges and meadows. 
Otherwise their habits are almost alike. 

The dwellings of these ants are, composed 
of pieces of stubble, morsels of wood, pebbles, 
half broken shells, and of all substances of easy 
transport that they can lay their hands on. 
They even pick up grains of wheat, barley, and 
oats as building material, and this has given the 
notion of their making magazines of provisions 
for winter use. Their architects are very skilful, 
and invest their city with the form of a little 
mountain or dome, with buttresses above the 
ground so that the rain-water may the easier 
run off, and not cause irreparable ravages. Our 
insects are prudent, and wish to protect themselves 
from over-sudden changes of temperature. The 
greatest portion of the nest is hidden, and extends 
more or less deeply Tindtr ground. Avenues, of 
funnel shape but irregular, lead from the top of 


the building to the interior. In number they are 
proportioned to the population of the colony, and 
they are also larger or smaller at their opening. 
Occasionally a great street, the central artery of 
daily movement, passes from one end to the other 
of the hill ; many roads, of nearly equal size are 
often found there, and narrow passages all around 
them conducting to the different quarters- of the- 
city. 

Light is agreeable to the tawny ants,, and they 
care not for the presence of man. They run 
about all day if the sky is clear, and go home- 
at the approach of bad weather, or at nightfall. 
They may then be seen carrying little stakes, 
which they plant in the rampart of chaff in 
order to close up the entrances of their galleries, 
after which they fetch some more smaller ones, 
which they place crosswise against the first. The 
barricades thus formed are strengthened with a 


covering of dry leaves, and the ants are at home. 
As soon as the city gates are shut sentries are 
placed there to watch over the general security, 





and the rest of the tribe take their repose. 
When dawn returns animation recommences ; ' the 
sentries are relieved, the galleries re-opened, and 




the general thoroughfares restored. These works 
are done regularly morning and evening through the 
summer season, unless it is decidedly rainy weather. 




In this case the inhabitants of the ant-hill do 
not pursue their usual course, and their doors 
remain closed. 

Such is the nature of the city of the tawny 
ants ; let us see how they proceed in constructing 
it. Their builders are at work, and do not take 
any further notice of us than if we were not 
lords of creation ! The word is given. They 
have a consultation, and begin by excavating in 
the earth a smaller or larger cavity. Some of the 
ever-industrious workers go to seek materials in 
the vicinity fit for the construction of the ex- 
terior works, and arrange them, not indeed with 
symmetry, but with care to .defend the entrance 
of their future habitation. Others bring portions 
of the earth that they have dug up in making 
the excavation before spoken of, combine them 
with the materials already laid, and take pains 
to fill the spaces and make the -building strong. 
To judge from the outside one would think that 
it was a solid mass, but we know that it is not 
so. The interior is gradually hollowed, and soon 


divided into several stages, and penetrated by 
galleries which, though low and rudely constructed 
perfectly fulfil their object of serving as a place 
of security for the larvae and nymphse. By 
degrees a large hall of magnificent proportions 
is raised in the centre of the city. It is much 
larger than the other chambers, and the ceiling 
is sustained by great beams curiously supporting 
one another. All the galleries lead to it, and the 
popular assemblies are there held. 

Another tribe of ants, the soldier or sanguine, 
are much like the tawny ants ; the heads and 
antennae of the neuters are of a tawny red, their 
abdomen ash-coloured black. Their habitations are 
composed of earth mixed with bits of leaves, blades 
of grass, moss, and little stones, and are generally 
found in hedges lying towards the south. They 
present this remarkable fact to be observed, that 
living side by side with the proper sanguine popu- 
lation is another of helots or slaves, condemned 
to the more laborious tasks. It is a mixed 
society, rendered very formidable to its neigh- 


bours by its military organization, and whose 
warriors have acquired much fame in the world 
of hymenoptera by their impetuous valour. 

Behold them making a foray traversing any 
great hollows in the ground, with mandibles raised 
on high, and glaring eyes, seeking their enemies ! 
Suddenly they perceive some forms of ash-coloured 
black, from a colony not far from- them. 

This colony is of the humblest sort, for the 
population who have formed it only possess one 
simple and rude ark. They excavated the ground, 
and, bringing it grain by grain, formed a vault 
and covered the gate of the city. Then under 
the vault the workers made trenches at different 
distances, and of a nearly equal depth. The 
rampart of earth between them is treated with 
care to serve as a support for the walls and par- 
titions of the abodes. It is not very fine archi- 
tecture, but what can a wretched insect do with 
no chisel save its teeth, or compasses save its an- 
tennoe, or any other trowel than its fore-feet \ 

Poor and humble as it is, this ant-hill is 


observed by the soldiers, and having held a council 
of war, they determine to lay siege thereto. Some 
warriors, full of warlike ardour, advance at once 
to the camp of the ash-coloured blacks or negroes, 
and spread themselves around the entrance. Imme- 
diately the inhabitants of the menaced community 
are in great anxiety. They rush into their galleries 
to give the alarm, and advance in numbers, bravely 
rushing upon the intruders. An engagement 
ensues, and some over-venturesome sanguines are 
overwhelmed by numbers and carried into cap- 
tivity. Their companions are contented with 
defending their positions. Calm and confident in 
the success of their arms, they await reinforce- 
ments. Every moment small bands of their own 
party come to join and increase their numbers. 
By degrees they approach the camp of the 
negroes, and seem more willing to come to close 
quarters ; but the more they mingle with the 
besieged, the more they seem in haste to send 
couriers to their own nest. These last arrive in 
haste, deliver their message, give orders, and at 



THE HYMENOPTEROUS WORLD. 79 

once a new swarm starts to join the army. Yet 
the sanguines do not hasten to give battle, and 
only alarm the negroes by keeping their ground. 
The latter occupy a space of two square feet in 
front of their ant-hill ; the greater part of the 
nation has come forth to take part in the 
struggle. Around the parallels of attack are now 
to be seen individual conflicts,- and generally it 
is the besieged who attack the besiegers. A 
vigorous defenee might be expected, from the 
great numbers of the negroes, but they are not 
confident in their forces, and are oppressed by the 
thought of the Burslings confided to them, and of 
the methods of securing their republic from entire 
destruction. 

Long before the issue of the contest can be 
foreseen they may be observed carrying their 
larvae out of the caves, and heaping them lap at 
the side opposite to that assaulted. Thus they can 
more easily convey them off if r contrary to all ex- 
pectation, victory does not favour the right ! The 
young females also hurry in the same direction. 


It is only just in time, for the storm draws 
near, and the thunder will soon break in the 
midst of this terrified population. The soldiers, 
now in force, throw themselves on the enemy, 
attack them at all points, and even reach the 
dome of the city. The negroes, after a deter- 
mined conflict, give up the defence, arid, seizing 
the nymphse they had heaped together outside the 
ant-hill, raise them in their mandibles, and run 
off in all directions. The soldiers pursue them, 
and endeavour to carry off the treasure. In the 
midst of the -defeat some blacks with admirable 
devotion still resist, strive to penetrate into the 
low passages to convey off some larvae from 
thence, and are at least secure of the honour 
of perishing on the field of battle. 

Alas ! there is a moment when heroism 
becomes madness. The city is given over to be 
pillaged. The soldiers run all over it, seize 
the whole of the avenues, and seem as if they 
would take possession of the devastated nest. 
Dividing into squadrons, they proceed to carry 


off any larvae and nymphse that may have been 
loft behind. They establish a continuous chain 
from one habitation to the other, and employ 
the rest of the day in housing their plunder. 
At nightfall, when of necessity the work must 
cease, all is not yet under cover. This is pro- 
vided for ; a post of sanguines keeps watch in 
the city taken by assault to keep off other 
depredators. 

Next day at dawn they begin again to bear 
off their prey ; while the vanquished nation, 
resigned to their fate, found a new colony 
elsewhere. 

Every year these sanguine ants make five or 
six such expeditions to provide themselves with 
slaves and assistants. Born for fighting, they 
understand no domestic labours. It is their 
slaves to whom is entrusted the task of con- 
structing their galleries, of tending the larvae 
and nymphae, and of all the little labours of 
their common life. The negroes which have 
become captives have no idea of escaping from 


their conquerors. They receive them with delight 
as they come home from their hunting expeditions, 
and devote themselves to their service with un- 
alloyed zeal. 




Really, is not all this very strange? What! 
can miserable insects speak of their campaigns, 
recount their wounds, and boast of their ex- 



ploits ? Doubtless ! but our self-love need not 
take offence : they have not yet invented any 
needle-gun nor improved rifled cannon. Besides, 
they only fight when necessary, and do not know 
how to enjoy a triumph. We are more advanced 
in that way, thanks to our civilization ; not only 
do we fight when compelled by circumstances, 
but also for glory, the honour of the flag, and 
the pleasure of conquest. Indeed, as chronicles 
say, we often take up arms without knowing 
why, without even asking why. Such facts are 
enough to insure to us an unquestioned supe- 
riority over the wretched ants. 

The nation of sanguines not only owns slaves, 
but also breeds numerous herds. It is true that 
their cattle are not much like ours. They are 
of all colours, green, white, bronze, or pearl grey. 
Many browse peacefully on the old Pear-Tree, and 
they are as brown as if dipped in coffee. They are 
small insects, having six slender little feet. At 
the end of their solid potbellied bodies are found 
two tubes, terminated by a kind of mouth. 


Some of those insects have wings, and all have 
two long horns bent over their backs, and are 
fed by means of a trunk that they insert 
into vegetable tissues. 

Is not this description very plain, like all 
other descriptions ? In case the reader cannot 




find the answer to the riddle (which would be 
no surprise to us), we will make haste to explain 
it. The milch-cows of the ants are no other 
than plant-lice (aphides). 

Who has not seen them encircling flower 
stems, slipping under the bark of trees, assem- 



bling on the foot-stalk of leaves, in a hideous 
mass side by side, motionless, apparently almost 
inert, leaving round them sweet, sticky spots? The 
ants are very fond of this honey, which passes 
from two tubes we have described as adorning 
the bodies of the plant-lice. They climb to the 
highest branches to gather it, and force the 
insect that produces it to deliver it up to them 
by striking it with their antennae. The dark 
ants especially, and some other species, have 
recourse to this curious proceeding in order to 
obtain food. A few draughts are enough to 
satisfy them. The red ant dexterously seizes the 
little drop of liquor with the swollen extremity 
of the antennse, which she carries to her mouth, 
using these organs as though they really were 
fingers. 

The yellow ants, who hardly ever leave their 
underground dwellings, are always surrounded by 
a great number of plant-lice. Other species, at 
once more ingenious and more prudent, build 
special habitations for them, and collect them 



there. These houses are in different shapes. 
Sometimes they are like a sphere, with the stalk 
of a plant for its axis, and the lower part 
pierced with a very small hole. In other cases, 
when made by the red ants, they are composed 
of a pipe about two inches and a half long and 
nearly as large across. M. Huber, to whom we 
owe so many interesting observations on ants, 
found one of these cases intended for their 
cattle raised, five feet from the ground on a 
small branch of a poplar, just as it sprung from 
the trunk. It was composed of rotten wood, 
and consisted of a short blackish tube. The 
ants entered it from the inside of the tree by 
several excavations, and crept in through an 
opening made at the root of the branch without 
exposing themselves to the daylight. 

The plant-lice of the common plantain retire 
under the root leaves when the stem dries up. 
The ants follow them there, and shut themselves 
up with them by filling with moist earth all the 
intervals between the ground arid the edge of 



the leaves. Then excavating the soil beneath, 
they obtain more space for approaching the 




prisoners, and arrange galleries leading to their 
own dwelling. 

These works are not useless, for they secure 
them victuals for rainy days. Indeed the ants 


do not become torpid at less than two degrees 
below freezing, and when it is not cold their 
activity is not checked. At such times they 
would be in danger of perishing without especial 
resources. The plant-lice furnish what they want, 
and a most extraordinary fact they become 
torpid at the same temperature as their guardians, 
and awake from their lethargy at the same time 
as they do. The kinds of ants that have not 
the instinct of appropriating them to themselves 
at least know the spots where they are in hiding, 
and bring back to their companions the small 
quantity of honey they have gathered from them. 
They charitably distribute these liquid juices, 
whose evaporation is very slow, indeed almost 
insensible. 

The preservation of plant-lice is of so much 
importance to the ants that they even go and 
collect the eggs of these insects. This M. Huber 
has absolutely observed the yellow ants doing. 
They gather and guard these eggs, lick them conti- 
nually, cover them with a gluten that fastens them 



together, and, in short, perform all the cares 
necessary for their welfare. They perform this 
task so well that the precious germs bear fruit 
inside the ant-hill as well as in their natural 
position. 

Could one believe that a solitude is so replete 
with life without having studied the mysteries 
of a tuft of grass ? 



CHAPTER VI. 

WANDERING TRIBES. 

WHILE the labours of the ants were taking 
up my whole attention, the wind had gradually 
risen ; it bent the flexible stems of grass, and 
made them glitter in the sun like ribands of 
crystal with dazzling lustre. The aspect of 
the meadow changed, and my thoughts insensibly 
took another course. I ceased to observe what 
passed around me, to listen to the rustle of the 
grass, the buzzing of insects, and the thou- 
sand noises resounding through space, coming 
from no one knows where, rising, increasing^ 
and diminishing, and all blending together in an 
indefinable harmony. 



Some twigs of the old Pear-Tree were put slightly 
in motion, stretching their long pale green stems 
against the cloudy background of the sky; soon 
the young leaves began to flap, making gleams 
of reflecting light around ; then all were shaken 
at once, producing a heavy and prolonged sound 
like the distant echo of a church organ. One of 
them all at once was broken off from the branch 
it grew upon, was lifted and whirled about in 
the air, wandered for some time round my head, 
and at last fell near me on a tuft of wormwood 
reflecting pale silvery light. Its foot-stalk had 
been eaten away by some insect, and this had 
occasioned its fall before the early chills of 
autumn. On the outer side between two veins 
lay a ' sort of sheath of a brown colour and 
quite dried up. All round this sheath, too skil- 
fully constructed not to be a habitation, extended 
a white discoloured spot, making a marked inroad 
on the rest of the leaf, still green and fleshy. 

This sheath excited my curiosity, and I soon 
discovered the use of it. It served as a shelter 



to a little caterpillar belonging to the numerous 
and powerful family of Tinese. 

This little caterpillar, though common, is never- 
theless not easy to find. Like the Arab shepherds, 
it bears along with it a light tent, often changing 
its residence quits the realms of dearth and moves 
to those where food is abundant. Its tent is the 
sheath that protects its frail and delicate body 
from the attacks of its enemies ; the territory 
it roams over is a light leaf waving in the least 
breeze. Behold it, after one moment's astonish- 
ment at the aerial flight just performed, advancing 
with head down and tail in the air, all the time 
enclosed in. the sheath. At length it pauses, 
makes a slight cut in the leaf, and sliding between 
the two pellicles that form its surfaces, devours 
their contents. When all within reach is con- 
sumed, and it appears that no more nourishment 
can be obtained without entirely coming out of 
the sheath, it again sets out on its travels, 
again takes up a fresh position, and repeats the 
same manoeuvres. 



These sheaths are found not only on the pear 
but also on the elm, the alder, and on some other 
trees. When the constructors, who, though they 
are all of the same family, have different tastes, 
use notched leaves, they dispose the notches in 
such a way as to give the most curious appearance 
to their habitations. Their tent strongly resembles 




a miniature brown fi^fo, placed upright, and showing 
the profile of its long dorsal fin like a saw. 

If the Tineee are pulled out of their garment, 
they display the greatest distress, and set to 
work at once to make a new covering. They 
begin by passing the head between the two mem- 
branes of a leaf and lodge in its thickness. 
There they are under cover, and only have to 
cut out their coat. This must be made of two 





similar pieces united above and below them. The 
two pellicles that they have separated make the 
cloth. They know their trade ; they cut to right 
and left with their mandibles, 
which make an excellent pair 
of scissors, and join the two 
pieces as they lie one above 
the other with threads of 
silk. These garments always 
fit their owners, and are 
sometimes very elegant. An 
old Tinea near its transform- 
ation will never muffle itself 
up like a young caterpillar 
on its first campaign. How 
many old beaux, decking 
their mature age in a vernal 
scabbard, should be sent to the school of the 
Tinese! How many tailors, not to say dress- 
makers, would do well to be apprenticed for 
some time on my great Pear-Tree, and study 
there the true principles of their art ! 



Indeed the always tasteful toilet of the insects 




is admirably adapted to their habits, and ar- 
ranged for their individual peculiarities and 


makes a complete finish to them, and sets them 
off in a most curious way. Have our workmen 
any such artistic ideas ? The tinsel robes in 
which they muffle us, cut in one pattern, on 
pretext of fashion, have not in a general way 
the least relation to our peculiarities. 

Let us pursue the Tinea of the elm through 
her various transformations. Here she is escaping 
from her shell, no longer as a caterpillar, but 
provided with antennae, ready to take her flight 
as a perfect insect. Her wings glisten with gold 
and silver, and at their points small spots of 
velvety black set off to greater advantage the 
metallic lustre. Another variety which lives on 
the leaves of the nut-tree has its fore wings like 
a cock's tail, and banded transversely with 
alternate stripes of dead gold and burnished 
silver. Two little fine and delicate white tufts 
adorn their heads with splendid plumes. Had 
King Solomon in all his glory, when going to 
meet the Queen of Sheba, richer and more sump- 
tuous vestments than these ? 


Large animals are coarsely sketched by 
Nature, while she seems to have reserved the 
choicest gems of her rich cabinet for the smaller. 
Like those artists of the Middle Ages who delighted 
to carve numberless little figures between two 
blocks of stone and place them too high up to 
be seen, she reserves her special care for the 
minutest details of the great work. The bodies 
of most caterpillars present such a mixture of 
marvellously shaded colours, that the most skilful 
weaver could never reproduce such delicate com- 
binations. These shapeless worms crawling on 
the ground, and almost always hidden, have most 
splendid decorations. Some are marked with 
dots of divers hues, and a variety of spots ; 
others have stripes, diamonds, and bands of all 
sizes. Sometimes these markings give place to 
little tubercles projecting from the skin like so 
many precious stones. "Who has not seen sv arms 
of insects rise and sparkle in the sun, copper- 
plated, engraved, and enamelled in the most 
fantastic manner ? Could we ever be able to 

possess such a picture ? Besides, how should we 
get the silk which is our pride of adornment 
without robbing a humble larva of the soft 
envelope in which she has concealed herself? 

. Some varieties of Tinese are more ambitious 
than those that inhabit our old Pear-Tree, and are 
in the habit of making themselves more solid and 
durable cases. They live on walls, feeding on 
lichen, and gather small stones around them to 
build little cornucopia-shaped cells, large at one 
end and tapering towards the other. When ready 
to change into chrysalides, they firmly fix their 
house to the surface of the wall where they were 
born, there undergo their transformation, and issue 
at length, proudly displaying to the light of day 
two little bronzed and sparkling wings. 

But the life of caterpillars is not all rose- 
coloured, and all who have the will do not attain 
to the winged state. Some are left behind on 
the way, and might justly deplore their hard 
fate ! Not only do birds wage ceaseless war upon 
them, but they have also a formidable enemy, 




who glides into the thickest brakes, between the 
tree and its bark, among tufts of grass, wherever 
they hide, and prepares for them a shocking 
death, preceded by most bitter pangs. They 
dread his approach, perceive his coming, shudder 
at the sight of him, and yet cannot escape his 
terrible power. There he is, flitting above them 
like a vampire, grazing them with his gauze 
wings, for such he has, and searching for the 
spot where to alight on their soft defenceless 
body. The bark of our old Pear-Tree is 
covered with these deadly foes, and we can easily 
observe them there actively coursing in all di- 
rections. 

This formidable insect, the sound of whose 
wings is the death -knell of numbers of lepi- 
doptera, is shaped like a long thin fly, with small 
head and very slender antennae. It has four 
wings attached to the corselet, the two upper ones 
the longest. It has six tolerably long legs, 
especially the hinder ones. The body is lengthy, 
and only joined to the thorax by a very fine thread. 


It is known by the sufficiently crabbed name of 
Ichneumon. 

There are a vast number of species, and all 
carnivorous, but with notable differences in their 
customs. Some are black with ferruginous legs ; 
others have tawny feet and short tails ; some 
varieties are speckled ; others are found with 
black heads and yellow stomachs ; brown, tawny, 
variegated, and white ones are also met with. 
Their females seem to bear three stings of equal 
length, but really have only one, that in the 
middle, the two lateral appendages being only 
hollow blades, that when applied together form 
a sheath for the true sting. This sheath is 
black and hairy. The dart it covers is round, 
stiff pointed, hollow, and pierced near the ex- 
tremity. Its dark colour inclines to chestnut, 
and its surface is smooth. 

Now we know the actors in the drama, let 
us place them on the stage. 

And indeed as we look on the Pear-Tree we 
perceive, with its body adhering to one of the 




branches, a very common hairy caterpillar, with 
blue, brown, and white stripes on its back.* The 
head is of a greenish blue, specked with two 
small black spots. It is motionless, being gorged 
with leaves, and is, besides, on the point of 
spinning its cocoon. 




This is one of the usual victims of the yellow- 
footed Ichneumon. 

When she discovers it she descends on it, 
clings to the skin, and bores it with her auger. 
In vain does the caterpillar struggle ; however 
energetic is the resistance, it is thenceforward 
condemned, and nothing can save it from death. 
 

The wound just inflicted is filled with a number 
of eggs, and from them will issue as many 
voracious larvae, destined to live at its cost and 
feed upon its substance. At first it appears not 
to suspect its condition, and its habits seem 
unchanged. The young larvae that devour it are 
very careful not to attack the vital organs, as 
that would kill it outright and imperil their own 
existence. It was only man who, in conse- 
quence of his superior intelligence, ever thought 
of killing the goose with the golden eggs ! Our 
young Ichneumons, born at the foot of the ladder 
of existence, are too stupid to imagine such an 
idea. They act prudently, take care of their 
nurse, and only remove a fatty substance sufficient 
for their wants, of which she possesses abundance. 
Yet a time arrives when the caterpillar, though 
so long spared, must perish at last. The larvae 
having preyed upon it till nothing is left but 
skin, pierce it with their teeth, and issue forth 
to make their final change. Their victim may 
then be seen covered with little cocoons of 




yellow silk, moving tardily about, till at last 
he falls on the ground, and there his miserable 
existence terminates. 

Yet occasionally his enemies allow him time 
to turn into a chrysalis, but still the conclusion 







of the drama is always the same. Innumerable 
worms issue from the chrysalis, and covering it 
with their cocoons, a brood of flies issue from 
their lepidopterous cradle. 

As we have before said, the race of Ichneumons 
is very numerous, and we ought to be thankful 



for it, for without their presence all the fruits of 
the earth would be devoured before reaching our 
tables. Besides making war on caterpillars, they 
even sometimes lay their microscopic germs in the 
egg of a butterfly, and their tiny larvae find 
board and lodging there. They only exist by 
means of destruction, and rise alive from the 
bosom of decomposition. 



CHAPTER VII. 

NOTES OF THE TRAVELS OF A CENTIPEDE. 

A GREAT cloud, fully 'charged with electricity 
was forming on the horizon. It rose by degrees, 
mingling its grey tones with the blue of the sky, 
and at last extended all over my meadow. The 
irregular shadow covered the grass, and only 
allowed one feeble sunbeam to pass, and that 
struck upon a ridge of bark on the surface of the 
old Pear-Tree. 

Something was moving on this spot, which 
was now in the full light. There might be seeD 
a black head, round and very flat, with two bent 
antennae issuing from it. The motions of the 


creature were full of anxiety and indecision. It 
was coming up, going down again, was lost sight 
of for a moment, then reappeared, and seemed in 
great perplexity, until at last it issued completely 
from its hiding-place and crawled down the tree, 
dragging after it a kind of tawny ribbon, that 
slipped over the asperities of the bark like a 
trail of syrup. This tawny ribbon, on which, by 
closer inspection, I saw a number of articulations, 
was nothing else than the body of an animal 
borne on thirty little legs, trotting mincingly 
along, and each terminated by a hook. The 
last pair were turned upwards, terminating in 
bristles, so as to form a forked tail. 

Head, body, and tail, when they reached the 
ground, began by one consent to wriggle, forming 
a creature of no good report, the Scolopendra or 
Centipede.* It is generally found under stones, 
in dark places, at the base of walls, among the 
fibre of old stumps, wherever the air is 
tainted, dark, and heavy. The powerful loco- 



motive apparatus that is its characteristic is only 
acquired by age. Successive additions compose 
its being, and each of its rings is equivalent to a 
mark of antiquity. 

Just as the Scolopendra made its appearance 
on the meadow, a swarm of little insects, hardly 
to be seen by very good eyes, but whose curious 
structure I could easily distinguish, thanks to 
the second sight that I enjoyed, were jumping 
among the grass from stalk to stalk, with 
wonderful agility. They might have been taken 
for a band of squirrels, lost in a grassy forest, 
making it alive with their incessant activity. 
They had on their backs a sort of mane, bore two 
antennae bent forwards, and sprang from one 
place to another by means of a long elastic tail 
that they pressed upon the ground at the moment 
of making their spring. They were the Poduras 
(Skip tails), an especially cosmopolitan race, who 
plant their colonies in the fields, and even on the 
surface of stagnant water, and also on the snow 
in the coldest regions of the globe. 



They described around me numberless ca- 
pricious circuits, when one of them falling to the 
ground, was all at once enveloped in a tawny 
cloud, and disappeared under the grass. Another 
and another suffered the same fate without their 
absence being remarked by their comrades. The 
Scolopendra was in ambush, and satiating itself 
with its favourite food. 

"Decidedly," thought I, "here is a tribute 
quickly levied. If a man did as much, his 
tongue would not be long enough to boast of his 
exploits, and he would need to employ those of 
others to trumpet his fame." 

The Scolopendra thought otherwise. She left 
her post of observation, climbing carelessly towards 
a slope, stopped behind a pebble, resumed her 
march, and arrived at a round hole dug in the 
sand, not far from the lines of circumvallation 
that had been traced by the mole-cricket. She 
put her head into the hole, and quickly taking it 
out again hastened to hide under a dry leaf 

Her alarm was not without cause. A dull 



sound was heard from the bottom of the sub- 
terranean habitation that she had discovered, like 
the distant murmuring of a fountain, giving notice 
to all comers that if this retreat contained a 
treasure, there was also a dragon to guard it. 

The noise increased, and with it in proportion 
grew my curiosity. Imagination is excited by the 
approach of the unknown, under the continual 
expectation of discovering a novelty. 

In much excitement I said to myself, " What 
am I going to see ? Nature is so rich, and my 
knowledge is still so poor." 

Nevertheless I rejoiced in my agitation, as it 
promised me new discoveries. Nothing proves 
ou>f imperfection so much as this necessity 6f 
escaping from oneself, and mingling with the 
life of others. The mind, like the body, requires 
food. It is only nourished by successive assimi- 
lations, starves when solitary, and dies of inani- 
tion at the end of too strict a fast. 

Thank Heaven that was not my case. I was 
a fresh enough guest in my stall in Nature's 






theatre, and patiently awaited the rising of the 
curtain. 

I had not long to wait. A dark object 
suddenly appeared at the opening of the cave, 
storming and buzzing in a most menacing fashion, 




as if to complain of the mischief-maker that had 
dared to cross the threshold. Then I saw, not a 
dragon, but a great fly of the bee family. It 
passed without the smallest concern over the 
web of a little spider, which contented itself 
with humbly pulling a string on its passage. 



The Scolopendra was invisible, and not even 
the tips of her antennae could be seen. 

When the fly had made some circles in the 
air, she returned to her nest, brushed her wings 
with delight, threw out a few grains of sand 
that had stuck between the ruddy bristles that 
covered her body, and re-entered 'the house. She 
went some distance along a narrow tubular gallery 
with very smooth walls, and came to a sort of 
lump made of earth glued together, separate from 
the ground, pierced full of holes, and containing 
a quantity of little chambers varnished inside 
and very comfortable. In each of these chambers, 
softly lying on a honey cake, was a whitish 
worm, destined likewise to have wings and think 
of perpetuating its species at a future day. 
Sometimes another destiny, and not so happy, is 
in store for them, since enemies in great num- 
bers prowl around this well-concealed cell. Let 
one ant make the discovery and a hundred others 
follow in a row, attack the poor guardian bee, 
and kill the larvae in the cradle. Their existence 



is in imminent danger even before they issue from 
the egg. A stranger fly, taking advantage of any 
short absence of the brooding mother, slips into 
the newly vacated place, leaves there her own 
germ, and hastily escapes. The bee has seen 
nothing, and lives deceived, without a suspicion 
that she is harbouring a murderer, and that its 
savage larva will soon be sole mistress of this 
spacious abode made with so much labour. 

Some of the congeners of our bee, less rustic 
in their habits, prefer the neighbourhood of man. 
They flit around his houses, and selecting a 
wrought stone decide on hanging their habitation 
there. And how shall they accomplish this design ? 
They know not how to spin a cocoon like the 
caterpillar, or make a web of silk like the spider. 
It matters not ; they will not fail for want of 
materials, for their resolution is great. The rest 
they make will be of a kind of mortar, that as 
it hardens will become as firm as granite. They 
will go to the quarry, there select a grain of sand, 
cover it with a viscous liquid, lay it close to 





another grain, make a little lump of them, take 
this up in their mouths, knead it, put it in its 
place, and gradually build their nest. 




This nest, constructed with so much labour, is 
divided into several compartments, all of the same 
size, and each enclosing an egg, as well as the 



paste required by the grub that is to be hatched 
there. 

The erection of such a building, wisely 
adapted to the needs of the inhabitants, does 
not fail to present some difficulty. Everybody 
is not a born mason ; so some unscrupulous bees 
sometimes endeavour to seize the property of 
their neighbours. Without the slightest remorse 
they enter a half-made cell, look it over, examine 
it, give a stroke of the trowel, and prepare to 
take possession of it. Then comes the real 
owner laden with mortar, white with lime, in 
working dress. They look at one another, and 
doubtless remonstrances are exchanged ; then the 
dispute waxes warmer, the two bees hurl defiance 
at one another, rush out, and prepare to settle 
their dispute by force of arms. 

What description can do justice to the ani- 
mated scene that ensues upon these first hos- 
tilities ? Let us for a moment transport ourselves 
from the old Pear-Tree to a vast arena where the 
soil has been carefully levelled, and around which 



are raised a quantity of seats, surmounted by 
banners, shields, and pamans. Two knights in 
full armour, with visors closed, lance in rest, 
and shield on arm, mounted on powerful horses, 
barbed likewise with iron, are ready to rush on 
each other. The word is given, and they dart 
forward enveloped in a cloud of dust. 




A long shudder passes through the crowd. 
Many hearts beat, impatient to take flight, and 
go and burn themselves at this devouring flame 
that attracts and maddens the masses. Success ! 
Some souls of worth, more noble, more generous, 
reserve their sympathy for the vanquished. Such 
are scarce, very scarce, as scarce as charity, self- 
denial, and devotion. 


The two foemen have broken their lances, but 
their swords remain. Steel meets with steel ; 
the horses rear ; they seize each other round the 
body, and the issue of the combat appears for 
a moment doubtful. One of the combatants at 
last rises in his saddle, gathers up his strength, 
stretches his muscles, draws a deep breath, and 




with a sudden movement, quick and vigorous, 
throws the enemy on the ground amid the loud 
applause of the multitude. 

Is this a tournament I have described, or a 
duel between two flies \ At all events, our bees 
do just the same as the warriors of ancient time 



fly against each other head to head, swerve aside 
from each other, meet again, clash terribly to- 
gether, and fall stunned by the shock. Like the 
knights, if the first onset does not decide the 
victory they clutch each other in fury, and even 
strike with their dagger, namely, with their sting, 
like them. 

But we will not continue this humiliating 
parallel. And what would it prove that every 
one does not know already? When on the plain 
the shepherd appears larger than his sheep, the 
oak surpasses the shepherd, the tower of the 
village church exceeds the oak. In proportion 
to the elevation above the valley all these 
gradations gradually disappear, the details merge 
in the whole ; the landscape is lost in shade, 
there are no more giants, and all is small to- 
gether. 

This is the reason why the Grecian muse, in 
her choice of a dwelling-place, would not climb 
too high, but stopped upon Parnassus. 



CHAPTER VIII. 



SOLITARY BEES. 



THE sky was clear again, the skiptails jumping 
in the grass ; all was calm and peaceable in the 

meadow, and yet the 
Scolopendra did not 
appear again. Why 
did she not re-enter the 
hall of bark after such 
an exciting expedi- 
tion ? Probably she 
would have gladly 
done so, but circum- 
stances beyond her 
coutiol made it impossible for her to return. 



She had been ejected because her abode was to 
be demolished, and had been expelled by superior 
force. 

The inhabitants of a great city who are used 
to live among a crowd, and to shift their house- 
hold gods from one place to another, can never 
believe what is the pain of quitting an old 
nest ennobled by memory, and hallowed by custom. 
There is the sense of leaving behind a whole 
phase of existence on the removal. The old 
home unites the past and present, henceforth to 
be divided by an impassable barrier. Did the 
Scolopendra feel all the bitterness of this flitting ? 
I could not affirm this, but I am sure I 
experienced it for her. I love old houses, full 
of antique furniture, and showing everywhere the 
traces of the departed. One is not alon6 amid 
those grand walls that have been the cradle and 
the tomb of a whole race. A tutelary genius, 
the spirit of the family, watches in their shades, 
low murmuring in the ear of the living a thou- 
sand simple and touching words such as do them 





good. This mysterious charm does not attach to 
new mansions ; they remain dumb, and poetry 
finds no echoes there. These are but hackneyed 
hostels, good for nothing but transacting business. 

We said that the Scolopendra had removed 
that the house might be pulled down. This is 
what had happened to it, at least as I conjecture, 
for I studied it for a few minutes, and my eyes 
had only been directed thither at the moment of 
her departure. 

She had been established, as we know, under 
a fold of bark on the surface of the old Pear-Tree. 
Her retreat lay just below a great dry branch, which, 
having been broken by a storm, hung down the 
tree held by a few fibres. A smooth shining- 
bodied fly, of bluish black, with four wings of 
dark violet, namely the carpenter bee, had ob- 
served this dead branch and set to work on it. 
Our bee had excellent carpenter's tools that is to 
say, two great teeth formed of solid bits of shell 
bent into augers, convex above, and ending in a 
fine but strong point. She had then bored a 



hole towards the centre of the branch, but in an 
oblique direction. As she proceeded with her 
excavation she cast forth a quantity of sawdust, 
which gathered in a heap on the ground. A great 
expense of power, energy, and patience was re- 




quired to bring such an enterprise to a successful 
issue ; but where is the bee in whom these qua- 
lities are lacking? They know what they want, 
which is a rare quality, and only desire what 
they can perform, and that is a still rarer one. 



After several weeks of labour the wood-borer 
had pierced a cavity of nearly twelve inches in 
depth, very smooth, perfectly emptied, and very 
regular. Then, without taking any time for repose, 
she went afield to gather honey, and had filled 
with it the whole of the lower part of the cavity 
just spoken of, so as to make a mass there of 
about an inch in height. When this was done 
she laid an egg upon the paste in the fashion 
of the mason bee. 

The Scolopendra had been scared by the 
unusual noises ringing around her during these 
many goings to and fro, and had judged it best 
to leave her own hut since it was in such a 
dangerous neighbourhood. 

The, bee took no more notice, being absorbed 
in her more important cares. Of course she had 
not made a hole twelve inches long to put only 
one egg into it. She went out again, picked up 
a little wood -dust, tempering it with a sort of 
glue, brought it, and attached it to the walls 
of the hole above the provision of honey. On 



the inner rim of this first circular layer of saw- 
dust she placed a second ring concentric with 
the first, then a third of smaller diameter. Soon 
there was only a little hole left that she could 
easily fill. Then the egg was enclosed in a real 
chamber, firmly sealed up on all sides, and its 
ceiling became the floor of a new cell, also con- 
taining honey. Thus she constructed twelve 
chambers intended as habitations for as many 
grubs, all having near them the amount of sub- 
sistence necessary for their wants until the time 
of their charge. 

What would our collectors of statistics, gentle- 
men who are such hands at putting figures to- 
gether, say if they were asked to estimate within 
a few crumbs what an individual of their species 
would eat before arriving at his majority ? Ah, 
how the wood-borer would laugh at their answer ! 
Or at least we will do so as her proxies. 

Apropos to this, may I be allowed to recall 
an amusing anecdote told by M. Eeaumur in one 
of his Memoirs? 





In the first days of the month of July 1736 
an auditor of the Accountant-general's office, lord 
of a village near Andelys, on the Seine, was 




walking backwards and forwards in his drawing- 
room. When I say he was promenading, I must 
avow that it is only a supposition on my part, for 



M. Reaumur has not preserved these details. 
Perhaps he was seated in his arm-chair delicately 
wrapped in a small-patterned flowered dressing- 
gown, a very suitable dress for an auditor ; but 
this point has remained in doubt. A servant, 
prudently only opening the door a little way, an- 
nounced that a gardener from Andelys demanded 
an audience. 

He was introduced, a fine-looking man of 
five feet eleven inches, bony, muscular, fair, of 
a dazed look, with great brown eyes on a level 
with his cheeks. He took off his cap, bowed 
with a scrape of the foot, coughed, blushed, and 
remained quiet. 

" Well," said his master, " what is the news ? " 

" Alas, sir," said the gardener, " a misfortune 
has happened ! There is a wizard in the village, 
and your whole estate is ruined and undone. 
Not a workman will strike a pick into the ground 
there any more. Please to look." 

With these words he held out a little box 
to his master, who, after such an amazing prelude, 



opened it with much curiosity. In it were some 
small cases made of rose leaves rolled up. These 
perfectly closed cases seemed to have been made 
with the utmost care, and were of remarkable 
beauty. The auditor looked carefully at these 
curious objects, touched them, felt them all over, 
and was astonished at their marvellous complete- 
ness and finish. 

The gardener continued : " They were found 
in one of the borders in front of the house. They 
were not hid there for nothing, and he who buried 
them knew very well what he was about." 

" Indeed it is strange ; but you know, John, 
no one believes in wizards." 

John Paul shook his head, made a most 
intricate grin expressive of both respect and of 
doubt, turned and twisted his cap in embarrass- 
ment, and then bashfully replied : 

" As your worship pleases ; but the cunning 
man to whom I showed these things could not 
say any good of them. 1 am sure I should come 
to harm if I went on working on the place." 


The auditor rose, rang, dressed himself, and 
went to a surgeon who was a friend of his, followed 
by the villager. He did not believe that there 
was anything alarming in the story told him, 
but he wished to have the opinion of a skilful 
practitioner. Contrary to his expectations, the ex- 
pedient was unsuccessful. Though the surgeon 
was very skilful in his own business, he could 
give none of the desired information. 

What was to be done ? They went to the 
Abbe Nollet, who was well known for his accurate 
study of natural history. 

The gardener, trembling all over, presented 
the famous rolls to him, more confident than 
ever that they had a savour of brimstone. Accord- 
ing to him, there could not be a doubt. Besides 
that, he thought no common man could do such 
a piece of work ; he could not think why trouble, 
such trouble, could have been taken, or such a 
performance buried a spade deep. A wizard 
alone could have put these accursed cases in 
such a place to effect some charm. 



The Abbe Nollet only answered this fair rea- 
soning by a smile, for he had very good reasons 
for not believing it. He went to a drawer, and 


took from it other sheaths of leaves cleverly 
worked by the scarabseus beetles, and showed 
them to the rustic, telling him that they were 
made by insects, and that those which had caused 
him so much anxiety had no other origin. 

John Paul was shaken, but not convinced. 
If he had had the instinct of the Ichneumon, he 
would have displayed some of it in conversation 
with, this learned man, but he had only a little 
human sense, and what more is wanted for 
cherishing an illusion? .Nothing is so pleasing 
as an error, especially when it issues in smart 
attire from the secret recesses of the fancy. 

M. Nollet meanwhile had set to work to undo 
one of the rolls that they had brought him, an 
attempt his visitors had ' never dared to make, 
and he took from it a fat larva, that writhed 
with rage at this unexpected violation of its 
domicile. 



The gardener cried out with astonishment when 
he saw this shapeless grub. He threw up his 
arms, opened his mouth, and laughed noisily. 

"I see what it is," said he, " and the cunning 
man is nicely wrong! It was my own opinion 
that he was a poor ignorant creature. I am going 
to put these under his nose, and there will be 
a fine noise about it in the village." 

-"But," said the Abbe quietly, "I thought you 
were of the same opinion as he was." 

" I oh yes ! that is to say, no ; I thought that 
there was something more behind it, that is all." 

How often is this scene repeated from Paris 
to China? 

The pretty rolls that then caused such a dis- 
turbance are the work of the Megachile cen- 
tuncularis. This is another kind, of bee, though 
by its terrible scientific name it would seem 
rather as if it were an antediluvian monster than 
a humble hymenopterous insect. 

The cutter of rose leaves, faithful to the habits 
of her tribe, bores the ground, and makes in it 



a gallery of ten or twelve inches deep. In this 
gallery are found these magic cases so ingeniously 
folded. Each of them is composed of six or 
seven sheaths of the same size laid end to end 
and enclosed in one cover. Taking this off, they 
are found placed in order. They make a kind 
of cylinder, and are arranged like thimbles put 
partly one into the other. The circular entrance 
of the first covers the bottom of the second, 
which serves for the base of the third, and so 
on. Each of these little thimbles is a cell in- 
tended as a refuge for a grub, which undergoes 
two changes before becoming a bee. These cells 
contain honey, and are made so as to prevent the 
loss of one drop of this precious nourishment. 
Yet the leaves that compose them are not glued, 
but only placed close together. What are the 
modes of operation of the Megachile centuncu- 
laris (leaf-cutter bee) to obtain such a result ? 
We will try to rob her of the secret. 

Here she is pausing over a rose-tree all 
covered with beautiful scented flowers. This is 



her favourite tree, but not her exclusive choice, 
a& in case of need she will resort to another. 

The first thing is to take up a suitable posi- 
tion. She places herself on the outer edge of 
a leaf, so that she can hold the cut part between 
her legs and begin at the foot-stalk. Then 
setting to work she > cuts out a great round piece 
with her mandibles, working them as quickly as 
a pair of scissors. Her position is convenient 
for the purpose, but also presents some difficulties. 
The bee is perched on the bit she is cutting, and 
if care be not taken her weight will tear it off. 
To prevent any accident of this sort she begins 
to fly before the cut is finished, and for some 
time supports herself in the air without leaning 
on the material. 

When this work is done, she carries off the 
piece of leaf, holding it perpendicularly, .and carries 
it to line the subterranean gallery that she has 
hollowed out. Ten or twelve pieces of this kind 
are required to make a cell, all not being of the 
same thickness. The interior surface of each cell 


is composed of three of these pieces, of the same 
size, narrow at one end, larger at the other. The 
jagged margin of the leaves is always placed 
outside, while the smooth edge of the cut goes 
inwards. 

The Megachile centuncularis, like most insects, 
now takes pains to strengthen the exterior of 
the cell. For this purpose she surrounds it with 
three or four oval pieces, and then with other bits 
smaller in proportion. Besides, she takes good 
care not to let joint lie over joint. Like a good 
workman, she places the middle of each fragment 
of leaf upon the cut part of that just used 
before, so as to cover the joins. Also she folds 
back the end so as to give it a convex form. 
When the cell is complete she fills it with honey 
and pollen, puts an egg in it, and covers it with 
three pieces so perfectly circular that they might 
be supposed to have been drawn with compasses. 
Then she fills the whole gallery with similar 
chambers, the round end of one filling the open 
end of the next. If some unforeseen accident 




forces her to quit her work for a time, she is in 
haste to return, and hardly ever quits it before 
the whole is completed. Her perseverance to this 
end is remarkable. 

It is said that St. Francis Xavier, walking 
one day in the garden, saw a great winged insect 
walking there with head bent down, and the fore 
legs stretched out and elevated in the attitude 
of prayer. He was much astonished at this cir- 
cumstance, but much more so at hearing the 
humble creature chant ; a beautiful canticle after 
the custom of that period 'with great solemnity. 
What would he have said if he had studied the 
ways of our leaf- cutter of the rose ? It is true 
that she has no voice, but nature has given 
her a genius for mathematics a singular power 
of tracing ovals and circles, without perfect draw- 
ing instruments and a well- based knowledge 
of the laws of elasticity. Miracles are all around 
us ; in order to see them it is only necessary to 
open our eyes, but that, it appears, is the chief 
difficulty. 



CHAPTER IX. 



DIGGERS. 

MY old Pear-Tree, with its ever-blessed greeii 
shade, had a rich client with beautiful black eyes, 
that came sometimes to beg a little shade of him 
at those hours when the grass falters and bends 
under the burning rays of the sun. She walked with 
measured steps, a grave and majestic air, gathered 
a few flowers as she went, and lay down at the 
foot of the tree. Then, with head raised and body 
comfortably settled, she fixed her eyes on the 
horizon, mechanically moving her lips. Her march 
was followed by a little girl, as fresh as a rose, 
making a curious piece of knitting, never ended, 

 



but always renewed. This illustrious client lived 
at the farm, and was well known on the meadow, 
being greeted with the most discordant cries by a 
flock of jays every morning on her appearance. 
She lived there happy and thoughtless of the 




morrow, and was the delight 1 of her hosts. She was 
supposed to have been originally of the county of 
Durham, in England; but there was no actual 
proof of this. However that might be, her name 



was Betsy, and she belonged, as I have omitted to 
mention, to the bovine race. The stout farmer 
thought a great deal of her, and never spoke of 
the foreigner but in highest terms of the greatest 
praise. She replied to his compliments by a 
prolonged lowing, gave a flick of her tail to her 
sides, and returned to her peaceful meal, burying 
her nostrils deep in the grass. 

She had an enemy, though she had never done 
any harm to any one the Hypoderma bovis, who 
harassed her unceasingly with unrivalled obstinacy. 
This enemy was not to be dreaded for his strength, 
but that only made him the more dangerous. In- 
deed, more of life is spent in repelling trifling 
aggressions, annoyances constantly renewed, than in 
serious but honourable contests. Sometimes an oak 
scarred by lightning forms fresh bark, its torn 
leaves are renewed, and the branches half broken 
off by the electric fluid may recover again. But 
if attacked by grubs, its strength oozes out at a 
thousand punctures, and it is immediately dried up. 

Externally, Betsy's enemy was like a common 



fly, but very fat. Some writers have alleged him 
to be descended from the illustrious fly on the 
coach-wheel, described by La Fontaine, but we 
can hardly believe them, for her heirs had left the 
country for a town residence. The people who 
abhor Latin names, and justly so, do not know 
its title of Hypoderma bovis, and simply call it 
breeze-fly. 

The insect has great compound eyes, streaked 
with green and red, pointed antennae, strong wings, 
adorned with very conspicuous veinings. Its 
colours are dull and dark. Its carnivorous in- 
stincts would not have been suspected were 
not its secret inclinations revealed by the mouth, 
an organ of great expression in man as well as 
beast. This curiously constructed mouth ought 
to .be studied. It is composed of a kind of trunk, 
with a protecting sheath, and little white and very 
sharp teeth. 

With these sharp hooks it tormented peaceful 
Betsy. Some slight protuberances might already 
be remarked on the back of the pretty black cow, 



hardly visible among the hair, but very sensible 
to the touch. These round vesicles contained 
the larvae of the breeze-fly, foul, grub-shaped 
creatures, with two hooks at one end of their 
body, divided into a certain number of rings, and 
with no organ of locomotion. 

This greedy family, that feeds on living flesh 
and surrounds itself with corruption, is numerously 




represented. It contains the gad-fly, spoken of 
by Virgil in the " Georgics," the Gasterophyllus 
licemorrhoidalis that attaches itself to horses, with 
many other predatory flies. Humboldt and Bon- 
pland even discovered in South America a species 
of the same kind, that commits its ravages on 
man; the larva if disturbed buries itself deeply 
under the skin, and produces much inflammation, 



often fatal. It takes six months to perform all 
its metamorphoses, six long months, while the 
victim of the attack counts the hours, minutes, 
and even seconds. 

But we have wandered far from our subject, 
as we never intended, in talking of the monstrous 
client of the old Pear-Tree, to mention the Hypo- 
derma bovis, or any of its relations. A much fairer 
picture was ready to our pen, but it wanted a 
frame, and we did not know where to find one. 
The chief individual of this picture is still an 
insect, but an insect of such curious manners that 
it is hard to know how to exhibit it. The villagers, 
who readily follow Boileau's example, and call a cat 
a cat, describe it under the name of dung-beetle. 
This name implies much, and ought to show why 
the bearers of it are always found in meadows 
and high-roads. 

Entomologists place them in the tribe of Geo- 
trupes, OP Arenicolse. They may all be recognised 
by their hemispherical or oval body, by their wing- 
covers enveloping the abdomen, and especially by 



their mandibles, more than half uncovered, very 
strong, and much bent. As these insects are es- 
sentially diggers, their legs are large, sharp-edged, 
and much notched at the exterior edge. Their 
mission is to free the surface of the ground from 
anything that might seem offensive to delicate 
persons. With the exception of some of them, 
whose chosen domicile is in mushrooms, they are 
generally found in what is by choice avoided. 
They excavate sloping or upright holes under these 
matters, and bury themselves in them as soon as 
they fancy they are in danger. There is not much 
temptation to pursue them thither, but they do 
not fancy so. Perhaps they have good reason for 
getting under cover. Certain collectors, very full 
of Latin, are capable of searching everywhere. 

The dung-beetles only leave their retreat in 
the evening, and after having dressed themselves. 
Seeing them pass brilliant and lustrous, no one 
would suspect the life they lead. Their flight is 
noisy and heavy just above the ground. If they 
feel a touch, they at once counterfeit death not 



in a vulgar manner like the spiders, curling up into 
a ball and remaining quiet, but in a remarkable 
way, like true artists. Instead of bending back 
their legs and antennae to the body, like most 
insects, they, on the contrary, extend them, and 
hold them as stiff as they would be in a perfectly 
dried beetle. The imitation is so perfect that it 
deceives their enemies ; among others, the crows, 
who turn them over and over, and think them 
unworthy of a peck. The butcher bird, it seems, 
is not so easily deceived, and will not be so taken 
in. Dead or alive, he sticks all he meets upon 
the spines of the sloe, and devours them by degrees 
as his appetite requires them. 

The larvae of the dung-beetle live in the same 
place as their parents, at the bottom of a round 
hole of about fifteen inches deep, and full of food. 
They have a good deal of similarity to the grub 
of the cockchafer, and are whitish for a small 
portion of their front wings, and of a bluish or 
slaty grey on the rest of their body. 

After this preliminary description we come to 


the details of the picture, which are now more 
easy to describe. 

One day walking on the quay of Santa Lucia, 
at Naples, whence there is a view of Vesuvius, 
the blue waves of the Mediterranean, Castellamare, 
and Sorrento, I took it into my head to hire a 
boat and be transported to Capri, that picturesque 
island where Tiberius lived, whose rocky white 
profile had often excited my attention. Some 
sailors of bronzed hue, with red caps and striped 
shirts, took me there in a few hours, and put me 
on shore on a sandy beach, almost deserted. I 
mounted some steps cut out of the rock, a good 
deal broken, and invaded by vegetation in abun- 
dance, and came to the village, to the inn with 
the sign of 'the palm-tree, and left my little 
valise there. 

In great heat one has not much appetite, but 
dinner is a necessity, if only to prevent losing 
the habit. So I took a light repast under an ar- 
bour of vines, at the foot of some massive columns, 
between which were stretched out the flexible 



branches of figs. A tiger would have been tamed 
there, I am convinced, especially after moistening 
his lips with that beautiful golden wine with such 
a delicate bouquet that is made on the island. My 
collation finished, I left the inn on a voyage of 
discovery. 

The streets of Capri are narrow, considerably 
irregular, and bordered by houses with dome- 
shaped roofs, giving the place an Eastern appear- 
ance. I soon came to a tolerably large open 
space, and at the end was an arched doorway, 
leading to the country. Under this arch, at a 
small distance from the ground, was the aperture 
of a window, with iron bars. An old woman 
leant her elbows against it, conversing with a 
person of ragged beard and pale face, who could 
be seen behind the grating. 

This dark corner, where yet a man's friends 
could speak to him, was the public prison. 

When I came to this spot, I found two roads 
before me equally beautiful. The broadest on 
the right led to Anna Capri, a sort of eagle's 

 

nest on a high mountain; the other and less 
frequented road passed along the outside of the 
village, lined by hedges of prickly pear, aloes 
and vines winding among the rocks, and insen- 
sibly descending to the sea. 

I chose the latter for the sake of solitude, 
delaying at each step, now to watch a snake es- 
caping through the grass, now a butterfly rising 
in the air, now to glance at the beautiful country 
around me. Oh, how pleasant was the time I thus 
spent, and how often have I regretted it! 

At last I sat down on the root of a tree to 
dream at my ease, and give myself over to my 
feeling. Then I saw a living creature, about as 
large as a cockchafer, moving over the sand, 
an insect belonging to the tribe of dung-beetles, 
family Ateuchitse. She had found what she 
wanted, and was at work taking away some bits 
of it. Doubtless it was an unpleasant operation, 
but we will not be too sure on this point ; 
maternal love ennobles all with which it comes 
in contact. 



Our dung-beetle by her struggles contrived 
to make a little ball, and kneaded it carefully, 
mixing it with gravel. Then she dragged it to 
a small distance, turned her back to it, and 
began to roll it quickly over the ground, pushing 
it with her hind feet. The ball as it rolled 
gathered round it all the grains of sand that 
clung to its surface, and at last became of some 
size. All at once, when both its conductor and 
I least expected it, it rolled into a hole caused 
by the tread of a horse. 

The dung-beetle turned round sharply, waved 
her antennae, and rose up on her fore feet in 
the most comical way to get a better view of 
the neighbourhood around. Nothing was to be 
seen, north, south, east, or west. To her great 
astonishment, the ball had disappeared. Imme- 
diately she began to search in great haste, and 
at last discovered the object of her search in the 
situation we have mentioned. On seeing it she 
became calmer, though she was not entirely re- 
lieved from anxiety. She marched round the hole 



where her property lay, went down into it, ex- 
amined it carefully, and then making a buttress 
of herself, set to work to get it out. I saw her 
slowly ascending, with unheard-of labour, the 
almost perpendicular slope that she had to sur- 
mount, walking backwards and bearing all the 
weight of a heavy burthen. She had nearly 
done her work, when an unlucky motion all at 
once destroyed her balance and that of the ball, 
so that it fell into the pit along with her. 

This was a terrible misadventure ; so our in- 
sect remained motionless for a second, doubtless 
to take breath, as a good workman, who has 
failed in an arduous task, prepares to exert 
double strength and vigour. 

The ancient Greek poets, in their description 
of the realms of Pluto, picture to us there fierce 
Sisyphus painfully raising a rock, obliged to let 
it fall, seizing it again, and recommencing his 
dismal effort, without better success. They must 
have taken the notion from our poor insect, so 
sadly exercised, during its brief existence. See, 




she resumes her labour, but not, like Sisyphus, 
with a feeling of degradation. She has confidence 
in herself and succeeds. Her ball, vigorously 
pushed, rises and rises, at last scales the precipice, 
and rolls along the road. 

The dung-beetle takes courage, seeing it dis- 
engaged, and displays more zeal than ever. She 
resumes her backward travel, and easily traverses 
a distance of several feet. At last the ball 
escapes from her again, and is swallowed up in 
a crack in the ground. 

What a poem! No enamel orb mounted on 
a sovereign's sceptre ever gave so much trouble 
to its owner. 

But, thanks to chance, this time the famous 
ball had fallen into a good place. The insect, 
as far as I could judge by its demeanour, re- 
joiced at the result obtained. She searched 
around, went into the crack, cast wild looks 
to right and left, and seemed better and better 
satisfied at the examination. The eggs, hidden 
in the middle of the sphere that it was so 




difficult to place properly, were in a suitable 
position. They only had to be buried, and that 
was soon done. When the work was concluded, 
our beetle opened her wings, closed them, and 
extended them again ; taking flight over the 
grass, and soon disappearing in it. 

This is what I saw on a fine summer day 
on the high-road leading from the village of 
Capri to the sea. 




CHAPTER X. 

STILT WALKERS. 

A POWERFUL locomotive, driven by steam and 
heated by fire, advances with rapidity over the rails, 
but thought is still more rapid, easily outstrips 
it, and arrives first at the journey's end. With- 
out, having left our meadow, we have visited the 
rocks of Capri; we are now in the neighbour- 
hood of Bordeaux, traversing the Landes, that 
ocean of stones, sand, emaciated plants, and brush- 
wood. A shepherd walks steadily over the plain, 
with long stilts on his feet, and having in his 
hand an enormous pole terminated by a circular 
plate. 



When near us he stops, puts his pole to the 
ground, bends his knees, and sits down on the 
plate, looking like a dwarf stuck up on a gigantic 
tripod. In a country where the soil is shifting 
and insecure, it is well to take every precaution 
against accidents ; but at least, if we make use 
of an ingenious idea, we should leave the credit 
to the inventor and not appropriate it. 

Now, while the inhabitant of the Landes, 
proudly watching his sheep, is depicted by cele- 
brated painters, and boasts of the originality and 
strangeness of his style, the individual to whom 
he owes all his glory, of whose idea he has taken 
advantage, the real inventor of stilts, lives ob- 
scure and unknown in the branches of my old 
Pear-Tree. 

The fact is incontestable; indeed, here is the 
poor hero coming in his own person, not to 
recount his griefs to us, for he wants no pity, 
but to enjoy a beautiful spring day. His body 
is oval, very small, and like that of a spider. 
Head, neck, and abdomen are confused together, 




and he carries his eyes, two in number, on his 
back, where they are separated by a somewhat 
sharp crest. Like the shepherd of the Landes, 
he walks on real poles; that is to say, on legs 
of a remarkable length and fantastically slim. 
He has eight, but does not use them all at 
once. He generally raises some of them while 
he walks, holding them horizontally, as if he 
wanted to point to some distant object with his 
toe. We have just compared him to a spider : 
let us fancy that the threads of the spider's web 
were suddenly endued with life and motion, 
dragging, in their hasty march, the insect placed 
in their centre, and we shall have a notion of 
the shepherd spider, the unknown inventor of 
stilts. 

He feeds on the smallest creatures, whom he 
seizes by force of agility, or else at unawares. 
He may be seen any day, when the weather is 
not too bad, wandering 'on the old Pear-Tree, 
seeking his fortune, feeling over the mosses with 
his long legs. If he finds anything worthy of 



his desires, he lowers his body from the height 
at which it usually hangs, and clings to the 
bark of the tree to devour his prey. 

During my sleep in the meadow, he per- 
mitted me to witness a most curious spectacle. 
Eesting on a stalk of Ladies'-bed-straw at a short 
distance from me, he was taking care of bis per- 
son with the exactness of a fop. .Firmly fixed 
on his great stilts, he passed them one by one 
through his mouth, in order to make them bright 
and lustrous. 

The male shepherd-spiders engage in furious 
combats, and often leave some of their legs on 
the field of battle. Though these limbs are easily 
detached, they appear to be endowed with remarkable 
vitality, and continue in motion a long time after 
they are severed. This persistence in movement 
after amputation should not surprise us ; it is not 
peculiar to the shepherd-spider, but is also the 
case with most insects. Life, which in the organi- 
zation of man is centralized in force, is localized 
more and more in proportion as beings descend 



the scale. Thus in insects the blood is not en- 
closed in a system of special vessels ; they have 
neither veins nor arteries, and the nourishing fluid 
is distributed in the interstices that there are 
between the various organs. This uncertain and 
incomplete circulation is conducted by means of 
a simple canal situated at the centre of the body 
above the digestive tube. 

The system of nerves is not composed, as in 
man, of a cerebro-spinal axis, comprehending the 
larger and smaller brain and spinal marrow; but 
their nerves are distributed in little centres called 
ganglions, apart from each other. Thus it may 
be perceived, that if one of these centres be de- 
stroyed, the others can act for some time indepen- 
dently. There are animals also of a still more 
rudimentary structure, as, for instance, the polyps, in 
which the various faculties of relative life are not 
peculiar to any special organ ; but all their parts 
possess isolated sensation and power of motion. 

The more Nature is studied, the greater is the 
admiration of her inexhaustible fruitfulness. We 



have hardly lost sight of the shepherd-spider 
flying over the meadow on his long legs, before 
here comes another stilt walker the Daddy-long- 
legs or Tailor - crane - fly, whose aspect is more 
strange than a dream could devise. It has a 
narrow and slender body very much resembling 
that of his cousin, though much larger. His mouth 
is split from front to rear, and composed of two 
lips, not placed one above the other, but side by 
side, one on the outside, the other on the inside. 
This mouth is situated at the extremity of a short 
trunk, which terminates an already lengthy head, 
adorned also with two gills. 

The colours of our tipula are not brilliant, 
being a whitish grey, and the corselet rising into 
a most inelegant humpback. True, he has two 
superb eyes, and that is saying something for him. 
Were beauty reduced to regular and harmonious 
outlines, it would be cold and statue-like, but 
fine eyes give it radiance and light it up. The 
eye of the tipula consists of a network of a 
changeable green; a careful observer would even 



discover a little purple in it. The wings are 
transparent, somewhat narrow, and generally held 
far apart. The antennae are not remarkable except 
for four or five great hairs of whose functions we 
are quite ignorant. 




I Whence com.es this new semi-grotesque person- 
age, whom we must add to the already numerous 
gallery of the guests of the old Pear-Tree ? Where 
is she going, perched on her great legs, running 
like the ostrich, and fanning her wings to quicken 


her speed ? See, she stops at the foot of a cavern 
that time has excavated in the trunk of the tree. 
At the bottom of this dark and gaping cavern 
is a humid soil formed of rotting vegetable matter. 
The tipula goes in and takes up a most curious 
attitude ; raises her head, stands as high as possible 
on her stilts, and at last places her body in a 
perpendicular attitude. The two hind legs are now 
the only ones that touch the ground. She looks 
as if going to dance a minuet with some invisible 
being in the hollow of the Pear-Tree. 

Yet there is no one, and the poor thing would 
certainly be far from supposing the solemn cour- 
tesies of this dance manifestations of pleasure. 
The head is full of other matters than amusement, 
and, like the dung-beetle of Capri, her prime 
thought is of duty. She brings to the ground 
her long tail composed of four scaly pieces, making 
two pairs of pincers of different lengths, and digs 
it in with great vigour. Then the two pairs of 
pincers open and allow two or three eggs to 
escape, which remain in the hole bored by the 





tipula. These eggs are perfectly black, and look 
like little polished grains of gunpowder. They 







are oblong, and curved into a crescent shape. Each 
female lays hundreds ; and so proceeds sowing her 
progeny and piercing the earth at each step. 




When the eggs are laid, each soon becomes 
full of grubs of a very dirty white, cylindrical 
in form, except that the two ends are smaller 
than the middle of the body. The head is scaly, 
and not at all large. The insect does not often 
display more than a portion of it, and when 
taken in the hand retracts its front part within 
the 'first ring. The tortoise evidently has play- 
mates even among the smallest species. 

The larvae of the crane fly cause great ravages 
in grass land by moving the earth round the 
roots of the plants, Which are thereby disturbed, 
lifted up, and exposed to be dried by the sun. 
Indeed they sometimes cut the .fibres in making 
their galleries. The manner in which they receive 
their supply of oxygen is worthy of notice. They 
have a complete respiratory apparatus at the end 
of their body, composed of a bunch of radiating 
filaments and performing the office of true lungs. 

It is not necessary to say that these rudimen- 
tary creatures do not immediately exchange the 
obscure life that they pass in their caves for that 



of a free winged fly flitting over the grass and 
newly -blown flowers. In order to arrive at that 
condition, our grubs, like caterpillars, dispense with 
their skin, and live for some time under the form 
of nymphse rigidly swaddled up. They are then 
of a grey colour. Their future wings and antennae 
are hidden under the abdomen, as well as the 
legs, all in order and close together. These legs, 
destined to be so greatly developed in future, are 
folded and doubled so as to take up the least 
room possible. 

This is an example of the different means 
employed by nature to accomplish the same end. 
The nympha of the crane fly at the time of its 
transformation must by degrees raise itself to the 
surface of the ground and disengage its front 
part. How is this to be accomplished, as the 
legs are not only bent down, but enclosed in a 
solid covering ? 

The difficulty is resolved in the most remark- 
able manner. The insect's body, though smooth 
in the grub, in the nympha bristles with bumps 


and spines. There are some on all the rings, but 
more on those near the tail. These spines slope 
downwards ; some are single, some forked. And 
it is by their means that the creature, feeling 
ready for its entrance into another world, drags 
itself with great effort towards the light. 




Crane flies, like all insects which multiply with 
rapidity, and whose females lay great numbers 
of eggs, are greedily pursued and destroyed in 
great quantities by birds, our most valuable assist- 



ants, without whom we should have much trouble 
in evading the ravages of insects. Some inter- 
esting facts will prove this. 

A naturalist one day took a butterfly that 
comes from a hairy caterpillar, and obtained from 
it a brood of three hundred and fifty eggs, which 
all hatched. He kept eighty eggs and brought 
up the caterpillars. All performed their changes 
and became perfect insects, except five which died 
in the act of changing their skin. Among all 
these butterflies there were fifteen females coming 
from the eighty eggs ; the brood of three hundred 
and fifty wou]d then in proportion have furnished 
sixty-five females. Supposing that they had been 
as fruitful as their mother, we come in the third 
generation to a sum of twenty-two thousand seven 
hundred and fifty caterpillars, among whom there 
would have been at least four thousand two hun- 
dred and sixty-five females, and they would have 
produced in their turn one million four hundred 
and ninety-two thousand seven hundred and fifty 
grubs. These numbers are sufficiently oppressive ; 




but certainly viviparous flies will show us much 
larger ones. They produce as many as twenty-two 
thousand at a single birth. For these, supposing 
the number of females equal to that of males, we 
shall have at the third step not a miserable million 
of individuals, but a splendid posterity of two 
thousand decillions of beings, all living, flying, and 
eating at the universal board. 

At the end of a generation they would have 
eaten us down to the bare boards, and there would 
be no place left for us at the feast. 



CHAPTER XL 

FKOM THE MEADOW TO THE WILDERNESS. 

THE slope that rises a tew steps from the great 
Pear-Tree, half in sun, half in shade, is as popu- 
lous as a hive of bees. A builder is at work 
there at this moment, and is building a novel sort 
of mansion there. If he was of our race, there 
would be little about him in which to interest 
ourselves. "We should most likely see him imi- 
tating some Greek temple, endeavouring to renew 
Roman art, inspired with Gothic taste, or sensibly 
copying some edifice of the Renaissance. By com- 
mon consent, architecture is a dead language at 
present, only to be studied in ancient authors. By 



the employment of iron, so wonderfully worked at 
the present day in turn with zinc and glass, some 
rash adventurers have endeavoured to raise edifices 
full of elegance and lightness, but in a style 
unknown to Vitruvius ; but it seems as if their 
deeds had been scandalous, and that such efforts 
ought not to be encouraged. 

The builder that we are going to discuss is a 
simple insect, with only his instinct to guide him, 
and yet indulging at times in original efforts. It 
is a grey larva, with a body of oval shape, covered 
with little tubercles. It can only walk back- 
wards, and bears in front of his head a pair of 
jagged pincers, sharp, and hollow within. These 
pincers supply the place of mouth, proboscis, and 
offensive weapons. There are several tools, but he 
wants them all ; for he is at once workman, 
mechanic, and soldier. He has just set to work, 
and we can study his smallest movements at 
leisure. 

Like a prudent insect, he begins by examining 
the surface of the ground, in order to make choice 





of a suitable position. After some hesitation he 
fixes on a somewhat sandy flat, a few inches across, 
about half-way up the slope. He levels it a little, 
clears out the rubbish, then digging his tail into 
the ground, he traces a perfect circle by using the 
point of one of his pincers as a compass, and the 
end of his tail for a centre-point. He then begins 
to dig in this space, heaps a quantity of sand on 




his head, and, by giving a good shake, casts the 
burthen outside the circle. He then continues to 
work for some minutes, turning round and round 
and walking backwards. When returned to the 
point of departure, he changes sides. Mountains 
are moved by courage and perseverance, and d 
fortiori why may not holes be dug ? So our builder 
by dint of labour constructs a large funnel with 



its point, about two inches deep. Then he takes 
up his position at the bottom of this cavity, buries 
himself there, only showing his pair of pincers 
extended and open at the bottom of the pit, and 
perfectly motionless. 

What is his expectation as he lies concealed in 
darkness and mystery ? His name will sufficiently 
declare his object. He is called the. Ant Lion. 

Yes, indeed, with justice. The very ants that 
climb so impudently over my body as I lie in 
the grass, have a most formidable enemy, who 
scrunches them up all standing, in despite of the 
desperate resistance they make. After all, what 
is there to wonder at in his manners and customs ? 
Considering that the whale, that giant denizen of 
the sea, is vanquished by the attacks of man, of 
sharks, of saw-fish, of sword-fish, of seals, and of 
white bears, it may be inferred that the ant 
cannot escape being exposed to some mischance. 
There can be no conqueror without a combat, and 
the issue of encounters is not always fortunate. 
According to Homer, Achilles himself had a vul- 



nerable heel, and yet none buTT, i.e. 
the next thing to a demigod, can help failing, not 
only in one but in both feet. 

If by chance an ant running by should fall 
into the hole that her enemy has dug, she is im- 
mediately seized in his pincers and pitilessly de- 
voured. If as she roils down she tries to cling to 
the sides of the funnel, the adversary rains sand 
upon her to hasten her fall. The ant lion is not 
the only employer of this generally successful 
stratagem ; some fishes do the same. The lot of 
the archer, an inhabitant of the Ganges, is to 
feed on insects : yet he cannot issue from the 
water to catch them in the fields of air. This 
industrious insect counsels him to hide against 
the bank till an incautious fly comes to perch 
among the aquatic weeds. The instant the victim 
is observed, a spout of water is cast at him, and 
carries him down into the river. The archer seems 
seldom to miss his aim, even at a distance of 
several feet. 



To return to the ant lion, by the way, we 
may observe he has no objection to a change of 
diet. Every insect of medium size that is attracted 
to his pit by curiosity gets into trouble. Even 
one of his own kind, if he got his foot in them 
by chance, would not be spared. Patient waiting 
for hours for a good meal makes any one savage. 

When the time for transformation is come, our 
larva, now arrived at his full growth, goes back- 
wards and forwards, tracing irregular furrows in 
the ground, and spins himself a round cocoon, 
covered with sand outside, and inside hung with 
fine white silk. Within this cocoon it changes 
into a nymph, and may there be seen curled into 
a circle, motionless, and calmly awaiting the mo- 
ment of deliverance. 

The perfect insect is very long, and a good 
deal like the dragon-fly. It has four great wings, 
with very numerous and delicate nervures. It lays 
its reddish-white eggs in a sandy and very dry 
soil, in some spot protected from the rain, or at 
the foot of an old wall with a southern exposure. 





However remarkable is the voracity of the 
ant lion, it is not equal to that of many other 
insects. All are equally ravenous on issuing from 
the egg. They fling themselves on their prey, 
gorge on it to satiety, go to sleep, and only wake 




to eat again. A naturalist has remarked that 
the larva of a fly, the Musca carnaria, or blow- 
fly, in twenty-four hours becomes two hundred 
times as heavy as at first. The raisers of silk- 
worms have made similar inquiries, and proved 



that the caterpillars hatched from one ounce of 
eggs eat sixteen hundred and nine mulberry leaves 
before reaching the perfect state. This enormous 
consumption of eatables is necessary to the larvae, 
as they must lay in a store of sustenance to be 
able to bear the long fast they undergo in the 
state of chrysalis, or nympha. Their stomacli 
changes with their nature. The greedy silkworm 
that consumed a mass of green leaves sixty 
thousand times its own weight, when become a 
moth only takes a little honey by way of nourish- 
ment. The digestive organs of the first had very 
great power ; those of the second are reduced to 
the thickness of a thread. 

It is not always so. But two paces from the 
ant lion's pit, among my Pear-Tree's roots, there 
has lain for some time a mass of eggs, united 
by a fine membrane, from which there issued 
a swarm of little larvae. These of course had 
neither wings nor wing-covers, but even from this 
early period their possession at a future day might 
be predicted, judging by four protuberances, like 


buttons, that project from their segments. The 
creatures dispersed at the foot of the slope, ate 
the grass, made their transformations, and we now 
see them skipping joyously around us in shape of 
grasshoppers. 

The ravages inflicted by caterpillars are trifling 
compared to the terrible devastations caused by 
the larvae of the locust, one of the varieties of 
that numerous family whose destroying march has 
been described most forcibly by Oriental poets.* 

A column of fire goeth before them, and a 
burning flame folio we th them. Before them ex- 
tends a rich country like the Garden of Eden, 
behind can only be seen a desert of bare mon- 
strous outlines, an ocean of stones and sand. Yes, 
nothing can escape them. The clash of their 
wings resound afar like that of the war chariot 
drawn by horses, at the moment when it dashes 
into the combat, ploughing its bloody track through 
the thickest. They pass over the tops of the hills 
like flame flying and crackling over lands covered 



with stubble, or like armed legions going to the 
war. Before them men shudder and feel their 
countenance turn pale. They march in innumer- 
able quantities, always going forward, keeping 
their rank, and confident in their strength. 

A learned traveller, Dr. Shaw, was present at 
one of these invasions in Algeria, and has given 
a most curious picture of it. The grasshoppers 
appeared at the end of March, and their numbers 
increased to such a pitch that in the following 
month their swarms when taking flight interrupted 
the light of the sun. At the beginning of May 
they retired into the Mitidjah and other neigh- 
bouring plains to lay their eggs. No sooner were 
they hatched than the young larvae banded together 
and marched in a compact army in the direction 
of the sea, leaving all perfectly bare wherever 
their legions appeared. They were indefatigable ; 
climbed trees, scaled walls, entered houses, and 
appeared to spring from the ground. Meanwhile 
the inhabitants had taken measures of defence ; 
they dug immense trenches around the gardens 


and fields, and filled them with water to several 
feet in depth. Piles of fuel had been prepared to 
be fired on the arrival of the destroying column. 

It came, made a bridge of the dead by which 
it passed the ditches, put out the fires by delivering 
over to them heaps of victims to be consumed, 
and continued its triumphant course. Other bands 
followed this first army, then still more, spreading 
around them misery, famine, and death. 

Ha'ving continued for a month this aggressive 
and persecuted existence, the larvae had reached 
their full growth and become perfect. In order 
to perform this change they attached themselves 
by their legs to a branch, or, failing that, to .any 
projecting object, and shook themselves so <0ften 
and so well as to disentangle themselves of their 
old useless skin. This laborious task lasted from 
seven to eight minutes, and was followed by an 
almost complete prostration. Nevertheless, they 
might be seen to revive as soon as the action of 
the sun and air had dried their wings, to shake 
their antennae, and spring forth more voracious 

 

than ever with fresh powers and greater activity. 
It is difficult to form an idea of the swarms of 
locusts that invaded Africa in the year 1797. 
An English naturalist, Mr. Barrow, who could 
judge with his own eyes, reports that these 
insects covered an area of country two thou- 
sand square miles in extent. The current of a 
large river in which grew some reeds was entirely 
stopped by the heaps of their bodies. Having 
mown down everything in the neighbourhood, 
the surviving green rushes on the bank had excited 
their desires, and they perished by myriads in 
trying to obtain them. 

When the locusts begin on a field of corn, they 
attack the ears first, and pluck out grain after 
grain ; then they devour the stalk, afterwards the 
leaves, and only stop when they come down to the 
surface of the ground. Once on the march, these 
larvae never stop, and their direction is determined 
by that of the wind. At sunset the immense 
army halts and divides into small detachments 
that take possession of plants, of tufts of grass, ant- 




hills, and stores, and pass the night there. Then it is 
that attempts are made to destroy them by driving 
great flocks of sheep over the spots where they 
are encamped, and incredible quantities are crushed. 

If the wind brings them, the storm also carries 
them away. Certain coast districts of Africa, 
where they multiplied with frightful rapidity, were 
delivered in this manner. A current of air from 
the north-west raised them in compact masses and 
swept them into the sea. Their bodies covered the 
coast, and composed a bank three or four feet high 
and extending nearly fifty miles. Terrible in their 
lives, they were yet more so after death, and for a 
rtime it was feared that the plague would succeed 
'to famine. 

loa our temperate climates the grasshoppers are 
not animated by such a rabid thirst for destruction. 
It required the burning emanations of a tropical 
sun and the acid fire of the desert to fling them 
thus on nature. Yet at times the locusts do unite 
in bands in Italy. They commence their travels at 
early dawn after the dew is dried up. Some of 



them spring up in the ranks, awake their sleeping 
comrades, and seem to act as messengers. Soon 
they all set out on their march, all in the same 
direction and without great deviations. Though 
very near together they never come in contact, 
and travel nearly as fast as a fly running on the 
ground without making use of its wings. If pur- 
sued or attacked on the march, they disperse, to 
assemble anew a little further off. They travel thus 
till evening without stopping, advancing about nine 
feet in the day. Though they in general prefer to 
follow the great roads and beaten paths, when they 
meet with brushwood, hedges, or ditches, they do 
not turn from their way, but seek to surmount 
these obstacles. Marshes, rivers, or canals turn 
them aside to take another direction, unless they 
manage to cross them on a bridge of reeds, or by 
making use of the bushy branches that overhang 
the water. Towards sunset they encamp, like their 
African relatives. They do not move during rain, 
or while the sky is cloudy. When their wings are 
developed they separate a little from each other, 



still, however, keeping together and advancing in 
numerous swarms. 

Locusts invaded England in the year 1748, 
but without breeding there. They were seen also 
in Poland and Lithuania, where they appeared 
in sufficient numbers to darken the air. Trees 
with long and flexible branches bent under their 
weight. Our locusts, with their erratic and dis- 
orderly habits, were sure to obtain the attention 
of the magistrates ; so we find several provisions 
that concern them. The jurisconsults questioned : 
What if a farmer by contract having renounced 
making any kind of accident a plea for avoiding 
the payment of his rent, should see his harvest 
devoured by grasshoppers ? Should he bear the 
loss, or the landed proprietor be charged with it ? 
This question wa,s the subject of a Latin thesis of 
Joachim Hoppius : De edaci locustorum pernicie, 
a L. Excepto lempore E. Local, et conduct. It 
may be discovered in some old libraries, where we 
will let it repose in peace until such time as our 
own fields be mown down by locusts. 



CHAPTER XII. 

A VINDICATION. 

IF there is a maligned, calumniated, slandered 
insect, it is the one who has planted her home 
before us, under a stone at the foot of the great 
Pear-Tree, at a very short distance from a superb 
tuft of camomile. 

It is true that her appearance does not give 
a favourable impression. Her head is brown, 
corselet flat and black, with paler edges. The 
wing-cases are very short, and make her look 
like a man who has lost his arms. She is awk- 
ward, inelegant, and seems only to have stumps 

for wing-cases. The body is terminated by a 
long pair of pincers, of hard substance, curved 
into an arch, with the points touching. She is 
known by the significant name of Forficula, or 
Earwig. If she comes into our sight when going 
about her business, she usually forfeits her life 
for her imprudence. The learned have taken much 
pains in pleading her cause, and endeavouring to 
convince people that it would be very injurious 
to the Forficula to live inside a skull, all the more 
so that there are plenty of hot brains in the 
world. The anatomists have made common cause 
with naturalists, and borne witness to the im- 
possibility of such an entrance being effected 
into our bony case, perfectly closed at the point 
of the ear ; but they are not listened to. Ento- 
mologists, thinking that they could put an end to 
the question, added that the insect's pincers were 
not strong enough to produce the slightest im- 
pression. Their simplicity is derided. 

A single word only is required to create a preju- 
dice ; millions may be spoken without confuting it. 


At least thus much justice may be granted to 
the earwig, as to allow that it is full of devotion 
to its larvae, not abandoning them till they are 
of an age to make their own way in the world. 
If we raise the stone under which she has taken 
shelter, we shall find her there surrounded by her 
family. She only robs us from time to time 
of some fruit, makes a hole in a ripe pear, and 
buries herself in it like an open-mouthed glutton. 
Open fields are preferred by her, wet sand, the 
margins of ponds, and shady gardens. Her life 
is peaceful, calm, and rural ; but this does not 
prevent her being considered as odious. 

Near her lives one of her relations, having 
like her an elongated body, filiform antennae, wings 
hidden under disproportionately small coverts, and 
likewise a great bull-dog head, with jaws pro- 
jecting to right and left in a most menacing 
fashion. It is the great black Staphyllinus,* of 
agile limbs, and of sharp, teasing temper. He 
searches for decaying animal matter, and throws 



himself on living insects, and his voracity even 
induces him to commit Staphyllinophagy ; that is 
to say, to eat his own fellows. 

Yet this individual, though his habits are sus- 
picious, does not excite any repugnance. It is 
true that he raises his head at the least attack, 
brandishing his tail as if he had a terrible sting 




in it ; while the poor earwig, if it falls into an 
ant-hill, or under the foot of man, tries to escape 
at its utmost speed, without having an idea of 
making use of those famous pincers that have made 
her so many enemies. 

Another unfortunate, more abject and miserable 
still, composed of rings soldered one to the other, 



with naked body, shiny, tapering to a point in 
front, and a dweller underground, is moving a 
short distance off. The approach of a mole makes 
it hastily quit its obscure hole ; and here it is 
crawling through the grass, turning and twisting 
as if suffering from a spasm, as it feels the warm 
rays of the sun upon its cold skin. It is the 
Lumbricus, or Earth-worm. 

It hates the glare of day, the blue sky, and 
balmy breeze. What it likes is the great grey 
cloud heavily driving over the horizon, shedding 
torrents of rain on its course, washing the leaves 
and moistening the branches, distributing all around 
great puddles of muddy water. Then it protrudes 
half its body from its den, raises itself painfully 
to some flower bent down by the storm, drags it 
to the orifice of a deep hole soiled with mire and 
discoloured, and then slowly devours it. 

Only just sufficient for this are its organs 
The first segment of the body is a little prolonged, 
and answers for an upper lip. The next ring has 
a border, above which is a narrow opening. Such 


is the mouth. The nervous system is very little 
developed, and consists of a chain of very small 
ganglions, distributed from one end of the body 
to the other. It presents hardly any individuality, 
and each one unites the two sexes. The eggs are 
vesicles, with horny shell, oval or elongated. 

We only meet it with a gesture of repugnance, 
and yet this wretched earth-worm is beautiful, if 
only beauty consists in the perfect harmony of 
different organs, and the complete adaptation to 
the medium in which they are to be employed. But 
how can we get this definition admitted, especially 
among painters ? Let us study the pictures of the 
greatest masters, and what shall we find there but 
that each one's ideal is the face of their own kind, 
chastened by thought, embellished by fancy, re- 
fined by meditation ? The earth-worm must be 
resigned to be considered ugly till it too gets 
knowledge .how to wield the pencil and the brush. 

It has both already, and no need of instru- 
ments. I see from here, thanks to my double 
eight, eight stiff, short-hooked bristles under each 



of its rings. Their direction is from front to rear, 
and at the top of each is a pore. They are em- 
ployed as feet for want of better, when it is com- 
pelled to quit its underground gallery and seek 
adventures on the high road. 

If new proofs were wanted of the injustice of 
certain generally-received opinions, we should find 
them, and in plenty, without leaving the old Pear- 
Tree. There is one of its population that children 
look for under the name of Lady-bird, or Lady- 
cow, known scientifically by the appellation of 
Coccinella, a round, smooth, brilliant, lustrous 
bead, adorned with a black head, set off with two 
little white spots. Besides, she is marked with 
seven dark marks disposed triangularly, and fault- 
lessly regular. Nothing can be prettier, and one 
would hesitate to do the least harm to this charm- 
ing little thing, so exceedingly well enamelled. It 
ought to live, it would seem, only on the pollen 
of flowers, mingled with a little dew. 

We must not trust it. Do you see that great 
grub, long and grey, bedaubed with black and 






white, crawling among the plant lice and tearing 
them up with its horny jaws ? The vital juice 
flows around it in drops, and it kills whatever it 
touches. The author of all these murders, so coolly 




perpetrated all along her track, is the innocent 
Lady-bird in the first phase of her existence. 

When gorged upon the swarming population 
around her till no more can be swallowed, she 




clings to a leaf with the end of her tail, an er 
skin stretches like the cloth of a bag that is too 
full. Gradually the circulation in it becomes less 
active, and this outer skin stiffens, and forms a 
species of cocoon, whence this living bead at last 
issues, of whom people say that she must be re- 
spected as never having done harm to any one. 

Poor earwig ! unfortunate worm ! why have 
they not the impertinence of the Coach-horse, or 
the credit of the Lady-bird ? Certainly it is not 
from man that they have learnt the lesson of 
humility and modesty. From the time he put in an 
appearance here below, he made the earth that he 
inhabits the centre of the universe, and himself 
the point of attraction to everything in this world. 
Believe him, and stones, plants, animals, every- 
thing, have only been created with a view to his 
employment of them. This theory still numbers 
many votaries, and would be pleasing to me also 
did not some facts stand in singular opposition 
to it. These are sometimes embarrassing ; so we 
will pass our opinion on them. 

 

It is not to be denied that great numbers of 
insects pillage and ravage our fields, attack us 
at home at our very hearths, and cause us an 
immensity of damage. They perforate our fur- 
niture, wander in our libraries, make nests in 
wardrobes, go from one room to another, and 
leave everywhere visible traces of their stay. 
They devour our corn, gnaw our fruit, destroy 
the plants of the kitchen garden, disturb our 
rest, prick us, wound us, bite us, and persecute 
us in a thousand ways. 

Indeed it must be confessed that these are 
strange sort of auxiliaries, and their ways would 
excite reflection did not the ingenuity of man 
find an answer for all. 

It says : " They have received life in order 
to punish us for our crimes, and are employed 
by Heaven to scourge our vices." 

This explanation is good, but I prefer another 
that I owe to a flight of birds that alighted on 
my old tree with ever-moving wings and un- 
closed beak. This troop, which had assembled 


to pursue some late flying owl, comprised titmice, 
chaffinches, hedge sparrows, and even linnets. 

All these birds twittered, whistled, and sang, 
in different tongues. Each one had his favourite 
notes, his peculiar scale, and his own warble. 
Some strung together two or three sharp and 
shrill notes without pretension ; others rose on 
their little legs and made a display of rolling 
trills. 

And -strange it was that the difference of all 
these tones raised at once over the mead was not 
at all disagreeable. They .melted one into the 
other, and constituted an indefinable harmony, 
rather \vague, but full of charm. 

And 'hearing them, I said : " There are in 
this world beings of all kinds, unequal in power 
and intelligence, according as more or less 
deeply penetrated by divine breath. They have a 
common bond in their origin, and obey the same 
general laws. They are frequently in accordance, 
they are constantly in connexion, but all have 
their individual destiny, their own development, 



and peculiar transformations. One has not been 
created for another, and none of them, not even 
man, is a centre of light and heat. The sun 
that lights and warms them, the real source of 
life, blazes far from them all above their heads 
in the immeasurable height of the skies. Our 
philosophers and sages, stammering in the lan- 
guage of truth, have modelled creation at the will 
of their conceit ; but fruitful mother Nature re- 
veals to them another principle, based on love, 
the undefined striving of beings for perfection, 
the constant aspiration of all that exists towards 
a better state. In varied forms, sthas aspiration 
increases ,as it ascends in the scale, till at last 
it loses itself where our gaze cannot follow it, 
in that Infinite Supreme Eternal Unity, before 
whom the intellect of man is nothing but un- 
certainty and confusion." 

So let us forgive the earth-worm's disagreeable 
appearance and the lady-bird's sanguinary customs. 

Besides, the latter is really charming, and 
seems like a waif from a jeweller's workshop. 


Some of them are red, with two great white 
marks on the sides : these are found on the alder ; 
some scarlet, with five black round spots ; others 
again in scarlet clothing, but with a yellow corselet 
and marked with thirteen black dots : these last 
live on the wych-elm. One of the largest, the 
Coccinella Argus, is all red below as well as above, 
head and breast of one same colour. On each 
wing-cover may be seen five dark spots, both sides 
exactly alike, and there is an eleventh at the 
junction of the wings. These spots are round 
and black, with a yellow rim, different from the 
colour of the wing-cases, and look like so many 
ever open eyes disposed over the creature's whole 
body. 

It may be supposed that this brilliant per- 
sonage is somewhat scarce, and does not often 
favour us with her presence. She lives on bushes 
in the open country where the air is good and 
plant-lice fat and numerous. 

A. striped and very pretty Coccinella is found 
on flowers, but yet less curious than another 


variety of the same family also an inhabitant 
of flowers. This has a real chessboard on its 
back. We should never finish if we tried to 
describe all that there are in collections. 

There are lady-birds gilded and silvered, and 
purple, striped with these different hues. Indeed, 
some of them are shaggy and crossed by two 
great red bands. I have seen some that crawled 
on branches like little tortoises on earth, with 
a sharp projecting margin all round their wing- 
covers. Nature is prodigal, inexhaustible, and 
never counts the jewels in her casket. 




CHAPTER XIII. 

THE OBSEQUIES OF A FIELD MOUSE. 

EVERY one knows the town rat, that impudent 
guest always ready to hold festival at another's 
table, and who even has the hardihood to invite 
some of his long-moustached friends who, like 
himself, may be moving about in search of food 
at night, with the stomach more active than the 
conscience. The country rat is also possessed of 
a certain notoriety, thanks to La Fontaine. Some- 
times he is found in farms sleeping on bundles 
of straw like a real vagabond, constantly hunted 
by the cats, those volunteer members of the rural 





police. Both of them, the town rat and the 
country rat, are of very marked style, to which 
Callot has done justice. 




They are mendicants, and well contented so 
to be. Such is not their cousin the field mouse, 





whose curious history came to my knowledge in 
my meadow. 

The cousin in question is of small stature, 




and does not measure much more than three 
inches from the tip of his nose to the root of 
his tail. His head is large, nibbler that he is, 



and his muzzle blunt. His cutting teeth are 
very yellow, and as for his molars, they have a 
fla,t crown furrowed transversely on it very much 
like those of the elephant. His ear is small, a 
mark of good birth, and is well clothed in fur. 
The eyes project and are very sharp, and the 
tail is in part without fur. The upper part of 
the body is a mingled tint of brown and black, 
the stomach of a very dark ash-coloured grey. 

Our field mouse, far from passing a miserable 
existence like his congeners, always finds means 
of living in opulence. In the month of August, 
when the ears of corn ripen and cover the plain 
afar with golden masses, he scampers before the 
labourer, cuts the wheat-stalks, gnaws the fattest 
grains, and so takes his tithe of the harvest. 
Later he mixes with the gleaners, and knows 
better than they how to swell his sheaf. When 
the land is bared, and there are nothing but lean 
pipes of stubble to be found, he moves a few steps 
away to newly-sown fields. What a treasure 
is a rich furrow fall of grain left free to his 



appetite ! If this resource fails, lie goes into en- 
closed meads to destroy the roots of grass and 
plants, or pays a visit to gardens and orchards. 
In winter, when driven by the snow from open 
fields, he frequents the woods full of acorns and 
beech-nuts. In time of absolute fast his measures 
are soon taken, for he falls upon the weakest of his 
neighbours, were it even on another field mouse, 
tearing him to pieces and eating him up. 

This is what is called bending to circum- 
stances and knowing what one is about ! Who 
would not wish to be a field mouse, even though 
naturally a bit of a rat already. 

To great activity in destruction and much 
agility, the cunning creature adds the disastrous 
quality of multiplying prodigiously. He and his 
family sometimes establish considerable colonies, 
extending in a short time over several square 
leagues. The female brings forth twice a year 
in our climate, in spring and summer, ten or 
twelve little ones. Farther north, where the pine 
takes the place of oak and beech, its fecundity 



is not so great, and only displayed once a year, 
during the last days of April. 

The field mouse makes for himself under- 
ground retreats, whither he flies at the smallest 
sign of danger, like the classical brigands of Spain 
or Italy. These retreats serve him at once as 
abode and storehouse. They are not very spacious, 
it is true, nor burrowed very deeply into the 
earth, but yet they provide a secure retreat, and 
are generally divided into two or three chambers. 
The galleries occupied by different families are 
not contiguous ; between tten a greater or less 
space always remains. If the occupants of these 
underground chambers leave them or die, no 
others take up their abode there. New comers 
prefer to work for themselves further off for 
their own use, and despise the labours of another. 
None of them generally dig deeper than six 
inches or a foot, but often the females, before 
producing their young, prolong the excavation to 
even two feet deep, by a gallery, hardly an inch 
in size, that after several windings opens on a 



kind of chamber provided with a soft lining of 
dry grass ; and on this downy couch the brood 
are born. 

The stout farmer, joint owner of my meadow, 
had declared war to the death against all this 
race, harshly calling them vermin. He had been 
told that leaves of alder spread on the field and 
ploughed in would drive away the field mice, 
and had tried it : a useless labour, for next year 
his enemies were more numerous than ever. 
Exasperated by want of success, he sowed in 
his orchard and on his land a quantity of oats 
steeped in a solution of arsenic. ' This method 
answered indeed only too well, for many fowls, 
and the best of layers, were killed as well as our 
indefatigable devourers. This was no true suc- 
cess for our friend : though victorious, he paid the 
expenses of the war. So he changed his tactics, 
took spurge-laurel (Daphne tliymelcea), which is 
poisonous only to certain animals, pounded it in 
a mortar to extract the juice, soaked grains of 
corn in it, and distributed them under bits of 




tile which he placed about in the fields. This 
time his triumph was complete : a swarm of field 
mice perished in mortal convulsions, and one of 
them who had been used to come regularly for 
three years to eat the peas in my meadow, was 
there panting before my eyes, ready to yield up his 
last breath. I was a witness to his final struggle, 
and saw him gradually grow fixed into that 
icy, immovable rigidity which is the companion 
of death. 

There he was, by the side of the Pear-Tree 
where he had before passed such pleasant hours, 
upside down on the saoad, with his feet in the air, 
muzzle .contracted, and glassy eye. I expected to 
see a legion of ants .arrive those fellows who are 
so clever at cutting up a body and laying the 
skeleton bare without dislocating a joint, when 
a strange sound rang around me, grave and pro- 
longed like the great bell of Notre Dame. An 
insect had just passed about an inch from my 
ear and pitched down on the field mouse. 

It was a little smaller than a dung-beetle, but 



longer and much more active. As for his attire, 
it was in complete conformity with his business : 
head, body, and corselet black, with some yellow 
hairs on them ; wing-cases or upper wings 
divided by two yellow cross bands with broken 
outlines ; curious antennae, with a reddish mass at 
the end formed of four small plates ranged on 
one another by the middle, and the last was 
thicker, and in the shape of a little irregular 
pointed button. In a word, he wore the true 
garb of a fashionable undertaker, grave, dark, 
and handsome. 

The field mouse had no -cause for complaints of 
anybody but his enemy the stout farmer. Nature 
sent him, as soon as his decease was duly regis- 
tered, a gravedigger with good large legs, skilful 
in excavating ground, and carrying all his topis 
with him to finish the job as soon as possible. 
The Necropliorus vespillo for so is this curious 
individual named does not work, however, with- 
out pay. He has some eggs to lay before he 
himself passes from life to death, and proposes to 


bury them with the body. Flesh-feeding larvae 
will spring from them, and they will perform 
after several metamorphoses the duties first per- 
formed for them. Behold our burying beetle 
taking a tour round the field mouse, inspecting the 
field of operations, and finding the earth friable, 
light, and but little hardened. Could there be any- 
thing easier for an experienced gravedigger than 
to make a hole in it ? But how transport the 
body to it when, made ? It was clear enough 
that the power of the burying beetle was not 
sufficient. "Without being a Goliath, or even a 
David, a field mouse weighs something, and our 
undertaker has not much more than good-will. 
No, I am wrong ; he is endued with a marvellous 
instinct. 

Having finished his inspection, he stops a 
moment to take time to reflect. During this 
interval we observe a special peculiarity the 
massive, square, powerful form of his corselet. 
Doubtless there is good reason for it, for this is 
what enables the insect to push its head under 



the mouse, slightly raising it, and to slip between 
the body and the surface of the ground so as 
nearly to disappear from our eyes. He stops there 
for a long time, and we begin to lose patience. 
What can he be doing in this inconvenient posi- 
tion, crushed under a weight disproportioned to 
his strength ? Does he wish to try to carry the 
rodent, in spite of the evident folly of the attempt ? 
No, he does not even dream of it. He has 
just simply excavated the ground under the field 
mouse, and it sinks slowly but with steady pro- 
gress into the moving sand. I still distinguish 
his muzzle, with his ornaments of long grey mous- 
taches ; then it sinks, and shows itself in profile, 
gets smaller, and disappears for ever ; very soon 
the feet alone of the dead animal project from 
the surface of the meadow; they sink and sink, 
and are in their turn covered ; the object of the 
Necropborus is attained ; now its larvae have an 
asylum and a provision of victuals. 

A foreign naturalist, M. Gleditsch, has given 
some interesting details of the industry of this 



gravedigger. Going one day in pursuit of them, 
he caught four, and put them in a great glass 
globe half filled with earth and carefully closed. 
Then he put in two dead frogs. In a very little 
time one of the two frogs had been interred by 
the Necrophori. Meanwhile their companions in 
captivity wandered round the walls of the vase 
trying to escape, but finding none resigned them- 
selves to their fate and buried the other frog. 
Then he gave them the body of a linnet. A pair 
of our grave diggers at once set to work re- 
moving the ground beneath the bird's body, and 
dragging it by the feathers so as to make it go 
down quicker. The male Necrophorus ended by 
working at it alone for five hours. From time 
to time he came out of the pit, climbed upon the 
linnet, pushed it, and returned to his hole as quick 
as possible so as not to lose a minute. 

But at last even he was tired, and found that 
he must take some repose. He returned above 
ground, and, placing his head on the ground by 
the side of the body, remained motionless for an 



hour, without even moving the tips of his antennae. 
When his strength was renewed, he recommenced 
his digging operations with fresh courage. By 
next morning the linnet had sunk an inch and 
a half, and was quite surrounded by earth ; by 
evening the excavator had got it down half an 
inch more, and by the next day the bird had 
entirely disappeared. M. Gleditsch continued to 
give them small dead animals, which were buried 
one after the other. He found at last by the 
end of the fiftieth day that the four Necrophori 
had buried in the small space that they possessed, 
four frogs, three birds, two fish, a mole, and two 
grasshoppers, besides the entrails of another fish 
and two pieces of ox lung. Until further ex- 
periments of the same kind be made, it may be 
taken as a fact that one Necrophorus alone can 
in two days bury a body equal to forty times 
his own weight. 

And here was I who thought before I studied 
my breviary that work was man's privilege 



CHAPTER XIV. 

CONCLUSION. 

HOURS passed on, and I went on sleeping, happy 
in escaping the requirements of what is called the 
world. "What things had I not seen in these great 
enclosures ? Being rose upon being, and one exist- 
ence fluttered forward in another. Everywhere had 
I been witness of the presence of life, its struggles, 
and feverish activity. It could be perceived in the 
grass, on the leaves, on the surface of the earth, 
underground, in the midst of the air. Its powerful 
breath made everything fruitful, warmed the veins 
of millions of creatures, disintegrated even the stones 
themselves, and dragged them out of their inertia. 



How long could I have continued thus a sleep 
full of revelations, so absorbed in the beautiful 
picture unrolling before my eyes, respectfully 
spelling out the hieroglyphic characters of the 
great book of creation \ 

I cannot tell. A hundred years, perhaps, like 
that good monk of the Middle Ages, with mind 
enraptured among the glories of the heaven, who 
awoke with his beard white and his limbs failing 
from age. Time in reality is nothing at all, except 
as the stuff of which our existence is composed 
so short, alas, so ephemeral ! In absolute truth, 
there is no such thing as time ; the Infinite has 
no limits ; within it are unknown the landmarks 
that we so ingeniously place on our way as 
we pass to measure the surface. All that I can 
answer for is, that a very natural occurrence put 
an end to my reveries. 

At the very moment when the burying beetle 
was casting his last shovelful of earth on the 
stiffened body of the field mouse, a man took hold 
of my arm and 'shook me violently. I sprang up 




immediately in amazement, and I 

never shall I forget what was before my eyes. 

Before me stood the most curious-looking per- 
sonage imaginable. I have said it was a man, 
but any one might have made a journey from Pekin 
to Paris without find ing even among china curiosities 
such a fantastic specimen of our race. He had on 
a maroon, coat, with enormous pockets, and imple- 
ments of all kinds sticking out of them. He held 
a butterfly-net in his hand, a magnifying-glass 
hung from his neck, and his waistcoat was covered 
with long pins. A swarm of beetles ornamented 
his hat, pinned all about in the felt. 

He said to me : " Sir, I believe I am doing 
right in telling you that there is going to be 
a storm. And we have only just time to run to 
the farm." 

It was so indeed. The sky, which had been 
azure blue when I entered on the meadow, had 
gradually darkened and at last become covered by 
great heavy clouds. Some paler streaks of vapour 
of irregular shape were displayed upon this dark 




background, and slowly advanced towards the 
meadow from two opposite directions. They might 
have been compared to little ships with white sails, 
sailing in an ocean of shadows, and rushing into 
collision with one another stem to stem to fight by 
the board. Around us reigned a perfect calm. The 
air was heavy, sultry, and we had some difficulty in 
breathing. Some birds crossed the plain with shrill 
cries and disappeared among the bushes. Soon the 
leaves clashed together like so many little battledores 
moved by invisible hands. A light wind arose and 
shook the grass, increased as it got nearer the trees 
standing on the slopes, and rocked them violently. 
Some large heavy drops of rain fell around us with a 
splash- then a long roll of thunder echoing noisily 
made my companion and myself both quicken our 
steps towards the houses. As I walked I cast a 
last glance towards my meadow ; I could no longer 
see its thousand details, its tufted vegetation, and 
mysterious inhabitants, but only its broad outlines 
altered by the effect of the storm, and, as a horizon, 
the sky ploughed up by lightning. 



The new comer and I conversed as we passed 
up the valley. He was a distinguished but ori- 
ginal entomologist, who only employed himself on 
one class of Coleoptera, the Buprestidse. He had 
made a monograph of them, from the anatomical, 
organic, and historical points of view, and at his 
house possessed nearly all the varieties of them, in 
a cabinet ticketed with care, with their legs 
symmetrically extended, antennae regularly placed, 
with their names, surnames, and distinguishing 
markn, 

I spoke to him of my recent initiation into the 
inner mysteries of nature, the spectacles I had been 
witness of, the marvels of the instinct of the crea- 
tures, and their singular manners. 

" How much poetry," said I to him, "what beau- 
ties are there not beneath the tufts of wild plants we 
carelessly tread under foot ! How much is to be 
learnt from these various pictures of the life of the 
smallest of creatures ! The story of the population 
of an old Pear-Tree, simply written currents calamo, 
would itself alone furnish a great deal of interest." 



The collector looked at me, winking his eyes 

and slightly shrugging his shoulders, and said to me : 

"All this is not science. Insects are not 




subjects for mere gossip, especially the JBuprestidce. 
If a man has any pretensions to do the work well, 
he must begin by making out a catalogue of them 



and carefully detailing them in official language. 
Scientific terms must never be neglected, but rather 
freely used as tokens of depth. As for the habits 
of animals, it is more suitable to describe them 
soberly, and by preference rather in a concise and 
dry than in an amusing manner. The gate of 
the Temple of Wisdom ought to remain closed

there is interest in the thousand and one exempli-

to science the easier." 

These words made him thoughtful. We hurried 
to the farm, and when we got there concluded a 
holy alliance and pressed each other's hands with 
cordiality. 

" I was wrong," he said to me ; " there are never
