PREFACE. 



THE flattering pictures of men 
and manners, which are drawn in 
most of the present publications 
for youth, can alone be well ap- 
plied, when they are considered 
not as what mankind are, but what 
they ought to be ; and, indeed, 
we may search the world through 
before we find their likeness. 

Such is the simplicity of un- 
guarded youth, that even when 
disappointed in their expectation 
of happiness from one quarter, 



X 

they seek it in another equally 
fallacious ; and, drawing all their 
ideas from fancied " excellencies, 
fondly imagine, that; while looking 
onily for mental satisfaction,; and 
the pleasures arising from friend- 
ship, rational society, and theex-v 
cercises ,of humanity, they cannot 
Le mistaken in the pursuit; though 
too often the frequent mconsisten-r 
cies observable in those whom 
they have been led most to admire, 
excites a sigh pf sad surprise, till 
from a. more enlarged judgment, 
matured and exercised with a feel- 
ing sense of what they view, they 


XX 

learu that continual and glaring 
absurdities are all the fruit pro- 
duced in -nature's soil. 

It is to open this lesson to tfient 
that the following pages are writ- 
ten, and with the hope that if 
Folly does not blind their eyes, 
and Prejudice (who, which&^er 
way she turns, chooses to see 
things only through her own me- 
dium,) has not yet erected her 
throne in their breasts, they may 
receive even from the limited re- 
marks of a Bee and a Butterfly 
a gentle hint or two of what they 
may expect to meet with in their 



XII 

future walks through life ; and 
thus warned of the strange con- 
trarieties, perceivable in human 
pature, escape the additional pang 
their being totally unexpected 
would produce. 





CHAP. I. 

" Imagination to his view 
" Presents it, deck'd with every hue, 
" That can seduce him not to spare 
" His pow'rs of best exertion there." 

COWPER. 

A Bee who had patted the firft winter 
of his life under the foftering care of his 
mother, though often warned by her of 
miftaking a fine day early in the fpring 
for the fummer, or the time in which 
it would be of any ufe to make an ex- 
curfion from the hive,, was eager to 
begin his travels; he heard his compan- 




ions talking of the flights they had taken 
in the former fummer, and had tailed 
of the honey they had at that time 
brought home, and laid up in (lore for 
food when none other could be procured: 
he had alfo enjoyed fome of thofe flights 
"with them., and had helped to gather in 
the common ftoc^, (for Bees, though ever 
fo youngs are feldom idle;) but he was 
not aware that many a cold and wintYy 
day would yet precede the time of ga- 
thering in a frefh ftore ; even after the 
fun had fhone. and the birds had fung, 
as if it was nearly come. 

During the feverity of winter he 
remained quietly in his cell, rejoiced 
in the fhelter it afforded him, and joined 
the crowded hive in paying every re- 
fpfccl to their queen and mother, who, 
while (he treated them with the care 
and tendernefs of a parent, kept up her 




dignity as a foyereign, and ruled her 
fubjefts with the greateft order. Every* 
part of her dominions was thoroughly 
known to her, and nothing fuffered to 
remain within them that could annoy 
her numerous family; fhe rejoiced in 
their prosperity, and all were happy 
'under her government except the little 
fellow who is to be the hero of my tale. 
He would often creep to the entrance 
of the hive and peep, firft on one fide 
and then on the other, of the covering 
placed before it by its careful owners, 
while the bluftering winds were 
raging around; but no fooner did the 
leaft warm weather appear than it was 
removed for the inhabitants to have 
more air, and this, to our young one, 
was a joyful fight; he looked upon it 
as a prelude to the fummer, and run- 
ning to his companions, he faid, " we 


fhall foon be able to get out, the way is 
open/' 

" Be not too eager;" replied one of 
more experience than himfelf, te by 
the time one winter has pafifed over your 
head you may be a little wifer." 

" It is paffed, I think," returned the 
young one, v don't you feel the warmth 
of the fun? It reminds me of the plea- 
fant rambles we took together laft 
fuHnmer, and I am impatient to renew 
them." 

" Yon are indeed impatient" replied 
the hoar} Bee/' but time enough yet ; 
don't you know that our cities are 
always placed in fuch advantageous 
fituations that we have the earl left benefit 
from the fun's rays ? but let not this make 
you fuppofe the feafon farther advanc- 
ed than it is." 

" Well, now," replied the conceited 




chatterer, (< only put your head out and 
feel how very warm it is." 

" No, * I thank you/' returned the 
other, with a fhrug; " I know what it 
is to trufl to appearances, and can feel 
even here that the cold weather is not 
gone, and if you go only to the back of 
the hive you may hear how the wind ftill 
whittles behind it." 

" I had rather look at the funfhine/' 
returned the fimple one, and leaving his 
fage advifer he determined to think that 
it was becaufe he was old and lazy he 
wifhed to ftay at home, and keep others 
there alfo, as an excufe for his own idle- 
nefs; " let them ftay then," faid he, 
" but for my part I am inclined to make 
the moft of my time., and no doubt fhall 
bring home many a load before thefe 
old creepers will believe that there is 
any thing to be gathered." 



This refolution of the young Bee was 
not long a fecret in the community; he 
fcuzzed it about among all his acquain- 
tances ; nor was it hid from the queen, 
\vho, acting in the two-fold character, 
firft warned him of the danger, and 
then, on pain of their not being re-ad- 
rained, abfolutely forbade any one's 
Agoing out of the hive without her leave. 
But what can deter the obftinacy of a 
conceited youngfter? Nothing. If ex- 
perience obliges him to confefs that 
in one thing he is wrong, he ftill conti- 
nues as firmly bent upon another ; and 
if 'once inclined to think that he muft 
know as well as others, will continue to 
think fo, till experience teaches him that 
in all things he is liable to miftake. 
But my little hero was not yet brought 
to this conclufion, neither perhaps are 
many who will read his hiftory; but, as 
our ingenious fabwlilt tells us, 





" Every object of creation 

" Can furnish hints for contemplation," 

who knowsvvhether fomething may not 
be learnt from the hifiory of a Bee? 

In fpite of the remonftrances of 
her majefty, he ftill wifhed to get out, 
and after daily vifiting the front of the 
hive for nearly a month, during which 
time the fine weather continued, he be- 
gan to perfuade himfelf the interdiction 
could not extend fo far as this; <f It has 
been fine a great while," laid he to him- 
felf, " and if we flay within at this rate 
we fhali let all the fummer pafs away ;" 
and again his former furmife returned, 
" they are old and lazy," continued he, 
" and while they have any food left, are 
determined not to feek for more ; I will 
not ftay, however;" and he was ftill farj 
ther confirmed in this refolution, when 
boldly advancing quite out on the block 





hefaw other Bees, from a neighbouring 
hive, taking the air, and appearing like 
himfelf to be thinking it high time to 
get abroad. A fwarm of infecls -alfo 
were enjoying themfelves, and frifking 
about in the warm fun. Struck with 
fhame that thefe fhould be on the wing 
before him, he at that moment forgot 
all the kind admonitions of his mother, 
and the punifhment that awaited him 
if he difobeyed them ; and mounting in 
the^ air, his loud humming tellified his 
joy at being again at liberty. But alas ! 
where was he to go ? or to what flower 
could he now pay his court ? The flut- 
tering infecls he had feen were but the 
dancers of the day, juft born to frifk a 
few hours, and then return to their ori- 
ginal nothingnefs; and our young ad- 
venturer difdained to join the giddy 
train., or even to appear to notice what 





was fo unlike the character of a bufy 
Bee. 

It was now the latter end of April, 
when the thorn is in blofibm, violets 
and primrofes aifo decorate the hedges, 
and the hypatica, and polyanthus " of 
unnumbered dyes/' already appeared in 
the gardens ; but very few leaves were 
yet on the trees, though the buds were 
burfiing, and many of the fruit-trees 
were in full bloom ; to thefe our little 
wanderer winged his way, and as he flew 
from bloffom to bloflbm, and from one 
branch to the other, he could not but 
acknowledge with regret that his limbs 
felt cold, and very different from the 
vigour they poffeffed the former fum- 
mer. He wifhed to attribute it to his 
having been kept fo long within the 
hive, but a fudden blaft foon checked 
his ardour ; a fhivering came over him, 




and a drowfinefs, which he could not 
account for, fucceeded;prefently a pelt- 
ing fhower obliged him to creep for 
fhelter into a wall, againft which the 
trees were nailed, and here he began to 
fee his error; " Can I go back again?" 
faid he ;" Ah ! no, they will not receive - 
me; my ablence is by this time known, 
and I am never to be admitted more. 
Oh, my mother ! would that I had fol- 
lowed your counfel!" 

He had fcarcely fpoken thefe words, 
when a mid fpread itfelf before his 
eyes; his breath appeared failing, and 
he found himfelf itill more inclined to 
fleep, yet inftincl: told him that in 
fuch a (tate to give way to the inclina- 
tion was dangerous ; he feared the cold 
would feize him while iufenfible, and 
his life muft pay for it, but all his 
efforts to keep himfelf awake were 





vain ; the rain continued fo, that he 
could not get out to ufe his wings, and at 
length loft to all recolleclion, he funk 
ftupid and fenfelefs to the bottom of 
his retreat. 

How long he continued in this torpid 
ftate I cannot fay, but his friends he had 
left, after anxioufly expecling his return 
from day to day, and being difappoint- 
ed a gave him up for loft; and though he 
often awoke during his confinement, it 
was only to a keener fenfe of his mifery ; 
his limbs were ftill too ftiff to move, his 
eyes dim, and each time that he clofed 
them to return to fleep, (now the only 
alleviation of hisforrows, ) he concluded 
he fhpuld never open them again : he 
breathed a figh of regret on the remem- 
brance of the home he had quitted, and 
would gladly have returned, and in the 
prefence of the whole community ac- 





knowledge his rafhnefs ; but alas ! he 
could not now move a wing : yet as the 
warm weather came on, he felt himfelf 
revive beyond his hopes : he could look 
out from the place of his confinement, 
and though not fo ardent in his expecta- 
tions as a few weeks before, hebegan again 
to feel a pleafure in the rays of the fun, 
and to anticipate a future enjoyment of 
them. <c I mall not die/' faid he to 
himfelf, " but (hall yet be able to ac- 
complifh my defire, and fhew myfelf an 
induftrious Bee/' 

The trees on which he had before 
obferved only blofTom were now full 
of leaves; where the bloom had firft 
appeared, he faw the fruit, yet in its 
infant ftate. f< This is not now the food 
for me," faid he, and he looked wifh ful- 
ly around to obferve if there were 
any flowers near, from which he could 





gather his accuflomed nourifhment. 
While thus engaged, a Butterfly, on fpor- 
tive wing, came frifking by, and though 
he let tied fir ft on one leaf, and then on an- 
other, was unmindful of him,, till he fixed 
direclly on that which (haded the place 
from which our poor invalid was examin- 
ing the neighbouring plants. (C Oh !" 
faid he, with a heavy figh, as he marked 
the light wing of this new comer, " Oh ! 
that I could fly like him and ramble from 
flower to flower, without pain or dread 
of any." 

The attention of the Butterfly was 
attra&ed by the mournful tone in 
which this was uttered, and unlike many 
of his kind, he even flopped to liften to 
the complaining infecl, and afk if he 
could relieve him; " Perhaps," faid he, 
t( you are entangled in a fpider's web; 




and though lam unufed to the art of war, 
I will endeavour to liberate you." 

<f An offer like this/' replied the 
Bee, " I fhould not have expected 
from one of your nature ; but you 
can give me no afiiftance; it is not a 
web which keeps me here/ but ill 
health, and which I have brought upon 
myfelf by my own folly: I have no 
one elfe to blame, that I am not flying 
about as you are, though I hope 
to fome better purpofe." 

<e Do not be too fure.of that," re- 
plied the good-humoured Butterfly, 
c: nor defpife the help of one fo' infignl- 
ficant as you fuppofe I am; if I can 
in any way a. (lift you, I (hall not have 
been flying about in vain." 

" I beg your pardon," returned the 
Bee, confcious that he fhould not 



have anfwered in fuch a manner ; 
" pray let the pain I feel plead my 
excufe; I have been confined within 
Ibis place for I don't know how long, 
and now I feel the enlivening beams of 
the fun without being able to enjoy 
them, and mud even fiarve for want 
cf food, after I have efcaped death from 
the cold fhat fir(t feized me." 

"Do not bedifcouraged," replied the 
Butterfly,, " look at the border jutt below 
yon, where there are many of the 
mo*! beautiful flowers J fu rely they will 
afford you nourimment ; you need not 
fear fiarving in the midit of plenty." 

" I can't extend nay wings," faid the 
Bee, very mournfully. 

"If not your wings,," replied his 
cheerful comforter, (C can't you ufe 
your feet and crawl down the wall, 
and then upon the ground, till you 



reach the flowers ; don't be afraid, I'll 
venture my life that you will be able 
to fly after taking a little of the delici- 
ous food they offer you." . 

Animated by the Butterfly's words, the 
poor half-ftarved Bee endeavoured to 
follow his advice, and flowly creeping 
forth, he reached at length the defira- 
ble haven of a beautiful convolvulus, 
whofe head refted on the ground, whilft 
his compaffionate advifer waited on 
the neareft bud to obferve his pro- 
grefs; " did not I fay you could reach 
it?'' faid he, fluttering his wings for 
joy, ef who (hall defpife the counfel 
of a Butterfly ?" 

"I will not for the future/' replied the 
Bee, as he felt himfelf reviving from the 
fweet fmell of the flowers, and the warm 
rays of the fun fhining full upon his 
back, and a^ain he entreated him to 




pardon the churlifhnefs with which he 

at firft received it. 

te Oh, fay no more of that," return. 
cd the Butterfly, " but tell me if you 
do not find yourfelf better already ? 
whaf, becaufe you could hot fly, were 
youtofiarve? Thottghitmaybeadifgrace 
for one who has wings to crawl, yet fure- 
ly it is better to do this than lie down 
and die; but I do not defpair of feeing 
you fly to-morrow;" and, as he faid this, 
extended his wings, as if to depart. 

" You will not leave me," faid the 
Bee, who the longer he nefiled in the 
bell of the flower and tafted the food it 
afforded, felt his affeclion increafe for 
the means through which he hadprocured 
it; " Won't you flay and fee me return 
to my habitation ? I think you'll already 
obferve an alteration for the better." 

The Butterfly received this invitation 


with pleafure ; indeed he had only pre- 
tended tobe going that he might obferve 
% if he was ftill of fo little confequence in 
the eyes of the Bee, as for him not to 
wifh his ftay. He therefore readily ac- 
cepted it, attended him home,, and had 
the pleafure of feeing him much better 
able to get up the wall than down it : and 
from this time a lading friendfliip com- 
menced between them, no lefs (ingular in 
its kind than in the caufeofif; for natu- 
rally thefe infects do notnotice the other. 
The Butterfly, after feeing his new 
friend fafely landed at his old refting- 
place, and with him a little (tore of the 
delicate food he had been rafting, mark- 
ed the place, and kindly promifed 
to fee him again the next morning, 
<f when," faid he, " I hope I (hall find 
you both able and willing to take a 
(hort flight with me," and then left him. 




CHAP. II. 

" Excuse me then if pride, conceit, 
" The manners of the fair, and great, 

* I give to monkeys, asses, dogs, 

** Fleas, owls, goats, butterflies, and hogs ; 

* 1 say that these are proud; what then f 
". I never said they equal men." 

GAY, 

THE Bee thus returned began to feel 
fonocthing like pleafure, and as the 
morning fun lighted the place in which 
be had been fo long a prifoner, his hopes 
revived that he fhould yet feel a greater 
"benefit from them. 

He had not room to move his wings 
freely, yet he thought them rather more 
pliable, and creeping upon the branch 
of the tree which /haded the entrance of 
Ms habitation, he endeavoured^ to 
cleanie them from the dirt and ftiflf- 
nefs which had incumbered thenr, 




and after repeatedly ftroking his 
back with the little brufhes with which 
Nature had fnpplied his feet, he fuc- 
ceeded, and was able to fly from his fta- 
tion to a neighbouring flower. 

He had not forgotten the Butterfly, 
but he did not fuppofe that he would 
remember him or his engagement of the 
preceding evening, but again he had to 
acknowledge the miftake of prejudice, 
for he had not been long upon the 
flower, ( made more fweet by his having 
found the ufe of his wings to obtain it,) 
before he faw his friend approaching, 
flying through the air* and never fixing 
till he had found 'the fpot on which he 
had left him. 

The loud humming of the Bee foon 
difcovered that he was not far ofl 
and the Butterfly haftening towards 
him, congratulated him on having found 



his liberty. tf You are taking your 
breakfafl/' faid he, " I give you joy of 
a fine morning/' and after the kindeft 
enquiries of how he now found himfelf, 
he exprefled his hope that he would be 
able to accompany him to a field of 
cowflips which he had patted at a little 
diftance ; " they fmell fo fweet, and look 
fo beautiful," continued he, " hanging 
down their yellow heads^ that though I 
certainly admire a greater variety of co- 
lours, I could not but be pleafed with 
thefe, and had I not wifiied for your 
company, could have flown from one to 
the other for fome time; I am fure one 
day's feafting on their fweets willreftore 
you to perfect health; come, ftiall I lead 
the way ?" 

" I cannot but be grateful for your 
folicitude," returned the Bee, <e and 
that you fliould fo f ar forget your na- 





ture as to be anxious for me who am 
of fo different an one; I am able t" fly- 
but very (lowly, if at all, and you will 
like to extend your rambles much far- 
ther than lean accompany you ; do not, 
therefore, think of tying y ourfelf to me/* 
The Butterfly was evidently (^appoint- 
ed ; " I know," faid he, f( that our na- 
tures are different; I am not held in fuch 
high eftimation asyourfelf, nor am I half 
fo ufeful, or my life fo long as yourY; 
' the creatures but of a day/ is what we 
are generally called, yet that day it is 
my wifli to fpend well, and as far as is 
in my power to be of benefit to another ; 
if it was to one meaner than myfelf it 
would be gratifying, but when I confi- 
der that it is to a Bee that my fervices 
are ufeful, it is doubly fo ; why then will 
you deny me this pleafure ?" 

The Bee could not but be ftruck 





with this fingular proof of friendfhip 
in one from whom he had not de- 
ferved it, and though he might be 
unwilling that any of his old compa- 
nions fhould fee him afibciating with 
one whom they were moftly inclined to 
treat with contempt, he could no longer 
refift his importunity, and therefore, 
promifed to accompany him to the place 
he had mentioned, and where he was 
amply recompenced by the delicious 
food he found there, for the fatiguing 
though fliort flight he had taken to pro- 
cure it, whilft the good-natured Butter- 
fly was equally gratified by feeing his 
friend enjoy the fragrance he had intro- 
duced him to. " You will flay here 
all day," faid he, <f and by night I ex- 
peel to fee you ftrong and hearty; if 
you pleafe, I will fly about a little, and 
perhaps (hall b able to bring you intel- 




Hgence of food for to-morrow, but pro- 
raife me to remain here till my return." 

f< Undoubtedly/' replied the Bee, 
half loft in one of the fweet recedes 
he was thus enjoying, " believe 
me I feel your kindnefs ! If you had 
notvifited me laft nigftt, and encouraged! 
my feeble efforts to move, I fhould have 
laid (till and died, and all thefe bounties 
of Nature would have been fpread in 
vain for me; indeed, I am obliged to 
you, and feel that though you may never 
be of fuch fervice to me again, I fhould 
be forry to lofe your acquaintance." 

This acknowledgement was fufficient 
for the Butterfly, who fluttered about in 
grateful joy, and in the courfe of the 
day made many excurfions, from all of 
which he returned with goodhumourand 
kind enquiries; while the Bee continued 
to fly from flower to flower, and though 





he was fometimes ready to regret that he 
had not a hive, to which he could carry 
the produce of his labours, and receive 
the commendations of his mother for fo 
doing, he felt that he was yet too weak 
to work to much advantage, and there- 
fore tried to be content with what was 
neceffary for himfelf. 

Several Bees came to this field of 
fweets, in which he was thus re veiling; 
but none of his old acquaintance were 
among them, and he forbore to fpeak to 
them; " though idle myfelf," faid he ; (f I 
will not make others fo by engaging" 
them in talk with me ;" and indeed fo 
anxious was he not to difgrace the cha- 
racter of what a Beejhouldbe, that if h 
thought any of them were noticing him, 
he would pretend to be ear"-.. at 
work alfo, led they mould 6 
an idle drone. 



In his next vifit, the Butterfly brought 
him fuch intelligence as he thought 
would be agreeable to him; tc We are 
in the -land of plenty," faid he, fi every 
thing is flourifhing, and innumerable 
flowers are every where to be feen." 

'-' I (hall foon be able to vifit them/' 
returned the Bee, (f and after one more 
night's reft I fhall almoft forget that J 
have been ill; I have already recovered 
my fpirits, and my health will foon re- 
turn." 

As they were thus talking, they ob- 
ferved a troop of children with bafkets 
in their hands, and an old man at their 
head, who feemed to be directing their 
fteps to the field they were in. 

" Thefe are fome of my tormentors," 
faid the butterfly, " though they appear 
to admire me, and to wifh me no harm, 
they are in reality my greateft enemies; 


even the found of their voices puts me 
in a fright: Oh ! how fick I am of 
hearing them finging, " Butterfly, but- 
terfly, come to me/' though you may 
be very fure I never accept their 
invitation; once I was (hut up in a box 
for nearly a whole day by one of 
thefe kind admirers, with a few green 
leaves for me to eat and fleep upon ; 
and I fuppofe (he thought fhe was doing 
me a very great favor to procure me fuch 
a refidence; but I was much more 
obliged to another little girl, who in her 
abfence let me out of my confinement, 
and fince that time I have been more 
than ever anxious to efcape their notice." 
<c I know nothing of an alarm of that 
fort," replied the Bee, " children are 
in general afraid of me, and I have Ibme- 
times been half inclined to regret it, 
though in reality I believe it is the beft 




thing that could happen, but thefe," 
continued he, " if I am not miitaken, 
are going to be otherwise employed 
than in admiring either you or me, for 
I think we fhail fee I hem gathering the 
flowers on which we have been feeding, 
and this was actually ihe cafe, for as they 
entered the h< ( 1, t',e old man encou- 
raged them in by prom ifing that 
when the v;in $ s made for which thefe 
cowflipswere . ., "leied, tj)eyfhould 
all have a glais of it 

" What devouring creatures are thefe 
men," obferved the Bee, ** every one 
of thefe fweet flowers will be deftroyed 
to make their wine ; but they are f the 
Lords of the Creation,' and take away 
at one liroke what would fatisfy us more 
moderate creatures for months and 
months ; but fee, the children are conning, 
had you not better take to your wings?'' 




" Not yet," replied the Butterfly, "they 
are going to be otherwife engaged ; 
Vs w^en they are idle, or at play, that I 
have molt reafon to be alarmed, and be- 
fides here are a great many more of my 
race frifking about, though among ever fo 
great a number, I am the moil admired." 

The Bee f mi led at thisdifcovery vf vani- 
ty in his friend, though he made no reply, 
and as the children began clearing the 
field at the other end of it, they conti- 
nued a little longer to enjoy the fweets 
they were fo foon to be deprived o till 
the (hades of the evening began to ad- 
vance, when the Bee propofed returning 
home, and bade a : ieu ! thofe charming 
flowers from which he had gathered 
health and ftrength, and a fufficient (tock 
of honey to take home with him. 

" Where do you repofe for the night ?" 
laid he to his friend, " have you no 


fettled place of abode, or do you reft 
upon the firii flower you meet with ?" 

" I generally pafs the night under a 
green leaf, or in the cup of a flower/' 
replied the Butterfly, " and nlay this eve- 
ning find a place to repofe in near your 
habitation, if you have no objection/* 

" I fhould be glad of your company 
within it," returned the Bee, '* were it 
large enough to admit us both, but what 
do you live upon ? cannot you tafte 
fome of the provifion I am going to 
carry home ? you fhallbe very welcome." 

The Butterfly teftified his thanks by 
a fluttering of his wings; " but I do not 
particularly relifh that food," faid he, 
" and you would perhaps wonder what 
it is we do eat, for it is no uncommon 
opinion that we live upon air; how- 
ever, in our reptile (late, we make up 
for our little eating now; were you to 





fee the deviation we make in the vege- 
table world, you would be furprifed; 
three or four dozen of us will deftroy a 
bed of cabbages in an hour or two, 
and we often ftrip a Ihrub of all its 
leaves in the courfe of a morning." 

" And do you boaft of this?" 
replied the Bee; " furely it is exulting 
in mifchief." 

; ' It is our native? returned the 
thoughtlefs Butterfly; t( and. what is 
the mifchief, as you call it, compared to 
that which men are daily doing? do 
they not deftroy us by thoufands, 
whenever they have an opportunity ? 
and why fhould^ow, of all others, plead 
for them, who, when you have fpent 
your lives in their fervice, and procured 
for them that food which they can ob- 
tain from no other quarter, burn and 
deftroy your hives and yourielves too ? 





Oh! I have patted one of ttiefe monu- 
ments of their ungrateful cruelty, and 
feen the mangled remains of your fel- 
low-creatures till my wings have quite 
trembled again, and yet you never do 
them harm; they form your habitation, 
and encourage^ r cu to build in them by 
pretending to fhelter you from all evil, 
yetafter all this fancied kindnefs, if they 
think you are too old to labour for them 
any longer, as a reward for all you have 
done, they fet fire to your houfes, and 
deftroy thoufands of you in the flames ! 
talk no more of mifchief in eating a few 
cabbages, or devouring the leaves of a 
tree." 

" Thefe are fhocking truths," re'- 
plied the Bee, " my blood runs cold 
to think of it, and yet fuch is my nature 
t!\at, though I know I am fafe from fuch 
de vaftations where I now am, I would 





rather add my labours to the common 
Hock of my native hive, could I but 
find the way to return to it, and fhare 
the fate of my fellow-labourers, if fuch 
a fate awaits them; but who knows that 
we may not efcape? it is not every Bee 
that is thus deftroyed." 

" Nature," returned his friend, " has 
armed you with a defenfive weapon 
with which I think you might foon re- 
pel your deftroyers: but as for us pocr 
Butterflies, we can do nothing to defend 
ourfelves." 

"Tis true," returned the Bee, <f we have 
this weapon, and we have often made 
our enemies fly by ufingit; but you 
muft know, fuch is their cunning cow- 
ardice, that they will not attack us on 
equal terms; they muft have the covert 
of the night for their cruel work, and 
when we are all in our hives, each enclof- 





ed in their waxen cell, they begin the 
horrid maflacre; I fhould feel it more, 
but that I believe they take as great de- 
light in deftroying each other as they do 
in killing us ; for I have heard them re- 
joicing together that fo many of the 
enemy were flain, and I know they mean 
their fellow men by tins appellation, 
for they don't dignify us with that title; 
their great enmity to infecls arifes from 
\vhat they deftroy ; and yet, in one day., 
they themfelves devour more than any 
. of them, but then they think every thing 
that can be ufeful to them was only 
made for that purpofe, and no one can 
fay they do not take care to make it ful- 
fill that end, whatever elfe is left un- 
done." 

" But the queftion is, whether they 
have any right to deltroy you, after that 
is done?" rejoined the Butterfly, 



Cf A queftion too hard for me to an- 
fwer/'returrtedthe Bee; "but this! know, 
that we have a right to defend ourfelves 
again (t them whenever we can ; and I 
know alfo, that for the kindnefs you 
have mown me I'll defend you from 
their attacks as long as I am able : but 
we are arrived at my dwelling, let us 
reft upon this tree while the fun is 
taking its laft peep at the horizon." 

After refrefhing themfelves with a . 
little of the honey the Bee had brought 
home, and of which the Butterfly juft 
tailed a little, becaufe he would not ap- 
pear to refufe what was kindly meant, 
they parted for thenight.theBee refolv- 
ing to travel farther the next day, and, 
if pofllble, to find out his old habitation, 
though not without afTuring the Butter- 
fly that if he mould be fo happy as to be 
re-admitted, it mould make no diffe- 
rence in his friendihip for him.

w And thus a never-ceasing pleasure flow*, 
" Or to the human, or the bestial race, 
" From those ideal charms wealiattach to place." 
LOCAL ATTACHMENT. 

TITR next morning oar two friends 
awoke with the fun, and before half my 
readers are out of their beds, their pere- 
grinations commenced, one in queft of 
whatever he could turn into fomething 
ufeful, the other to 6.nd what was new 
and entertaining. When they met, the 
Bee was (till defirous of finding his old 
habitation. ff But why ?" faid the Butter- 
fly, " furely the little cell you now live 
in will do very well for the fummer; 
you are in no danger where you are, 
and have the delightful privilege of 
calling it all your own." 

" All this is true," replied the Bee, 




" but what a life am I now leading? 
adding nothing to the general (tock ; 
while all my brethren are bufily em- 
ployed in gathering what will be of 
equal benefit to each, no, no . there is 
a pleafure in being thus mutually 
afiiflant to others which only thoie 
who have experienced it can know ; 
and I am refolved, if poffible, to enjoy it 
again." 

The Butterfly looked furprifed, for 
though capable of that attachment 
which proceeds from finding an agreeable 
companion ; and with (bme idea of the. 
fervices beftowed upon thofe we Iove 5 
and which endears the name of friend, 
he could not imagine that any pleafure 
could arife from fpending his time in 
labour ; but as long as his friend had 
aflured him of the continuance of his 
regard, he was defirous that he mould 






obtain what he wifhed, and willingly 
offered to affift him in the fearch. 

During their airy rounds they often 
flopped to refrefh themfelves on fome 
favorite flower, and though feldom fixing 
on the fame, and to a cafual obferver did 
not appear to be at all connected, they 
were never out of fight of each other. 
It was from one of thefe refting places, 
in which the Bee was delightfully em- 
ployed extracting fweets from an " ex- 
tended field of blofTomed beans," that 
the Butterfly flretched his wings to a 
neighbouring garden ; here fuch vari- 
ous beauties met his eyes that he could 
not help returning to call his friend to 
enjoy them with him. " Such a bed 
of tulips, I have met with," faid he, 
" whofe fplendid colours can only be 
equalled by my wings ; pray come, and 
fee what lovely flowers/' 



(( Have you not yet learnt that 
there is fomething more valuable in a 
flower than its colour?" returned the 
Bee,, with a f mile ; " for my part I 
would prefer thefe honeyed beans, 
though I fuppofe you would think 
them hardly worth looking at, but of 
all other flowers tulips have the lead 
fweetnefs about them, and are fit only 
to pleale the eye of thoie men and but- 
terflies who judge only by appearance; 
but though I have feen the formeradmir- 
ingabed of tulips, Ihave often obferved 
that if they wifti to ornament themfelves, 
or their houfes, the flowers which we 
chiefly prefer are alfo the objecls of 
their choice ! as for thefe beans, though 
I believe they admire their fmell, men 
are, as I faid before, fuch deftruclive 
creatures, that while they are enjoying 
what is fweet they are at the fame time 




deftroying it; and as they expecl fome- 
thing {till more valuable from thefe 
flowers, they are content to let them re- 
main upon their ftalks; but we can have 
our fill of their fweets, and yet not injure 
what they will hereafter produce. Oh ! 
had I but a hive to go to/' continued he, 
as he ftretched his wings to accompany 
his friend, " how many times mould I 
have gone thither yefterday, and to-day 
from the cowflips and the beans, and 
what repeated loads mould I have car- 
ried home." 

" Surely, furely," thought the idle 
Butterfly, " you need not regret that ; 
to fly hither and thither as you like, 
with no incumbrance of any kind, and, 
nocare beyond to-morrow, is far better; 1 ' 
fo thought the Butterfly, and fo perhaps 
think many Butterflies of the human 
race; but he forbore to repeat his 





fentiments on this fubjeft, for, uncon- 
fcious to himfelf, he was awed by the 
fnperiority of his friend/ while he 
felt no wifh to be of tlie fame opinion. 
f: And fo tlaefe 3re the flower* von 
admire/' continues the Bee. as tiiey 
alighted, " and which can only be 
equalled in Beauty bv nonr wings? 
Ah, my dear friend, would not vour wings 
be juft asufefr' :; tu -y itfeffC or cover- 
ed with red and purple? look at the 
plain white ones of nuir' our 

race., who are now flying around us; you 
cannot extend your flight farther than 
fhefe; but fee, fome children are enter- 
ing the garden, I queicioa if you will 
not foon jiave a greater cauie to regret 
the beauty of your wings than to admire 
it, and that you will be the objeci of 
their purfuit as foon as you meet their 



eyes, while your plainer brethren will 
pafs unregarded." 

This prediction was foori verified, for 
no fooner did the littles ones perceive 
this felf-admiring Butterfly than they 
all exclaimed, " Oh ! what a beauty ! 
let us catch it." 

cs If you get on that fide of the bed, 
and / on this," faid a boy, who appeared 
lo be the eldeft of the party, " I will 
throw my hat at it, and we (hall foon 
have it in our pofTeffion." 

" Not for the world, mafter Henry," 
faid the maid, who accompanied them; 
" you would deftroy thofe beautiful 
flowers at once if you did, and your 
papa would be fo angry." 

" The flowers then are more admired 
than you are my friend," obferved the 
Bee, et for you fee the maid will not 
let the m be injured, not even to procure 





a fight of your dill more beautiful 
wings." 

" Don't laugh at me," replied the 
Butterfly, fomewhat mortified; " I am 
glad, however, that I have found a 
place of fafety; if I take care not to 
quit this ftation, they will not be able 
to get at me." 

Altho' it was his intention to remain 
there, his young purfuers would not 
let him be at reft, but with one thing 
and another lo contrived to fhake the 
flowers upon which he fettled, that, at 
laft, wearied out with thefe repeated 
removals, he took to his wings, and 
flew to a neighbouring rofe-tree. 

" Now, now," cried all the children, 
we fhall have it ; don't let it get upon 
the tulips again, and we fhall certainly 
catch it." 

The Bee lay all this time in the 




bell of a hyacinth, not unmindful of his 
friend, or his purfuers, but thinking his 
prefent alarm might be an ufeful evi- 
dence of what he had been faying, and 
a check to his vanity, he refolved to let 
him feel a little more of the dangerous 

o 

effe6t his much-admired beautv was 
likely to produce ; but after the young 
folk had given him one or two hafty 
flights round die garden, he came for- 
ward, and appearing in front of all the 
young ones, foon checked the eagernefs 
of their chace. 

" A Bee, a bee," exclaimed they, 
" take care, or it will fting you," while 
the poor trembling Butterfly began 
to take frefh courage on feeing his 
friend approach ; and, feating himfelf 
oa the branch of an honey-fuckle, 
endeavoured to regain his breath. 

The oldeft boy was now refolved to 





make one more etlbrt, and creeping 
fiowly to the place, put forth his hand 
to reach the prize, when the Bee. 
perceiving his intention, again darted 
before his eyes, and made him retreat. 
" Thank you, thank you, my dear 
friend/' Paid the poor Butterfly, ff fure- 
ly they will not attempt to purfue me 
any more; you muft have fufficiently 
frightened them." 

" I'll do fomething more than fright- 
en them if they do," replied the Bee; 
" they (hall feel what it is to enrage 
one of us ;" nor would thefe children, 
animated by the prefence of each 
other, give up their chace, till the 
Bee had abfolutely fulfilled his threat, 
by juft touching the hand of one of 
them with his (harp fting: and Oh! 
what a clamour was infiantly raifed by 
the whole party for this cruel a6l, as it 



was called ; the child cried, and the 
maid declared it was a lhame of the naf- 
ty Bee to fling one who never thought 
of hurting Mm :" while all the others 
gathered round their wounded brother 
to exprefs their pity and abhorrence 
of the deed; and while they retired from 
the garden to get fomething to alle- 
viate the frnart, our two friends were 
left to recover themfelves and congra- 
tulate each other on theirfafety. I ne- 
ver was fo near being taken in my life, 
and efcaped at laft," faid the Butterfly; 
cc but to you, my friend, I am indebted 
for my prefent liberty ; if you had not 
exerted yourfelf in my behalf I muft 
have been in their poffefiion; I tremble 
at the thought of it, and am complete- 
ly tired out in the chace they have 
given me." 

" Now, then, I hope you will acknow- 




ledge that your beauty is no real ad- 
vantage to you/' replied the Bee, 
" but till you are recovered I will vifit 
yonder beautiful acafia which feems 
to court my notice; befides, I am not 
without a hope that from it I fhall fee 
my ardently defired home ; I feem to 
remember its being near it." 

Our airy traveller fpoke this with 
peculiar animation, but on reaching 
the tree, his pleafure was ftill higher, 
for, from thence, he beheld the fpot 
he was in purfuit of; although many 
hives were near it, he could diftin- 
guifh his own from all the reft by 
a thoufand little marks known only to 
thofe who inhabit it. His heart beat 
with tranfport; it appeared to him 
the abode of peace and plenty, and 
it was within his reach alfo; the 
flowers on which he had refted was 




entirely di (regarded, and he flood 
gazing on the well known fpor, " flung 
with the thoughts of home." 

The endearments of his mother 
returned to his mind with double 
force, nor could he fear being well 
received by her, and if by her, all the 
reft he knew dared not ufe him diffe- 
rently; " I will acknowledge my difobe- 
dience to her commands/' faid he, 
ff and when fhe knows what I have 
gone through fhe will forgive me ; I 
fhall again receive her commenda- 
tions, and repofe my felf under her mild 
and equitable government/' 

With thefe thoughts he could fcarcely 
forbear flying away, and rufhing at 
once into the prefence of his friends; 
but lie recollected the poor Butterfly, 
and though there was nothing in 
their natures which could aflimilate. 





he ftill remembered that in a great 
meafure he owed his prefent health 
and ftrength to him; " when firft we 
met/ 1 continued he, " there was no- 
thing in me to induce his affection; 
I was poor, fick, and helplefs, and yet 
he was interefted for me, and (hall I 
leave him now ? no, I will return and 
tell him what I have feen, and that 
though for the future I mall refide 
with more fuitable afibciates, we may 
ftill often meet." 

Thus determined, he haftened back, 
with all the livelinefs of joy, to in- 
form his friend, who obferved his 
coming, and the cheerful air with 
which he approached; " I have feen 
my hive/' cried the Bee, without giv- 
ing him time to make the enquiry, 
" I have feen it ! come, won't you go 
with me, and at lead fee the place to 




which I am going to return, and though 
I cannot afk you to enter with me, (none 
but bees being permitted to come in 
there) I fhall never fee you when I am 
out of it without pleafure." 

ec My dear friend/' replied the 
Butterfly, <e after the kindnefs you have 
(hewn me this morning, it would be 
ungrateful not to rejoice in what 
gives you pleafure; I think I am now 
able to ufe my wings again, and will 
readily accompany you ; and though I 
know I muft ftand at an humble dif- 
tance while you enter, yet I (hall be 
anxious to hear how you are receiv- 
ed, and whether your old companions 
will forgive your leaving them." 

" I have but the difpleafure of one to 
fear/' replied the Bee, " and if fhe 
forgives me, the reft have nothing to do 
\vith it, nor have I much to apprehend 



from that quarter, fince the authority 
of a fovereign is tempered by the affec- 
tion of a parent." 

Thus converting they purfued their 
flight till arriving at a ihort diftance 
from the well-known hive, " Don't 
you fee it?" faid the Bee, fluttering 
his wings for joy; " don't you be- 
hold the welcome fpot?" 

" I fee a number of hives," return- 
ed the Butterfly, not quite ib enrap- 
tured as his friend, " but which is 
yours I cannot tell." 

" Mark the one into which I fly," faid 
the Bee, ff and then you'll know it." 

" But when fhall I fee you again ?" 
enquired the Butterfly in a melancholy 
tone, on feeing his friend preparing for 
flight; " to-day?" 

<e Perhaps not," replied the other; 
fe I may not be permitted to come 




out again, or I may be indulged with 
a day's reft, and converfation with ray 
mother, but do not fuflfer yourfelf to 
doubt my friendfhip for you, becaufe 
I do not fly out every hour and re- 
peat my profeffions of it ; to-morrow, 
at fartheit, I fhall renew my labours for 
the general good, and then if you like 
to accompany me in my flights, I mall 
be glad of your company." 

With thefe words he firetched his 
wings, while the Butterfly bade him 
farewell, and watching his approach 
and entrance to the hive, refolved to 
hover round the place in hopes of 
learning what reception he had met 
with. 

As the returning vagrant advanced 
towards the centre of all his hopes and 
fears, he felt the latter fenfibly encreafe, 
yet he could not but advance ; at firft 




he fettled on the block upon which the 
hive was placed, every part of which 
was perfect in his recollection > he ob- 
ferved no one near, for as it was now 
the middle of the day, almoft all were 
out, bufily employed, except a few, 
whom he knew were always on the 
watch to keep out every intruder; at 
length he ventured within the hive, and 
immediately all the humming inmates 
which were then at home flocked around 
him; fome concluded that he had mifla- 
ken his hive, while others imagined 
they could recollect his form and figure. 
" Do you not know me?" faid he, " I 
once belonged to your fraternity, and 
my heart is ftill knit towards you/' 

On hearing an unufual murmur the 

mother queen appeared, with all her 

attendant train, to enquire who the 

bold intruder was? The way was 



cleared for her approach, and a 
folemn lilence prevailed, while the 
ftranger, with unfeigned humility, an- 
fwered to the queftion. No fooner 
did her majelly know her returning 
child, than in one loud hum fhe ex- 
prelTed her fatisfaclion, and this was 
heard and attended to by all around, and 
prefently the general voice was that 
he mould be re-admitted. 

" I am not returned unto you 
fick, or unable to work," replied the 
delighted Bee, after he had expreff- 
ed his thanks for their generous re- 
ception of him ; and then related to 
his attentive and fympathyzing pa- 
rent all he had gone through fince 
he had fo rafhly left the hive, whilft 
the reft waited till the clofe of the 
day before they indulged their curio- 
fity by hearing it, nor did he forget 





to acknowledge that it was to the 
attention of a Butterfly that he owed 
his life. 

"A Butterfly/' returned the queen, 
whofe dignity felt hurt that any 
of her race fhould be indebted to 
fo trifling a creature, " fure you rnuft 
have been funk very low indeed,, to 
need the afliftance of a Butterfly." 

" I have learnt, my dear mother/' 
replied the young one, " that there 
is no creature., however mean, but may 
be of fervice fome time or other; the 
Butterfly is well aware of the great diffe- 
rence there is between us/' 

ft And fenfible, 1 hope, of the ho- 
nour done him, in being permitted 
to affift a Bee?" rejoined the mother. 

This important affair being fettled, 
though not entirely to the fatisfaclion 
of the queen, who while fhe forbore 





to fay more upon the fubjecl, refolved 
narrowly to watch the conduct of her 
fon, fearing he would gain too much 
of the frivolity of the Butterfly if he 
long affociated with him : and after 
Ihewing him a cell in which he might 
for the future refide, me left him to 
prepare it for his reception. 





CHAP. IV. 

" Think not that treachery can be just; 
" Take not informers' words on trust." 

GAY. 

As the winged inhabitants flocked 
towards home, laden with their honey- 
ed ftore, the return of the wanderer was 
announced to each; and the labors of 
the day being ended, they all gathered 
round him to hear the account of his 
adventures. 

In the mean time the Butterfly con- 
tinued without the hive, not unplea- 
fantly fituated, as a number of flowers 
were about the place, had he not been 
yet in fufpenfe refpefting his friend,, 
when, as he was juft going to give up 
all hopes of meeting with him till the 
next morning, he had the pleafure of 
feeing him come out upon the block, in 




company with two or three other Bees. 
" Will he fpeak to me now, that theft 
are with him," thought the Butterfly, 
and he fluttered round the place, half 
afraid that he ihould find the promifes 
of his friend forgotten; but not fo, the 
Bee,, (though perhaps he might feel a 
little at the opinion he judged would 
be formed by his prefent affociates on 
feeing him fpeaking familiarly to one 
fo much beneath them,) flew towards 
him, to tell him he had been well re- 
ceived, directing him to a place of fafe- 
ty in which he might pals the night ; 
" to-morrow," faid he, " we fhall meet 
again." 

The Butterfly was much pleated at 
this unexpected interview, and after 
thanking him for his attention, promif- 
ed to join him in the morning. The 
Bee then returned to his companions. 




and the Butterfly retired to the place 
which had been pointed out to him, 
and from whence he could fee the en- 
trance of the hive, and watch the com- 
ing of his friend when they were next 
to meet. 

I (hall now proceed to acquaint my 
reader with the future travels of our 
two friends, and without attending to 
the minute occurrences of each day, 
enter at once upon thofe events which 
more particularly belong to my defign. 
As foon as the fun was fufficientl} above 
the earth, the inhabitants of the hive 
haftened forth, eager to purfue their 
daily talk 

" Around, ath\vart, 

" Thro' the soft air the busy nations fly." 

And among the firft came our young 
adventurer, whom the Butterfly imme- 
diately prepared to accompany; though 




till he faw him a little feparated from 
the others, he did not prefume to ap- 
proach. a How do you do, my friend?" 
faid the Bee, as foon as he drew near; 
" are you inclined for a long flight to- 
day ? I have now a double motive to 
work hard, having a wifh to make up 
for my loft time, as well as to fhew my 
fenfe of gratitude for the reception I 
have met with from the friends I am re- 
turned to." 

ei 1 am willing to accompany you/* 
replied the Butterfly, '*' and am glad to 
fee you in fuch fpirits; but you are 
already eyeing fome of thofe beautiful 
flowers, and while you are engaged with 
them I will vifit the neareft cottage, 
and return before you have rimmed 
your talk." 

(e That's right," replied the Bee, 
" and tell me if you find the inhabi- 




tants as well, or as bufily employed, as 
I am going to be." 

The Butterfly departed, and on en- 
tering the window of the humble 
dwelling, he perceived a woman fweep- 
ing out the lower room,, " which 
ferved them for parlour, kitchen, and 
hall," and preparing the breakfaft ; 
three or four children were entrufted 
to the care of another fomewhat 
older than themfelves, and who was 
endeavouring to keep the little ones 
from entering, and interrupting their 
mother. The Butterfly was unnoticed 
by the woman, but no fooner did the 
children fee it, who (like all others, 
wanting what is denied them,) were 
peeping in at the door and enquiring 
when they might come in, than a little 
boy begged to enter, promising to catch 
it in a minute, and his entreaties at laft 





prevailed, though he did not find it 
quite fo eafy to take the nimble crea- 
ture as he had fancied. He had again 
and again to watch its fettling, and to 
experience difappointment in his en- 
deavour to fecure it; while the reft of 
the little ones were at the door eagerly 
looking on, and the mother fometimes 
fretting,, and fometimes laughing at his 
fruitlefs efforts; when all at once the 
eldeft girl gave notice of her father's 
approach to breakfaft. 

No fooner was this intelligence 
heard, than the Butterfly was fuffer- 
ed to reft in quiet ; the mother declar- 
ed that (C nothing was ready ;" fhe 
fcolded the child and blamed herfelf 
for being fo foolifh as to be flopped 
in the middle of her work by the 
chacing of a Butterfly, and before any 
*hing was in proper order the maf- 





ter entered, who by his rough voice and 
peremptory manner feemed determined 
to keep up the authority of that title. 
While he was grumbling at not finding 
his breakfaft ready,, and his children 
(landing filent around the table, the 
Butterfly, happy to efcape, extended 
his wings, and returned to his compa- 
nion, whom he found ftill employed at 
his accuftomed tafk. 

" Well, what difcoveries have you 
made/' enquired the Bee, " have you 
feen any one fo bufy as me ?" 

ct One was/' replied the Butterfly, 
laughing, " till I put an end to her 
work; a little humoured brat of a boy 
was fuftered to enter into the midft 
of it, and hunt me from one fide of 
the reom to the other, and this foolifh 
purfuant took the attention of the WO-T 
man, who flood with the broom in her 


hand, admiring the dexterity of her 
aukward cub, I fuppofe, till the ap- 
proach of the father was announced; 
then the fcene was entirely changed, 
the hunt was given over, and fhe was 
crofs with herfelf and every one elfe 
becaufe (he had been interrupted, 
which after all was her own fault ; the 
man came in (till more out of humour, 
and thus the houfe which at your firft 
entrance you might have imagined the 
abode of peace and domefiic comfort, 
was made direclly otherwife; and my 
harmlefs vifit, I dare fay, they would fay 
was the caufe of it; when to a reafon- 
able obferver it would be plain that the 
whole of his difturbance arofe from the 
wayward fancy of the child, the indul- 
gence of the mother, and the ill temper 
of the father : however, fuch is my hap- 
py lot, having wings, 1 could fly away 





from all their troubles, but thofe are to 
be pitied who cannot efcape them." 

" During your abfence," faid the Bee, 
" I have feen two friends in this gar- 
don, who appeared fo happy in thefocie- 
ty of each other that I am anxious to 
fee more of them, fuch friendfhip being 
rather rare among the human race, 
and as foon as I have carried home this 
load of honey, I intend to vifit the houfe 
I faw them enter." 

" Do, do/' replied the Butterfly, 
pleafed to find his friend could attend 
to any thing befides his work, ec and 
while you are thus engaged, I will 
amufe myfelf with an old acquain- 
tance or two whom I fee yonder." 
With thefe words they parted for a little 
while, promifing to meet again in the 
fame place, and to which the Bee re- 
turned long before the fluttering But- 


terfly, who had flown to a neighbouring 
field, and there among the daifies and 
king-cups with which the ground was 
nearly covered,, he continued with his 
former afibciates nearly the whol e 
morning,, idly chacing each other in 
airy rounds till he had almoft forgot the 
engagement he had made, and was flill 
lefs inclined to regret his living an idle 
life. " I am not born to work," faid he, 
<e and if the place I fill in the world is 
not of fuch importance as my friends, 
as a Butterfly I have an equal right to 
live, and to follow my own inclination j" 
he therefore returned to meet him with- 
out an apology for being behind the 
time, and on finding him bufily em- 
ployed, and nearly ready to take home 
another load, <c what," faid he, " you 
could not leave your favorite work to 
make your intended vifit ? furely you 




are too intent in gathering that food 
which I fear you will never be allowed 
to enjoy ?" 

" You are miitaken," replied the 
Bee, " I have been, and feen the two 
ladies, but they are no longer friends^ 
Oh what fickle creatures thefe men 
and women are ! young and old, they 
are all changeable alike. One was 
fitting at an open window, and the 
other walking up and down the room 
apparently much diftreffed; u whatnot 
one word ?" faid me to the other; " I did 
not mean to offend you/' 

No anfwer was returned, and me 
continued to exprefs her forrow, 
which was received with the utmoft 
indifference; at length fhe made ano- 
ther attempt, and offering her hand 
to her offended friend, Ihe faid, 
*" f Come, -Charlottr, will you not be re- 
conciled ?" 




This alfo was equally di (regarded, 
and the feelings of the poor offender 
feemed entirely altered; fhe no lon- 
ger folicited forgivenefs, but left the 
room, faying, " It is not neceffary for 
me to acknowledge more ; you do not 
treat me like a friend; talk no more of 
your regard for me." 

As foon as fhe was gone the other 
began Tinging, as loudly as fhe could 
raife her voice, though the words fhe 
uttered now, fo far from being in 
unifon with her mind, as exprefTed in 
her countenance, that I could not help 
fmiling; they were defcriptive of con- 
tent and felf-fatisfaclion, neither of 
which I think Jlie could at that time 
feel. 

' On leaving her, and entering ano- 
ther window, I was forry to fee the 
oiae I had been interetted for in 
earneltconverfation with a third perlbn, 




, pitying her dejecled and melan- 
choly appearance, afked if fhe might not 
attribute it to the ill humour of her 
friend, and while her mind was thus hurt 
with the treatment fhe had received, 
drew from her a complaint which per- 
haps fhe would not have made at any 
other time. et She does not deferve 
your regard," faid the ftranger, " and 
you give up too much to her; if you 
continue to do fo, fhe will by and bye 
expect you to fay or do nothing but a s 
fhe direcls; and her friendfhip for you 
can never be real if fhe requires fuch 
fubjeclion." 

" Thefe are very odd things," 
obferved the Butterfly ; cf we poor 
infignificant creatures never have any 
thing of this fort; if we aflbciate toge- 
ther, we do not fpend our time in 
complaining of each other." 



" 1 have not done with them yet," 
returned the Bee, " but mean to pay 
them another vifit, and I fancy lhall 
fee flill more reafon to conclude 
that thefe wonderful creatures,, whom 
the animal race hold in fuch refpecl, 
are not fo fteady and conftant in their 
conduct and purfuits as either they, 
or we, the (till meaner infect tribes, 
are, though I muft fay thofe of the 
latter order are not in fo much awe 
of' them. We do not fly from them 
if they come in our way, but in many 
things confider them as furfervient to 
us, and that which they look upon as ex- 
clufively their own, and which a cat or 
a dog would not venture to touch, we 
have mod likely made many a meal 
from before it comes to their table." 

A few days after this, the Bee renew- 
ed his vifit, as he had propoied, and 




there was aftonifhed to fee the very fame 
third perfon now engaged with the 
other lady, and relating to her with 
many exaggerations all that her offend- 
ing friend had repeated to her, while 
fmarting under the efFecl of her ill hu- 
mour, though all the pains fhe took to 
draw it out of her, and the encourage- 
ment with which me liftened to her com- 
plaint, were entirely omitted in the re- 
cital. " Only think of this/' faid the 
Butterfly, on hearing an account of his 
friend s fecond vifit. " Is this the ufe 
they make of the power of fpeech, 
and which they imagine fets them fo 
completely above the animals? furely 
they had better be without it, than ufe 
it to fuch a purpofe ; but what will be 
the end of this? will not the eyes of the 
two friends be opened, think you ? and 
they will leave the acquaintance of that 




mean incendiary, who, under fuch a 
Ihow of friendfhip, endeavours to widen 
the breach between them ?" 

" Perhaps not/' replied the Bee, 
" Their conducl may yet want that con- 
iiftency ; I hope they will be reconciled 
to each other, but I doubt whether they 
will give up this perfidious acquain- 
tance, though the more their regard 
for each other increafes, the more muft 
their contempt for her be increafed. I 
queftion. alfo, if the tdejhe has this day 
told will not rankle in the breaft of the 
hearer for many future years,, and whe- 
ther there will ever again be that mutu- 
al confidence in the two friends which 
once appeared." 

The next houfe they faw, the Butter- 
fly entered alone, as the Bee obferved 
lome flowers at a diftance which ap- 
peared more worthy of his attention. 




While he was busily employed in ex- 
tragting their sweets,, his friend return- 
ed laughing, ' ' Oh ! said he, 1 wish you 
had been with me. Smile no more at 
the regard I shew to outward appear- 
ance; why there is a young man who is 
storming and raging about the house, 
because his neckcloths and shirts are not 
brought home so nicely as he expeded, 
and he is throwing them from one end 
of the room to the other, while the poor 
woman, who has, perhaps, been working 
hard to make them what they are, 
stands trembling before him, as if she 
had committed the greatest trespass in 
the world. The beauty of my wings^ 
if once destroyed, is lost for ever, but 
these evils, if they are any, are soon 
remedied ; and, at the next house/' 
continued he, <e is another instance of 
the vanity of the sex; there is a boy who 





has got a new coat just brought home 
from the taylor's, and because the day 
is rather lowering, and his father won't 
let him wear it out, he is determined 
not to go out at all, and he is now sit- 
ting in his own room with the coat on, 
though there is no one but himself to 
admire it. I have seen females carry 
their fondness for dress as far as this/* 
continued he, " but I thought men 
and boys were above such vanity; I 
declare I am half ashamed of them." 

At this moment a heavy shower came 
on, and the Butterfly hastened to the shel- 
ter of a large leaf on a cucumber bed, 
where also the Bee was obliged to se- 
cure himself, nor could he take home 
the honey he had gathered till the rain 
had ceased. 

On his return, he found the Butterfly just 
ventured from his retreat, and stretch- 
ing his wings, he was enquiring of 





one of his own species, " if their qo. 
lours had received any injury ?" 

The Bee heard the enquiry, and 
though he believed his friend would not 
have made it had he thought him 
within hearing, he was not now so in- 
clined to laugh at him as formerly on 
account of it, fe for/' said he, " since 
I have heard such instances of vanity in 
a race so superior, I can forgive it in a 
Butterfly/' 

Qn finding that the drops still con- 
tinued on the flowers, so as to prevent 
his gathering any thing from them, 
he determined to return to the hive, 
and there assist in forming some cells 
with the wax he had been busy in 
procuring, though the Butterfly was 
earnest in desiring him to take an after- 
noon's flight with him, (f and enjoy a 
little pleasure/' 



The Bee smiled at what his friend 
called by that name; <c my enjoyment 
is to be usefully employed/' said he, 
tf and to receive my mother's approba- 
tion; but as I know this is a plea- 
sure you cannot understand, I would 
not wish to deprive you of what you 
can enjoy ; go, therefore, and take 
your fill of it while you may, and to- 
morrow perhaps we may meet again. 31 

His friend departed with this en- 
couragement, yet not able to compre- 
hend why all creatures did not find a 
pleasure in the same thing, though to 
the eye of reason such a distinction of 
enjoyments in the various objects of 
creation, is an evident token of the 
Wisdom with which they are formed,

SWIFT. 

THE next day the Bee had taken 
home two or three loads before his 
friend made his appearance, who, when 
he came, expressed his surprise at find- 
ing him where he was. " 1 have been 
in such a beautiful conservatory/' said 
he, " and surely I saw you there, al- 
most buried in the heart of a flower; 
and so intent were you upon your la- 
bour, that you would not even answer 
me when I called; there must certainly 
have been something very attractive to 
have kept you there so long, but how 
you got here before me is what I most 
wonder at." 



" I don't understand you," returned 
the Bee, " I have been in no conserva- 
tory, the utmost of my flights to-day have 
been from the hive to this place." 

" And have you really been no 
\vhere else ?" said the Butterfly in asto- 
nishment; <c why I never saw anything 
$o like you in my life; I concluded 
that you were so buried in the flower 
that you did not hear my call, or was 
unwilling to- move, lest you should 
plarm some ladies and gentlemen who 
were very near you," 

" I think I can tell what has deceiv- 
ed you," returned the Bee, fl you have 
seen a Bee-Orchis, as they are called, a 
flower .which bears both the form a~nd 
resemblance of our species. And so 
you really took it for me ?" 

'" If it was not yourself," replied 
the Butterfly, Cf and you wish to see 
your own likeness, pray come with me, 





and behold it; for never did I see one 
Bee so like another, as that flower is 
like you." 

" I have known many of our young 
ones who are not acquainted with it, 
said the Bee, tf so deceived by the re- 
semblance, that if they happen to meet 
with one, they pass it by, thinking, that 
one of their fellow-laborers is engaged 
there already ; but if you will fhew me 
the spot I will not be so put off." 

So saying, he followed the Butterfly, 
who was immediately on the wing; and 
soon arrived at a very large house, one 
end of which formed the conservatory. 
The fragrancy of the flowers it contain- 
ed, the great variety of them, and those 
of the most delicate nature, made the 
Bee clap his wings for joy. 

" Why, my dear friend," said he, 
" you have brought me to a treasure, 
house indeed; a store of sweets, I can 





hardly forbear returning to call all my 
companions to share it with me ; I am 
sure there would be work enough for 
the whole hive were they here." 

While he was thusexpressinghisdelight., 
the Butterfly was searching for the flower 
he had noticed before,, hardly satisfied* 
till he had the testimony of his own eye- 
sight in seeing them together, that his 
friend had told him the truth; however^ 
when he discovered it, and saw the Bee 
still flying about in admiration, he wa s 
obliged to acknowledge he had been 
wrong. 

The Bee employed himself here for 
some hours, during which he had gone and 
returned from the hive several times, 
bringing with him a few of his compa- 
nions, who were attracted by the account 
he gave of this charming place; the 
Butterfly also met with much to amuse 
him, and continued uninterruptedly to 





enjoy themselves, till, as the evening 
advanced, they resolved to visit some 
other part of the house, and the But- 
terfly led the way to the dining parlour, 
where some ladies and gentlemen were 
sitting after dinner, with a variety of 
fruits and wines before them. The at- 
tention of the Bee was immediately 
attracted by a very fine peach one of 
the ladies had just taken on her plate, 
and little thinking of the consequence 
of his temerity, he flew towards it : the 
lady screamed, and pushed back her 
chair, while the company eagerly en- 
quired the cause* 

" Oh, a Bee !" exclaimed she, '< I 
am frightened to death if I see one." 

" And I," said another, who sat op- 
posite to her, (e shall faint, if it comes 
near me; I really cannot bear it in the 
room." 

At this moment the Beei as if de^ 





sirous of seeing whether she spoke 
truth or not, flew directly across the ta- 
ble, and alighted on her head. 

" Oh where is it ?" said she, jumping 
off her seat, " I am sure it is on me ! 
dear Mr. Wippersnap," addressing the 
gentleman who sat next her, " for 
goodness sake take it off! what shall I 
do ?" 

While the other lady sat fanning to 
recover her alarm, and the rest of 
the party with anxious looks watched 
the motions of the bold intruder, the 
gentleman, proud of his superior cou- 
rage, " begged them not to be alarmed, 
for he would destroy it in a moment;" 
and giving it a gentle touch to drive it 
from its present station, he began the 
attack with an open knife he held in his 
hand, professing that he would cut it 
asunder at one blow; his blows, however, 
were not so decisive, for though he 





aimed several, the Bee contrived to es- 
cape them all. 

At this one or two other gentlemen, 
with more regard to the imaginary feel- 
ings of the ladies than to the reality of 
those belonging to the Bee, raised the 
same weapons in their defence, but all 
their efforts served only to exasperate 
the object of their rage, while the But- 
terfly sat trembling under the most cruel 
apprehensions for his friend's safety. 

During this alarming battle the ladies 
were happy to leave the room ; and no 
sooner were they retired than the fight 
was over, he weapons of war were laid 
aside, and the enraged Bee suffered to 
rest upon the table, and recruit his 
strength : his fierce opponents declared 
they were never so foiled before, till 
one, less courageous than the rest, wise- 
ly, as he thought^ turned an empty wine 




glass over him, and thus was* our unfor- 
tunate adventurer again in a close con- 
finement. The Butterfly was now 
alarmed for his friend from another 
cause, and feared the want of air would 
be too much for him. 

" Cruel monsters/' said he to himself, 
as he observed the gentlemen draw 
their chairs closer to the table, and fill- 
ing their glasses appeared determined 
to suffer no other interruption to their 
cheerfulness; " do they call themselves 
humane, who can leave a poor creature 
in that situation, and after they have cut 
and slashed at him in such a manner, 
that if their dexterity had been equal to 
their will, they would not have left a 
whole bone in his skin. Oh ! that I 
had the sting of a thousand Bees, 1 
would use them all to revenge his cause." 

With these words he fluttered round the 




table, and viewed his friend (who lay 
motionless at the bottom of his transpa- 
rent prison ) on every side; " he will 
certainly die," thought he, " if he is 
not dead already. Oh my friend ! \\ould 
that I could release you ! but the at- 
tempt would be fruitless." 

The gentlemen were too agreeably- 
engaged to observe the anxious Butter- 
fly,, who every time he saw them ex" 
tend their hands towards the place, ho- 
ped some little compassion had touch- 
ed their breasts, and that they were 
going to liberate his friend; but no 
tuch thing, the evening closed in, 
and he was ^et in confinement, till 
the tea being announced, the gentle- 
men jumped up to attend the ladies, 
and soon after the servants entering- 
to take away the bottle and glasses, 
give the poor prisoner an opportu- 





nity to escape. The window was still 
open, upon the edge of which sat the 
expecting Butterfly, but it was some 
time before the Bee, who had been in- 
sensible the greatest part of the time, 
could so far recollect himself as to know 
where he was, or who was waiting for him, 
On seeing him slowly crawling on the 
table, the Butterfly concluded he was too 
much hurt to fly, and coming towards 
him, with the utmost tenderness he said, 

fe Oh ! my friend, are you not cruel- 
ly wounded ?" 

" Not so much as I expected,'* re- 
turned the Bee, greatly revived at the 
sight of his old companion. " I am 
very stiff from the blows I have received, 
but luckily my wings are not hurt: 
pray lead the way from this detested 
spot, and I will follow with the greatest 
pleasure." 





With this request the Butterfly 
gladly complied, rejoicing to hear his 
friend speak so cheerfully, who was 
no sooner out of the house than he beg- 
ged to rest upon a neighbouring tree. 

" You have been very roughly 
handled/' said his friend, " by these 
superior sort of people; I had hoped 
better things of them 3 because they are 
called so,, but I do not find their hearts 
are better, or their conduct towards us 
less reprehensible than those of a lower 
order; but why did you not use your 
sting, my friend ? 1 think it then would 
have made even those courageous gen- 
tlemen sound a retreat." 

" I am very careful of extending 
that/' replied the Bee, " as it is very 
seldom we can use it to any advantage 
without leaving it in the wound, and 
that in general is fatal to us ; a gentle 
touch is sufficient in our defence, 





but here it would have had no effect 
but to enrage them still the more, and 
I must either have died by their hands, 
or soon afterwards by losing it; but what 
a fuss the ladies made at my approach, 
did they not ? did you ever see any thing 
so foolish, as all to run away from my 
presence? Why many of their fellow- 
creatures, whom they judge inferior in 
education and ideas to themselves, 
would have been ashamed to have act- 
ed so/' 

(S If you are inclined to put them to 
flight again/' said the Butterfly, <( I 
think I see the same party in the room 
above." 

tf No, I thank you/ 1 returned the 
Bee, " I must hasten to the hive as fast 
as my bruises will let me ; they will be 
quite alarmed at my being out so late, 
or feucy that my old fondness for wan* 





dering is come on again, and I should 
be sorry that should be their opinion; 
besides/' continued he, shrugging his 
shoulders, " I have had enough of the 
company of ladies and gentlemen for 
to-day, though no doubt I lost much 
entertaining conversation during my 
captivity." 

" I believe not/' replied the Butter- 
fiy, tc for my part I heard them say very 
little else than " the bottle is \vith you 
Sir," and " let us have another;" and 
" will you give us a toast, Sir ?'' 

te And is it thus these men of educa- 
tion converse together?' replied the Bee; 
<f I am astonished at it, but were we 
to sit and talk of it the whole of the night 
we should not make them better; we will 
therefore go home; 1 have only to say 
that I am glad I have escaped their ma- 
lice, and am obliged to you, my friend, 





for the affection which prompted you to 
stay for me ;" and now extending their 
wings they soon arrived at the hive, 
which the Bee entered, and accounting 
for his late return received the congratu- 
lations of all his companions on his safety. 

The Butterfly found a resting- 
place near it, and the next day met his 
friend with anxious enquiries of " how 
he found himself?" The Bee was still 
stiff, and felt too much of the ill effects 
of his last visit to wish to accompany 
him on another, at present,, therefore he 
remained but just without the hive, and 
left the Butterfly to make ' the voyage 
of observation' by himself. In the 
evening, as they again met, he enquired 
into the result of his rambles. 

" I am more and more astonished at 
the weakness of mortals," returned the 
Butterfly, " and am convinced that a 




Jine lady will believe any thing, and will 
be pleased with the greatest nonsense, if 
said to her by way of compliment; 
though I have visited but one house to- 
day, and that was with one of my old 
acquaintance, with whom I flew about 
till we chaced each other into a spa- 
cious drawing-room, in which sat a 
young lady, who was endeavouring to 
lay the imitation of flowers upon a 
small table; I believe they call it paint- 
ing, and it was nearly finished ; a gen- 
tleman sat by her, and seemed to ad- 
mire every stroke of her pencil, though 
for my part I could not see any thing 
so very admirable in it; the colours, to 
my eye, were put on very roughly, and 
I could not have thought he would have 
paid so ill a compliment to her under- 
standing, as to suppose she would have 
believed him, when on our .settling on 




them after we had sported round the 
room, he declared that we took them 
for natural flowers." 

" And did she believe him ?" asked 
the Bee. 

" She smiled," returned the Butter- 
fly, <f and seemed very much pleased ; 
and it is certain that she did not contra- 
diet him, though she soon drove us 
off again, fearing, I suppose, that we 
should discover the deception ; but we 
had done that long before, and only 
fixt ourselves there because it was the 
nearest place to rest on. After this we 
flew out, and met with other compa- 
nions, and I don't know how it was, but 
the day seemed gone before we were 
aware; however, we have enjoyed our- 
selves without interruption, and you, I 
hope, are better able to pursue what 
affords you pleasure, than when I 
left you in the morning?'* 



" I am recovering very fast, ' re- 
turned the Bee, " and it is quite ne- 
cessary I should, for I believe a won- 
derful change is soon to take place in 
my circumstances, and you must not 
be surprised if you should not see me 
in this neighbourhood much longer." 

" What do you mean?" enquired the 
Butterfly, half alarmed, though he knew 
not from what cause; " you are not go- 
ing to hide yourself from me, are you?" 

< c No/' returned the Bee ; " our 
movements cannot be hid, we shall make 
noise enough about it, but I am not at 
liberty to disclose the secrets of the 
hive; to-morrow, perhaps, if you keep 
a good look-out, and the weather is fine, 
you may see what will unravel this mys- 
tery; in the meanwhile assure yourself 
of the continuance of my friendship, 
anddo not think, after the attention I 



 

experienced from you last night, and 
on a former occasion, I can forget you." 
With this assurance the ButterflysufFer- 
ed his friend to depart without making 
any farther enquiry, and sheltering 
himself for the night under a large hol- 
ly-hock, resolved not to let the sun arise 
without his awaking to observe the 
movements of the Bee, and his compa- 
nions; and, if possible, to find out the 
meaning of what he had heard.

THOMPSON. 

THE next morning all was bustle and 
activity in the hive at a very early 
hour, and the Butterfly also arose, and 
shook his wings, determined to let no- 
thing escape his observation which could 
discover the occasion of it: but though 
there seemed much noise within, no 
one came out; and, after waiting a great 
while, he began to think that nothing 
particular, was intended by what his 
friend had said, or that some confusion 
among themselves prevented their put- 
ting it in execution. He frisked about 





among the flowers, yet still contrived to 
keep the hive in view; till at length he 
saw a Bee advance, whom, from her ma- 
jestic appearance, he concluded was 
the queen ; a number of attendants im- 
mediately followed her; and, among 
the rest, his friend. She turned as if to 
take a last look at the home she was 
about to leave for ever, and on seeing 
multitudes of its inhabitants flocking 
out, as fast as the narrow entrance 
would allow, appeared to glory in the 
exulting throng; till raising her wings 
she led the way to seek some other ha- 
bitation. Immediately all the train fol- 
lowed her example, and the air was 
filled with the numerous retinue; who, 
by the noise they made, Appeared to 
vie with each other in paying her re- 
spect. All were earnest in their endea- 
vours to get near her, and to the eye of 





the Butterfly,, who followed at an hum- 
ble distance, they appeared a formida- 
ble phalanx; eager not only to prevent 
the approach of danger, but that even 
the eye of a stranger should be fixt 
upon her. Presently a crowd of peo- 
ple, from the neighbouring houses, 
came running towards them, with pot- 
lids in their hands, with which, as the 
whole body were slowly hovering round 
the trunk of an old tree, they endea- 
voured to drown their humming noise 
with a much louder one of their own; 
and this, from what they said, and their 
calling for the hive, the Butterfly learnt 
\vas to make them sooner settle. All 
this time it would have been difficult to 
have said who watched their motions 
most attentively, the men and women, 
or the Butterfly. As soon as her offi- 
cious attendants would give her an op- 
i 




portunity, her majesty fixt her feet 
upon a projecting branch, and happy 
were those who could cling the closest 
to her. All were now as desirous of 
fixing with her, as before they were of 
flying; and when they could no longer 
see or touch this sole object of their at- 
tention, they were still eager to press, 
and hang upon each other, as if pleased 
to touch but the back of a bee, who per- 
haps touched another that had hold 
of their Queen. 

The noise now ceased, and the bees 
were suffered to hang, unmolested, fon 
nearly an hour, in a large round clus- 
ter; still and motionless, as if no life 
or power was in them. Their pro. 
ceedings were so entirely new to the 
Butterfly, that, had not his friend beer 
amongst them, he should have wished t< 
see the end; but he saw a man approach 





whose face and arms were entirely 
covered, and placing a new hive under 
them, he shook the branch till the 
whole united body fell into it. A 
cloth was then thrown over them, and 
he bore it away in triumph. 

ee And will they suffer themselves to 
be thus taken ?" thought his attentive 
observer, as he eagerly extended his 
wings to follow the man ; <c will they 
be content to remain in that desolate 
habitation without a cell, or any provi- 
sion in it? no, no; the man will soon 
perceive his mistake," continued he, as 
he saw him place it on a block, which 
had been before prepared for it, " as 
soon as they can get their liberty, they 
will return from whence they came." 
However, it was himself, and not the 
man, who was mistaken; on the whole, 
the Bees liked their new abode very 





well; and it was not till the next day 
that he saw any of its inhabitants com- 
ing out in search of food; when he met 
his friend, who asked him "if he did 
not think he had given him notice of 
something worth seeing ?" 

fe I think I see that you have chang- 
ed for the worse/' returned the Butter- 
fly; " you have left a full hive with 
comfortable cells, and plenty of food, 
for one which is destitute of both !" 

" We shall soon get this as well 
stocked RS the other," replied the Bee; 
" but did you not see our Queen ? a 
sight of her is seldom had ; were you 
not charmed with her majestic appear* 
ance?" 

" Upon my word, no," said the But- 
terfly with a smile ; " but you must re- 
collect that I am not one of her nume- 
rous progeny; and to the eye of a But- 





terfly she is no more than another of her 
species; but why did you leave your 
home? is it grown old, and crazy ; or 
does it let the rain in ?" 

" I fancy we understand building bet- 
ter than for that to be the case," answer- 
ed the Bee, somewhat offended ; " but 
we were too full; weencreased so fast that 
there was not room for us all in one 
hive. We have therefore chosen ano- 
ther queen, in whom, by the bye, I am 
astonished that you see nothing to ad- 
mire ; and we young ones are come 
forth with her, to form another settle- 
ment. Happy shall we be to contribute 
to her tranquillity and comfort, and to 
supply her every want; while she is 
kind enough to permit us to call her 
ours, for the present ; therefore, you 
must not expect to see me one moment 
at leisure ; till we have, in some degree, 





given our abode the appearance of an 
habitation., we cannot be comfortable; 
\ve have already formed a cell for our 
beloved Queen, and a few others for 
her principal attendants; among which 
number, I am proud to say, I am; 
you must excuse me if I now leave you 
abruptly, as I am on the search for some- 
thing nice for her to eat." 

<e Proud, indeed," thought the But- 
terfly, as he saw jhis friend hastily de- 
part. " Why, I am hardly spoken to 
now this new queen is come in the 
way. Well," continued he, " I am glad 
we have no sovereign, in whose service 
we might spend our lives. Our time is 
our own, and we enjoy it as we like/' 
added he, clapping his wings, and flying 
off in pursuit of some companion as 
thoughtless as himself. The next morn- 
ing he returned very early to the hive 





in hopes of seeing his old friend, though 
he did not suppose he would allow him 
his company for more than a minute. 

ef We can converse together as we 
fly," said the Bee, who advanced to meet 
him, (C but I must fetch some honey 
for her majesty's breakfast; won't you 
accompany me? we still go on build- 
ing very fast, and wax is brought in 
great abundance for that purpose." 

" While you are thus employed, I do 
not expect to have much of your compa- 
ny,*' said the Butterfly, t: and have there- 
fore made an agreement with some of my 
old acquaintance to take an excursion 
into the country, and enjoy ourselves 
there for a few days. The summer is 
passing quickly away, and our lives, 
supposing no accident cuts us off, must 
end with it; we must, therefore, frisk 
while we may." 




" Certainly/' replied the Bee, "you 
were made for that purpose, and by the 
lime you return I shall probably be 
more at liberty; we have a great deal to 
do, but there is likewise a number of 
hands, all able and willing to assist;" 
and directing his friend to find out the 
hive when he came back, he wished him 
much pleasure, and thus they parted for 
3 short time, the one to play, and the 
other to work, though both equally 
pleased with the pursuit they were 
about to follow. 

The Butterfly soon after joined his 
gayer friends, and sailing high in air, 
they winged their way, to " range the 
forest's green retreat." 

" These thro* the tangled wood -walks play, 
" Where no rude urchin paces near, 
*' Where sparely peeps the sultry day, 
f ( And light dews freshen ail the air." 





Thussported the happy party, uninter- 
ruptedly enjoying the live-long day, 
and resting at night within " the lily's 
bell!" They skimmed the purple heath, 
visited the rivers' brink, and each day 
brought some new pleasure in their 
view, till at length the weather began 
to change, a cold wind blew, and there 
was every appearance of an approach- 
ing tempest; and now it was that the 
Butterfly began to think of his friend 
the Bee, and of his warm comfortable 
hive; though he knew he could not be 
admitted there, he felt that it must be 
very pleasant to have such an asylum 
to retreat to. Every one of his flutter- 
ing companions were now flying away, 
each desirous of finding a place of safe- 
ty for himself, and he still bent upon re- 
turning to his more steady friend, endea- 
voured to gain the way which led to his 




abode, though the wind was now so pow- 
erful that he could scarcely bear against 
it, or see the way he was taking. At this 
moment a stage-coach passed him, and 
though he did not know it would convey 
him from the place he was then in, he 
was glad to take the shelter it afforded, 
and flying in at one of the open win- 
dows he soon found a resting-place. 
After recovering from the disorder and 
confusion the rough wind had put him 
into, he had time to examine where he 
\vas, and noticed two young ladies, and 
an officer very gayly drest, apparently 
confined within this very small space. 

" What's this ?" exclaimed the gen- 
tleman ; " a Butterfly ! we want no such 
intruders here; ladies, are you alarmed? 
is the creature disagreeable ? 

" Let the poor thing alone," said an 
elderly man, whom the Butterfly had 





not observed before, " its as free to 
live as you are; 'tis true we have frivoli- 
ty enough in our cargo, but the horses 
won't feel this addition to it." 

" It has taken shelter from the 
storm/' said one of the ladies, not at all 
regarding what he said; " and if it does 
not settle on me it is welcome to re- 
main." The coachman now got ofitfiis 
box,, and opening the door, begged to 
know if there was room for a young wo- 
man, who was on the outside. 

" It rains hard," said he, " and she 
will be wet to the skin if she stays 
there." Instead of answering his en- 
quiry the officer, in a low voice, replied 
thus: " I say, who is this old fellow in 
the corner ? any one of consequence ? 
hey?" 

" Oh bless you, no Sir, he won't 
nrind hes coming in, if you don't/* 





" Mind her coming? no, I suppose 
not/' replied, he, " but the ladies are 
to be consulted; what say you ladies? 
have you any objection ?" They looked 
at each other as if hesitating for an 
answer, which the old gentleman ob- 
served, and immediately offered to get 
out, and let her have his place; at this 
the whole party seemed rather ashamed, 
and one of the ladies replied, " Oh dear 
BO! we only thought her clothes might 
be wet." 

" And spoil yours,, I suppose ?" re- 
turned the old gentleman rather rough- 
ly, " but I dare say you will have no 
objection to this young officer's sitting 
between you, and then she can take his 
place, and you will be in no danger." 

This proposal was readily acceded to, 
and the young woman cameinwithmany 
thanks, while the gallant gentleman 




seated between the two ladies declared, 
that f< if he did not incommode them 
he was the happiest man alive, and only 
wished that they were going to travel 
hundreds of miles together." 

<f An enviable situation truly," said 
the old man, with an air of contempt, 
and folding his arms, as if preparing to 
sleep; ff l,"said one of the ladies, " shall 
soon be at my journey's end," naming 
the place at which she was to be set 
down; " and I," replied the other, "am 
to go but one mile further. 3 ' 

" Oh! Heavens! and what shall I 
do then?" returned their admiring beau, 
" shut up in this place by myself; I 
shall certainly hang myself if I have 
an opportunity ! what lose such charflti- 
ing companions so soon ?" At this the 
ladies both smiled, and seeing such sort 
of conversation pleased, he plied therm 





with it very freely, while the old man 
slept, or pretended so to do, and the 
young women looked rather inclined 
to blush for those of her sex who could 
receive such flattery. 

When one of the ladies left the 
coach, the other seemed fearful that 
their complimenting admirer would 
hurt himself, in straining his neck to 
look after her, as she ran through the 
rain to a house which stood at a little 
distance from the road. On drawing 
his head in again, he praised her beauty 
exceedingly, till fearing he should car- 
ry his encomiums too high, so as to of- 
fend the other, whose countenance al- 
ready bespoke an approaching gloom ; 
he dissipated the very appearance of it 
in a moment, by " begging to know if 
they were not sisters, their likeness to 
each other was so great ?" This had the 





desired effect, for though she assured 
him they were not, yet if her compa- 
nion was handsome, and they were alike, 
she must be so likewise. To be handsome 
is as much as some people desire, 
thought the Butterfly, on observing her 
face resume a smile, " no wonder that we 
Butterflies should wish it." After some 
more conversation equally foolish, she 
also arrived at the place of her destina- 
tion, and the gentleman, not at all re- 
garding his other companions, again de- 
plored the melancholy situation he 
should be left in. 

As soon as the lady was gone, the old 
gentleman thus addressed him, " Young 
man, I think you have shown your folly 
whilst you have been attempting to 
hoax those women; that's the word, is it 
not?" 

" Poor country girls!" replied the 





officer, laughing, f( how pleased they 
were; they believed every word I said; 
they look as if they had never been be- 
yond their own country town, and yet I 
made one of them think that I suppo- 
sed she had lived in London all her 
life." 

"And where have you lived?"replied 
the old man, " to learn that there is 
any wit in making people appear more 
ridiculous than they really are ?" 

" Oh," said the other," they'll go home 
and talk of me for days to come ; I 
should not wonder if they expected to 
see me returning in search of them with- 
in a short time, as not being able to live 
out of their company." The old gen- 
tleman then turned to the young wo- 
man, who had sat a silent spectator like 
the Butterfly, and bade her take a lesson 
from what she had seen and heard, noj 




to believe what was said to her; "you 
may perhaps one day or other meet 
with an idle fellow," continued he 
" who may think proper to amuse him- 
self by talking thus, but do not you pay 
so ill a compliment to your own under- 
standing, as to sit with a simper on your 
countenance at whatever nonsense he 
may chuse to utter." 

The young woman expressed her 
thanks, while the disconsolate beau sat 
with his head half out of the window, 
as if wishing to avoid any farther con- 
versation. 

The weather seemed now cleared 
away, the wind and the rain had ceased, 
and the Butterfly began to prepare for 
flight. On seeing this the old gentleman 
said, " Ah, go, poor harmlefs creature, 
I am glad for your sake, andthisyoung 
woman's, that I have travelled this way 




to-day, or neither of you would have 
been v admitted.*' 

Our adventurer would have thanked 

him if he could, and leaving the window 

had the pleasure of seeing he was very 

near the place he wished to be in ; he 

saw some hives at a distance, and among 

them was his friend's abode, who, on 

seeing his approach, came to meet him, 

and to whom the Butterfly, after they 

had expressed their pleasure at again 

being together, related the adventures 

he had met with, particularly the way 

in which he had been broughtback, 

and many were the moralizing remarks 

occasioned by the recital of what had 

passed during his ride. 

" The race bf human beings must 
certainly be degenerated," observed the 
Bee, " since all other creatures were 
first put under their subjection, and in 





no other way can I account for the supe- 
rior conduct, and in many respects the 
superior wisdom also, of those whom 
they think so much below them/' 

The Butterfly then asked in what 
state of forwardness the new hive was 
in, and was happy to learn, that during 
his absence they had nearly completed 
the building within it, and that his 
friend was now ready to accompany 
him on his flights as usual. 



CHAP. VII. 

" Not all that tempts your wandering eyes, 
" And heedless hearts, is lawful prize, 
" Nor all that glitters gold/' 

GRAY. 

IN the course of the next day the 
two friends met again,, and while the 
Bee did not forget the more important 
work of gathering food for the approach- 
ing winter, he did not so earnestly pur- 
sue it as to make him unmindful of 
other things, 

" See here," said he to the Butterfly, 
as they flew towards a house whose open 
windows seemed to invite their en- 
trance; " let us go in, I think we shall 
meet with something worth our notice ?" 
The Butterfly hastened on, but no soon- 
er had he reached the window than 
turning back, he winged his flight ano- 




ther way, with much greater speed, cal- 
ling to his friend to follow him. 

" What have you seen that has so 
alarmed you?" enquired the Bee, as he 
hurried after him, <c what is in that 
house so very frightful ?" 

" It belongs to a naturalist" replied 
the Butterfly, fe and don't you know 
what detestable creatures these are? had 
he seen me I should have lost my life in 
the cruelest manner." 

fc A naturalist!" returned the Bee, 
<c I never heard of one, what does he 
do?" 

'' Do ?" replied the trembling But- 
terfly, fe why, he would tear me limb 
from joint if I was in his power, and yet 
endeavour to preserve my life only to 
try how much he could make me suffer; 
did you not see how many of my spe- 
cies were pinned up against the walls 




of his room, whose peculiar form or co- 
lour had attracted his attention ? he 
thinks nothing of taking the life of 
any thing he admires. Oh ! it turns me 
sick to think of it; had I flown one inch 
farther I might have been thus impaled, 
and you also; no doubt you would not 
have escaped his observation, and for 
the sake of your sting, or examining 
what you carry your honey in, you 
would have been quickly dispatched; 
various are the instruments he has got 
about him, and numberless insects does 
he daily destroy." 

" These are detestable creatures in- 
deed/' answered the Bee ; " what can't 
they be satisfied with viewing our forms 
as we pass along, but must they pull us 
to pieces, by way of admiration? I 
fancy when they have taken the most 
accurate survey, they could not make 





either a Bee, or a Butterfly; it is a pity 
therefore that they should destroy that 
life which they can never give. I de- 
clare the more I see of these human be- 
ings, and think of their cruelty, as 
well as absurdities, it makes me almost 
determine to quit the haunts of men, 
and if it ever should be my lot again to 
seek another habitation, I would use all 
my influence with my fellow Bees in 
order to remove to some wild wood 
where they might never find us." 

" You would be perfectly right,'* 
returned the Butterfly ; <f as for us, if we 
escape them one summer, we willingly 
resign our lives at the end of it, and 
led by instinct seek a place in which 
we die unlamented, and soon forgotten ; 
but this is not the case vfithyou; while 
you live you are useful, and at your 
death a whole society feels your loss; 




but look/' continued he, pointing to- 
wards a bottle that hung tied to the 
branch of a fruit-tree, in which were 
several wasps decoyed thither by the 
liquid it contained, and dying in the 
sweets they sought, " there is another 
instance of their malice, don't you see 
those poor creatures?" 

" Oh! yes," returned the Bee, ff and 
though I am no friend to wasps, who 
are often wishing to share the fruits of 
our labour, without having any right to 
them ; and in many things are striving 
to imitate us, though I believe their 
chief aim is to do mischief, yet I cannot 
justify men who use such mean arts to 
entrap them to their destruction ; but 
what is that I see in yonder window?" 
continued he with a hurried air, "some- 
thing that more particularly demands 
my attention, a Bee in distress ; and 




hark, he calls to me for assistance ;" so 
saying., without waiting for the Butter- 
fly to accompany him, he flew towards 
the place, where was a Bee nearly 
drowning in a pot of honey. " And 
one of my own hive too '."exclaimed he, 
as he drew nearer; " my dear brother, 
how came you in such a situation ?" 

(e Surely we are to see nothing but 
shocking sights to-day," observed the 
compassionate Butterfly, who had hasti- 
ly followed his friend, half afraid that 
something still more terrible had hap- 
pened, " bur," said he, on seeing the 
struggling captive, " he will not die; 
'tis certain he can keep his head above 
the edge till you have procured more 
assistance; I fear I am not strong enough 
to help to pull him out." 

While he was speaking, his companion 
had flown to the hive., and with incre- 


dible swiftness returned with more of 
the community, who altogether lent 
their aid, and after much toil and pains 
extricated the poor exhausted Bee from 
the ill effects of seeking too large a 
share of those sweets which only proved 
so, when moderately enjoyed, ' safe in 
themselves 'but dangerous in the ex- 
cess.' 

<c I only rested on the edge of the 
pan," said he, as soon as he could speak, 
" and after an unsuccessful flight was] 
glad to see a store of that which I had 
been so long searching for in vain; I 
thought I would just take a sip or 
two, and perhaps bring home a little of 
it to the hive." 

On hearing this one of the oldest of 
the throng thus addressed him : " Know, 
my brother, that what we make our- 
selves is only welcome there, and that 





food for which we labour hardest, is 
the sweetest to the palate of every in- 
dustrious Bee; idle drones and wander- 
ing wasps may sip the honey which 
others have prepared, but let the dan- 
ger you have escaped to-day teach you 
to use the powers nature has given you, 
and taste the sweets of your own procu- 
ring rather than that of others." 

The trembling Bee thanked him for 
his advice, and promising to follow it, 
he was escorted home by all the train, 
where he met with other assistants, who 
cleared away the clammy substance that 
still encumbered him, and he was suffer- 
ed to rest within all that day to recover 
himself. Meanwhile, the Butterfly waited 
without the hive, till his friend returned, 
and they renewed their flight. 

Nothing particular met their eye til! 
they passed some flies, who were round 



a piece of horse-flesh, the smell of which 
discovered where it lay, and its half 
devoured state shewed the avidity with 
which these buzzing insects fed upon it. 
" See," said the Bee, " what oppo- 
site natures are within the circle of cre- 
ation. These devouring flies find as 
much pleasure in eating from this stink- 
ing carrion, as from the choicest honey ; 
nay, perhaps this is more agreeable to 
them, though nothing in which they 
can thrust their devouring trunks es- 
capes their taste, but with this delicious 
morsel, that really poisons the surround- 
ing air, they are so delighted, that they 
even chuse it for an habitation likewise. 
Here they lay their eggs, and bring 
forth their young, and having no trou- 
ble to hunt for food for them, they 
spend their time in flying round it, till 
their habitation and provision being 





gone together, they are obliged to 
seek another residence equally conve- 
nient. " Though you bear the same 
name, my friend," continued he, " I am 
witness that you have not their nature." 
" Their nature!" interrupted the 
Butterfly, half offended at being men- 
tioned together, " no ! I hope not, or 
their name either ! what, shall the 
beautiful winged tribe of Butterflies be 
put upon a footing with these carrion- 
eaters, who live upon what, even in 
our crawling state, we should reject 
with disgust. If I may speak my opi- 
nion, I think their form, and the noise 
they make while flying, is more like 
your race than ours, though alas ! in one 
respect, I feel myself too closely allied 
to them, that is, I must shortly resign 
my being ; the date of my life will 
soon be ended; I have felt the chilling 



blast of the morning air long before 
you are out of your hive, and if you are 
not already aware of it, can give you 
notice that winter is approaching." 

" Indeed/" replied the Bee,, " I have 
seen some tokens of it myself; the 
flowers are not in such plenty, and as 
their faded leaves fall off, no young 
buds are seen to supply their place; 
however, such is the use which we have 
made of the summer, that we are not 
afraid to look forward to the time when 
every outward resource shall fail : but, 
my friend, I fear you are of too delicate 
a frame to live through the winter, 
though the place of your retreat be ever 
so warm ; but have you not thought of 
where you will retire to ?" continu- 
ed he. 

" A place to die in is easily found," 
replied the Butterfly, (t and you must 





not be surprised if you see me no more; 
the damps of the night will soon prove 
fatal, and I know not if I shall survive 
another. "" 

" Do not speak so," returned the 
Bee," " how gladly would I afford you 
an asylum if it was in my power; how- 
ever, I cannot let you resign your life 
so easily ; green leaves are yet to be 
found) and now, within our reach, I see 
a convenient crevice, into which you 
may creep; there cherish life as long as 
you can, my friend, and by only ventur- 
ing out when the sun shines brightly, 
you may perhaps extend your days be- 
yond their usual period, and have your 
name recorded, as a Butterfly who has 
survived the summer.' 1 

" Thank your kindness," returned 
fche short-lived insect, " my Jife has 
been already lengthened through your 





means, but you cannot renovate my 
nature ; may yours be extended." 

(C As long as it can be useful," said 
the Bee, interrupting him, ff but to you 
I owe all that I have gathered this sum- 
mer," added he; " for had it not been 
for your friendly and compassionate 
encouragement when first \ve met, I 
should have sunk a victim to the con- 
sciousness of deserved destruction; say 
not, therefore, that you have been of 
no use in the world." 

" I will not" returned the Butterfly, 
faintly fluttering his wings, as if with 
his last breath he was desirous of re- 
joicing it had been in his power to do 
good. 

From this time the poor Butterfly was 
still more sensible of the weakness of 
his frame, and flying towards the place 
hi* friend had pointed out, he entered, 





never to quit it more, " self-buried 'ere 
he died," for in the morning when the 
Bee visited the spot he was deaf to his 
voice, and his pitying friend had to la- 
ment the sudden change in one he had 
so very lately seen frisking about in all 
the gaiety of health and spirits. 

" Poor fly/' said he, " thou hast been 
faithful to me, and has even forgot thy 
wonted pleasures to afford me assist- 
ance; I will not leave thee to the de- 
vouring jaws of thy fellow insects, at 
least thy little body shall be preserved 
from being so destroyed," and with this 
resolution he spent one whole day in 
gathering wax, and stopping up the 
crevice which contained the remains of 
his friend all the return he could now 
make for his former kindness. After 
having given this last proof of affection, 
he returned to the hive, and there in 





the busy labors of the Commonwealth 
soon forgot the shock which the unex- 
pected death of his airy companion had 
occasioned. 

During that winter they were suffer- 
ed to remain unmolested, and as the 
ensuing summer approached, (accord- 
ing to the plan he had formed so long 
ago,) he proposed their taking a farther 
flight, and seeking a refuge in some 
solitary wood; e( I have seen more of 
mankind than you have, my friends," 
said he, " and have observed both their 
customs and manners; believe me, they 
are i nconsistent fickle creatures; their con- 
duct towards one another shows that they 
are not to be trusted; much more, then* 
have we reason to be afraid of them. You 
very well know it is in our power to live 
without their assistance; what is it which 
they procure us but just an empty shell 




for our habitation ? for this they expect 
our stock of honey, and to obtain it 
scruple not to take our lives! We have 
already seen, in the destruction of one 
or two of our neighbouring hives, the 
fate which awaits us; but could I per- 
suade all of my species to wing their 
flight beyond their reach, they might 
be taught a little more humanity, and 
would perhaps spare our lives, if we 
were again in their power. Content to 
share with us what our labours have pro- 
duced, they might then leave us to die 
when our exhausted nature fails, and for 
their own sakes also would not cut us off 
in the prime of life, and while we have 
health and strength to add to the stock, 
which would be as much for their bene- 
fit as our own." 

This speech had the desired effect; 
.the whole community seemed roused by 




it, and entering into his scheme, on the 
appointed day not a Bee was left be- 
hind, but altogether mounting the air 
they winged their flight far beyond its 
usual extent, nor could all the clattering 
of pots and kettles make them settle, 
till clear of the noise and out of the 
sight of man they found an habitation 
for themselves, and under the covert 
of a thick wood passed the remainder 
of their days in peaceful industry.
