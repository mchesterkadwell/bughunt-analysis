are mutually dependent Each has a starting point from a simple cell the struc tural unit of the entire organized world The zoologist and the botanist ordinarily travelling in separate realms seem to meet on common ground while studying the lowest represen tatives of their respective groups Indeed some one has com pared the animal and vegetable kingdoms to two mountain peaks of unequal height whose adjoining bases rise from an elevated table land The naturalist discerns below a won derful simplicity and agreement in the scenes around him for life is there manifested in the simplest geometrical forms and there is no distinction between animals and plants But as he mounts farther up one or the other of tiie ascents his interest is continually excited by the numberless modifications of the simple forms beneath him and while he finds the loftier ele vation teeming with the myriad forms of animal life yet there constantly occur to him hints and analogies connecting the most complex and highly endowed organizations with the humblest forms he left below The question whether animals may not be spontaneously produced still remains an open one while the discovery of the aquarium wiiich reveals to us the delicate balance exist ing between animal and vegetable life and also the alleged necessity of the direct agency of insects in the fertilization of many plants are but examples of the multitudes of ways in Avhicli this dependence of plant and animal exhibits itself The theory of the science of agriculture now so far per fected seems adequate to the end Every year adds to the perfection of the seed to be sown as agriculturists are paying more attention than formerly to a careful selection of the best fruits and seed The chemistry of plants of nutri tion and absorption all the daily routine of plant life has been mapped out by Liebig and his followers The care of flocks and herds and their improvement have made our far mers actually better acquainted with the princiijles of inand in breeding or the secrets of natural selection than many naturalists Indeed the facts already brought out by prac tical writers on this subject are important contributions towards a theory of the method and permanent effects of specific variation a point now so interesting to naturalists Agricultural mechanics in its constant endeavor to lighten toil and economize time thus leading to the increased intel ligence of the laborer is daily enlarging its borders New inventions of reaping and ploughing machines and labor saving machinery of every description are constantly devised so that we may consider the theory of agricultural science far advanced toward perfection Now come in some disturbing agencies such as tempests prolonged rains severe droughts rust mildew and injurious insects Their appearance cannot be prognosticated their direful effects once experienced cannot be immediately reme died nor the remedies Avhen discovered be always seasonably applied The last mentioned cause of disturbance will now engage our attention Nearly ever one can recall the sudden and simultaneous uprising of the army worm in New England during the summer of 1861 Its ravages have been known and dreaded yearly in the western states where at intervals it has done wide and extensive damage Though in a local history a catcrpillivr answering to the description of the array worm had been noticed in New England at long intervals since 1743 its appearance in 1861 took all by surprise as hosts of them appeared full grown and busy at tlieir work foraging upon our wheat and cereals cutting down field after field of grain as they marched their columns in dense black masses over stone walls and through fences often bridging ditches filled with tar or burning straw with the dead bodies of their comianions while tlieir ranks were thinned by hosts of do mestic fowls and other birds which followed hard upon their rear or disputed their onward march They had hardly be gun their work ia New York when their appearance was heralded in the vicinity of Boston But a few days elapsed and their simultaneous appearance in Bangor at the Forks of the Kennebec and tlie limits of civilization on the Penob scot River was announced in the papers and the cry of their coming was caught up on the river St John Millions of dollars worth of grain were lost to the country by the rav ages of this one species of caterpillar The same season the appearance of the grain aphis in hosts which blackened the tops of waving grain ripening for the harvest was no less marvellous as the insect had been comparatively unknown before The range of the grain aphis was still greater than that of the army worm Though hundreds of plant lice pitted against one army worm might produce less visible effects yet the continual depletion by these pygmies in drawing out the sap of the giain stalk must have told upon the quality of the grain and of the seed for several jears succeeding The strange history of the locust its wide spread migra tions its sudden appearance and departure the mysteries of its birthplace the ruin consetiucut on its devastations are familiar to every reader of the Uible and are repeated in ancient and modern accounts of oriental travel These scourges of mankind these insect Vandals and Goths have their family relatives in this country Rumors arc jcarly heard of immense flocks of grasshoppers Fig 1 a Caloptc nus spretus devastating immense tracts of soil in the farthest west and the racilic slopes of the Rocky Mountains In Nev England and the Canadas our most common grasshopper Fig 1 6 Caloptenus femurruhrum has at times emulated the bad fame of the eastern locust In Williamsons His tory of Maine it is stated that in 1749 and 1754 the common redlegged grasshoppers were very numerous and voracious no vegetables escaped these greedy troops they even devoured the potato tops and in 1743 and 1756 they covered the whole country and threatened to devour Fig 1 everything green Indeed so great was the alarm they occasioned among the peo ple that days of fasting and ¦ prayer were appointed on account of the threatened calamity Dr Harris thus quotes from P r e s i d c n t Dwights Travels Their h voracity extends to almost Destructive Grasshoppers i ii i every vegetable even to the tobacco plant and the burdock Nor are they confined to vegetables alone The gaiments of laborers hung up in the field while they are at work these insects destroy in a few hours and with the same voracity they devour the loose par ticles which the saw leaves upon the surface of pine boards and which when separated are termed sawdust The ap pearance of a board fence from which the particles had been eaten in this manner and which I saw was novel and sin gular and seemed the result not of the operations of the plane but of attrition At times particularly a little before their disappearance they collect in clouds rise high in the at mosphere and take extensive flights of which neither the cause nor the direction has hitherto been discovered I vas authentically informed that some persons cmplojed in raising the steeple of the church in NVilliamstown were Tvliilc stand ing near the vane covered by them and saw at the same time vast swarms of them flying far above their heads It is to be observed however that they customarily return and perish on the ver grounds which they have ravaged In the western plains the longwinged Caloptenus C sjyretus Fig 1 a is still more destructive I might also cite the annual loss sustained by the attacks of the wheat midge and Hessian fly the state of New York having lost according to Dr Fitch 812000000 worth of wheat in one jear 100000 bushels of wheat could be raised annually in the state of JMaine if it were not for these two insects Among the more formidable pests in the south and west are the cotton boll worm army worm and the chinch bug from which farmers annually lose thousands of dollars For the greater or less abundance of insects as one 3ear succeeds another one can readily understand that the vicis situdes of the climate the abundance of a particular kind of food the temporary absence of iarasites and external enemies are sufficient to account But for the vast numeri cal increase of insects which are ordinarily sehlom observed and whose lives at the most span but a few months or weeks ve cannot so satisfactorily account Moreover there are great injuries received from the long sustained attacks renewed annually of insects such as the wheat fly and farm and forest insects A late report of a committee of the French Senate which we find translated into the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal states that the wire worm consumed £100000 worth of corn in one department alone and was the cause of the deficient harvests which preceded 1856 Out of 504 grains of colza gathered at hazard at Versailles all but 29G had been ren dered worthless by insects The reduction of yield in oil was 328 per cent lu Germany according to Latreille the larva of a species of moth Psilura vionacha consumed whole forests In Eastern Prussia three years ago more than 24000000 cubic inches of fir had to bo cut down because the trees were attacked by insects In view of these facts let us now look at some points in the life of an insect Thougli the process of building up the tissues of the body by cell growth had not been distinctly enunciated Ilcrold had given in the remarkable plates to his Disquisitiones clear representations of the gathering of the cells and as the result the faint line of tissues just entering upon the threshold of life in outlines too vague to admit of a guess as to what the future animal might be Then the division of the elongated body into distinct rings and the gradual though but partial evolution of organs when antenna jaws and legs are all alike to the eye of the beholder leave it yet a question whether any further development is to be arrested here and the creature remain the lowest of its type or still pass on to higher grades following unerringly the law impressed upon its being The embryo itself sets the question at rest when it eats its way through its shell and after devouring its former habitation as it often does settles down quickly upon the leaf it is born upon and forthwith begins its riotous life Before Von Siebold had published his tract upon a parthe nogenesis among bees and moths it was currently believed that the bee grub was developed into a drone queen or neuter according to the quality of the food or bee bread it was fed with But this acute and painstaking ih3siologist by the aid of intelligent and scientific bee masters in Germany brought out these astonishing facts in the generation of in sects that the queen bee after her marriage flight far up in the air laid two sorts of eggs that while some of the eggs were at the will of the queen fertilized and produced Avorkers That is the production of young from a virgin insect others were deposited as barren eggs which however were found to hatch out drones It is also known that one of the 3oung worker larvae when phiced in a separate cell and fed upon a peculiar kind of bread became eventually a queen bee These facts give some clew to the anomalies in the gene ration of plant lice Fig 2 Bonnet ascertained that the spring brood of aphides were virgins which throughout the summer brought forth young alive In the fall of the year however winged individuals of both sexes appeared and during the winter the species was represented by eggs It has since been discovered by able anatomists with the aid of the microscope that these springborn aphides so wonderfully prolific throw off from a budstock by a Fig 2 Aphis or Plant Louse process analogous to the budding and leaving out of plants or to the dropping off of hydroid medusa3 from their polp stalks whole multitudes of young plant lice which mature rapidly without passing through the intermediate stages of egg larval and pupal life common to most insects As if nature in her exceeding haste to fill up her quotas of millions of ready made sappers and miners of vegetable life for the summer campaign had disregarded all rules in her otherwise well regulated house In this connection we may refer to Dr Fitchs enumeration of the number of the Cherry Aphis produced between the 15th and 23th of June and how these immense numbers are reduced by insect enemies This species commences to appear as soon as the leaves begin to put forth in the spring They bring forth their young alive during the continuance of warm weather These huddle around their parents upon the under surface of the leaves as closely as they can crowd themselves indeed they often are found two deep a portion of the colony standing upon the backs of the others requiring only suffi cient space between them to insert their beaks into the leaves to suck their juices The numbers which thus make out to stow themselves within a narrow compass are almost incred ible Upon the under surface of a small leaf threefourths of an inch long and half an inch wide I have counted upon one side only of the midvein one hundred and ninety of these lice Yet this leaf was not more densely covered than many others The surface of a small leaf but an inch long would therefore furnish ample space to accommodate a thousand of these insects Among the cherry trees alluded to above was a row of seven joung ones which had attained a height of about ten feet By counting the number of leaves upon some of the limbs and the number of limbs upon the tree I find a small cherry tree of the size above stated is clothed with about seventeen thousand leaves And at the time alluded to these leaves could not huxe averaged less than five or six hundred lice upon each and there were full a third more occupying the stems and the tips of the twigs Each of these small trees was therefore stocked with at least twelve millions of these creatures And yet so vigilant so sharp sighted and voracious were their enemies that at the end of a few das the whole were exterminated This maj help us to explain why males of certain species of gall flies have never been discovered though a German entomologist has examined over two thousand females of one species and not a foreign element occurred in this nation of Amazons Mr Walsh has however discovered that in an American species of gall fly the spring brood consists of both sexes while the autumnal brood is composed exclu sively of females Again in some species of moths where the two sexes are of equal abundance Von Siebold found that it Avas no unusual thing for individuals to be hatched from eggs known to be laid by a previous virgin generation Fairly entered upon the duties of active life the young larva is capable of doing wonders in gastrodynamics It would seem with most insects as if all the eating for their lives were concentrated into this stage of their existence For there is a period coming of long cessation from activity when in external immobility and seeming lethargy wonder ful transformations pervade neive and muscular tissues a new body wonderfully differentiated for a new existence in a far more extended sphere than formerly is taking on its form beneath the rough and often unsightly pupa After the last moulting the power and desire of eating are lost increased stores of fat are laid up for the sustenance of the pupa and the wings and legs of the future fly are forming The worm seeks a shelter and often spins a cocoon of silk and there in quiet and away from the light its functious of animal life suspended and a very slow vegetative existence barely sustained as a chrysalis the insect spends a portion of its life The knowledge of the fact that all animals pass through some sort of a metamorphosis is very recent in physiology moreover the fact that these morphological eras in the life of an individual animal accord most unerringly with the grada tion of form in the type of which it is a member was the discovery of the eminent physiologist Von Baer Up to this time tlic true significance of the luxuriance and diver sity of larval forms had never seriously engaged the atteu tion of systematists in entomology What can possibly be the meaning of all this putting on and taking off of caterpillar habiliments or in other words the process of moulting with the frequent changes in orna mentation and the seeming fastidiousness and queer fancies and strange conceits of these young and giddy insects which seem hidden and mysterious to human observation We can only answer that tlie changes in form are neces sary stages in the growth of the animal and correlated with certain habits enabling it to hold its own in the struggle for existence We should appl our knowledge of the larval forms of insects to the details of their classification into families and genera constantly collating our knowledge of the immature forms with the structural variations that accompany them in the perfect state The simple form of the caterpillar seems to be a concentration of the characters of the perfect insect and presents easj characters by which to distinguish the minor groups and the relative rank of the higher divisions would seem to be definitely settled only when the form and method of transformations are thoroughly known The pupa state is the threshold upon which the young insect pauses before it enters upon the iinal stage of its ex istence Though called chrysalides because the pupae of cer tain butterflies are gaily ornamented with golden and sil very spots the most of them are dull and ugly Whether it is owing to their uninteresting appearance or the difficulty of finding them entomologists have very generally over looked the consideration of their forms and have underesti mated the value of the differences that the puiDe of different insects present There is in them more than in the cater pillar or perfected state a constant form by which we can readily recognize the family to which they belong and even in the slight modifications of that persistent facies together with the slight attempts at ornamentation which Nature seems always to be striving for in the rudest of her works the student whose mind is upon the watch for the meanings of these slight variations Avill be richly rewarded Just as insects have been classified by their larval characters which have ahvays agreed Avith those drawn from the imago can they again be arranged in a natural method by the sole con sideration of tlieir chrysalid characters When the insect breaks fortli from its clirsalis we can then see how wonderfully complex is the outer crust that gives form to the creature and protects its vital parts At first sight we see the body divided into three portions to which naturalists give the name of head thorax and abdo men terras borrowed from the anatomj of man himself and to be retained in science only until more appropriate names are suggested It is as if we should take a wormlike cylin drical figure consisting of successive rows of cylinders and should constrict it in two places thereby dividing the whole bod into three sections or regions Of these regions the first is the smallest and most unlike the two others in shape and besides organs of special sensation is provided with chewing organs while within is an enlarged pair of nerve knots serving as some sort of a brain though hardly larger than those snppl3ing the remainder of the body This re gion constitutes the head Larger than the head inasmuch as it is to support the organs of locomotion is the middle region or thorax which supports the legs and two pairs of wings while the largest portion of the body is the lulky abdomen which retains very much of the original wormlike form of tlio larva and is the seat of the reproductive system But weie the contour of tlie rings that make up these sections of the hard outer crust still continuous and unbroken we should have the poor victims enclosed in jackets of the straitest kind Whence comes theli all the grace and freedom of action that the but terfly and ichneumonfly possess It is in the fact that the whole outer crust is subdivided into portions finely hinged together by tough membranes and forming points of attach ment to thousands of little muscular fibres within thus giving it a surprising degree of flexibility Besides these pieces of which there is a definite number to each of the thirteen segments or rings that compose the body of every insect exclusive of the head which is supposed to consist theoretically of four segments we have to consider the numerous joints of the antennae of the mouth parts wliich consist of three pairs of appendages and of the legs We see therefore that descriptive entomology has to take account of several hundred distinct pieces which by changes in their relative size and position produce the immense range of vari ation in the half a million species which are found living or dead upon the earth Thus the idea of articulation upon which Cuvier founded this branch of the animal kingdom wiiich begins so simply in the worm and grows more complex in the crab and its allies in the insect is carried out with a richness and profusion of detail that is almost bewildering It is like comparing a boat dug out of a log to the Great Eastern or an Indians wigwam to the cathedral of Milan Our frontispiece conveys an idea of the metamorphosis of a butterfly a moth and a beetle The butterfly is the pretty Melitcea Phaeton which flies in June and July Its cater pillar feeds on the golden rod and when it transforms into the pretty white chrysalis fastens itself b the tail to the stem of the plant and hangs head downwards awaiting its final change into the butterfly The moth whose transformations are represented on the left of the plate is the Ctenucha Virginica It is a dark blue insect which flies in the hottest sunshine contrary to the habits of the majority of moths Its caterpillar which feeds on grass is like the Hairy Bear of our gardens and constructs under stones a jjretty cocoon of hairs which it plucks from its own body The water beetle is the common Gyrinus or whirligig beetle so commonly seen gyrating in small parties over the surface of our ponds Its singular larva is long and slender with long fringed breathing appendages along the sides of the body After all the insects interest us most when we study their psjcholog and habits From what little Ave know of their lS3chical endowments we see enough to convince us that as physicalh they occupy a middle ground between ourselves and the lowest and simplest of animals so in their instincts they seem to maintain a corresponding relation Tliey have what is the common property of all animals enough intelli gence to meet the exigencies of life They possess apparently like passions with ourselves so much so that we find our selves unconsciously judging of their actions by our own feelings Hence to our senses they hate and love show fear and revenge enjoy their moments of repose from toil engage in sports cany on wars live a hermit life or are gathered into commonwealths and are capable individually of some degree of education All this great diversity among insects in form and accom panying adaptation of instinct and reason are subservient to the part these animals are to play in natiuc There are no neutral noncom mittal characters among insects The agriculturist classifies them into two categories the friends and foes of his crops accord ing 13 Ihcy arc carnivorous cr herbivorous and it i necessary for him to di tinguish carefully between them This is often a diflicult matter for as we descend in the scale of animal life we find those broad lines of demarca tion which separate animals of different habits growing less distinct In some tribes which resemljle each otlier so closely that only educated eyes can distinguish them we have spe cies of totally different habits Thus the Hessian fly Fig 3 13 Fig 3 llcssiaa Ily a larva b pupa which swarms over our wheatfield might easily be mistaken by the farmer for what seems to him to be merely small or young mosquitoes so similar are the mature stages of the two though vhen a larva the one preys upon our crops and the other does service to mankind as a scavenger of our ponds and pools So also the bed bug which we can with safety pronounce to be essentially a bloodsucker has many allies which are innocuous sapsuckers Indeed our wonder is continually excited at finding insects of very similar form with habits of life most strikingly opposed Any account of the natural history of an insect would be very imperfect were the habits and description of the pecul iar parasites that check the increase and diffusion of the species left unrecorded All animals and many trees and llants are exposed to annoyance from the continued attacks of other species without having their actual existence en dangered but among insects the term parasitism has an other and extraordinary meaning since besides those minute forms of lowly organized life which only harass without inflicting more serious injur we have an immense number of insects high in the scale of organization which subsist upon other insects only to kill and destroy them utterl Thus of the ordinary parasitic plants and animals which always live on insects Dr Leidy has given us in his Flora and Fauna within Living Animals published in the Smith sonian Contributions to Knowledge some representations of remarkable delicacy and beauty of miniature forests of microscopic plants which line the alimentary canal of sev eral sorts of groundinhabiting insects There are not wanting here even divers sorts of low and exceedingly mi nute worms part of whose ofllce it may be is to restrain and keep within bounds the vegetation which luxuriates in those strange passage ways In the other form of parasitism the insect devours all the soft parts of the body of its victim leaving but the empty 14 crust ill its place Now there are two conditions to be ful filled in this act of parasitism for the insect preyed upon must maintain its hold upon life feeble as it may be long enough to enable the enemy lurking within to build up its tissues and add to its own strength by daily depleting from Fig 4 Ichneumon Muerocentrus the stores of vitalized food about it and on the other hand the parasite must carefully avoid touching the vital parts of its host It must content itself with feeding upon the fatty portions alone of the body That family of the Hymenoptera of which the ichneu monfly Fig 4 is a type and many species of true flies Fig 5 bearing a close resemblanco to the common house fly are devoted to this work of parasitismextraordinary The process is thus the parent fly lays its eggs within or upon the body of its victim most commonly a caterpillar which is fullgrown and about to enter upon its transforma tions The young worm hatches and feeds upon the large stores of fatty tissues which surround the vital organs of its host How very nice must be the adjustment of relations between the two animals when in the case of the parasite the slightest deviation from its path involving any injury to the neighboring nerves or vessels of its host will bring Fig 5 Tachina and larva eventual ruin to itself b hastening the death of the cater pillar This delicate balance between the growing parasite and wasting victim may continue through the chrjsalid state of both insects until just as we think the butterfly will break its prison walls lo the trim neat form of its unrelenting enemy steps forth from its body ready armed and equipped for active service The late Mr Ilerrick some years ago announced the dis covery of the fact that the eggs of the canker worm were preyed upon by a minute ichneumonfly Here is an anom aly an egg nourishing its inhabitant and immersed in the contents of another egg We have had the pleasure of watching the labors late in autumn of this little insect whose length measures not over three hundredths of an inch as it was busily engaged upon a bunch of eggs under our object glass Avith a restless anxiety to rid itself of its burden of infinitesimal eggs by pushing them through the walls of those upon which it stood Each egg developing perhaps simultaneousl we can imagine the race and struggle for ex istence in that tiny enclosure The germ of the larger worm rapidl collects and arranges the elements of its own form but it is in vain for the smaller being of a more rapid growth is stealthil and unawares as constantly pulling Fig 6 Antlion down that structure of cells and tissues The race is not always to the strong It often happens that several species of these parasites feed upon a single kind of caterpillar Thus upon the arm worm six species of ichneumons are known to exist and a Tachina fly is extremely destructive to it Baron Humboldt tells us in tlie Views of Nature that Bombyx Pini the Pine Spinner the most destructive of all the forest insects in Purope is infested according to Ratzeburg by no less than thirtyfive species of parasitical Ichneumonidaj AVe have incidentally alluded to the agency of carnivorous insects in diminishing the numbers of vegetable feeders The appellation of antlions Fig 6 antlion in its hole Fig 7 adult apliislions tiger beetles water tigers Fig 8 and dragonflies names borrowed from their fierce four footed namesakes are significant of the fierce passions and insatiable appetites of their sixfooted copyists We were one autumn reminded of the great value of having Fir 7 Antlion ailult a brood of martins or swallows about the farm and garden when a storm prostrated a martin box and one of its com jjQ g partments was found literally packed with the dried remains of the little yellow and black squash beetle The great and efficient aid of birds is too apparent to be passed over lightly We quote again from the Report of the French Commissioners upon this subject The commission excludes birds of prey such as magpies ravens etc with the exception of buzzards and rooks from the benefit of its pro tection because the buzzard consumes about six thousand mice yearly The Water Tiger rooks eat an incalculable amount of white worms Sparrows once thought harmful as eating grain are restored and their usefulness shown by reference to the fact that when their destruction was attempted in Hungary winged insects increased so rapidly that rewards for the destruction of sparrows were suppicssed and others given for bringing them back Frederick the Great ordered the destruction of sparrows because they ate his cherries but in two years time he found his cherries and all other fruits consumed by caterpillars In a sparrows nest on a terrace in the Rue Vivienne were found the remains of seven hundred cockchafers Owls and birds of that class which agricultural ignorance pursues as birds of ill omen ought to be welcomed They are ten times more useful than the best cats and not dangerous to the larder The martins that were killed were found to have in their stomachs the remains of five hundred and forty three insects The commission recommended a prohibition of birdnesting and the destruction of eggs or young birds We must not kill any birds even those that in the late summer pilfer from our orchards at other times eat multi tudes of worms It will not do to destroy the balance of nature The stud of insects has been too much confined to their classification and the synonymy of the species It is only occasionally that we see naturalists whose dispositions and opportunities lead them to study habits exclusivel or to combine the two departments of study DcGeer and Reau mur of the last centur whose ponderous tomes arc packed with observations of insect econom many of which have never since been repeated laid the foundation of these in quiries The labors of the Swedish Count and French nat nral philosopher are monuments of patient research and curious inquiry Here also should be noticed Ratzcburgs great work on forest insects In the elaborate and beautiful plates fifty seven in all that enrich the two volumes of this distin guished entomologist is reproduced the tree as it stands ia the forest gnarled and distorted by one set of insects its leaves curled and turned jellow or red by the attacks of others with certain branches stripped by still others and not only are certain trees and shrubs thus represented in colors but some of the plates represent parts of a forest showing the injury done in the mass by one or two species of insects with the changes in the form of branches and leaves for several years succeeding the defoliation and the after growth of branches depending on the different degrees of hijury with transverse sections of the twigs and micro scopic sections illustrating the pathological anatomy of the tree In England Cuitis Farm Insects and in our own country Harris Treatise on the Injurious Insects of Massa chusetts together with Fitchs reports on tho injurious in sects of New York and Walshs on those of Illinois Rileys on those of Missouri LeBarons on those of Illinois Trim bles work on the insects injurious to fruit trees and the reports of the writer on the insects of Massachusetts all elucidate the subject of applied or economic entomology Indeed the study of economical entomology is of growing importance Every passing year witnesses the attacks of new enemies of our crop that appear as the forests are cut down and their natural food plants destro3ed The wanton killing of insecteating birds also tends to a steady increase in the number of noxious insects More knowledge of en tomology should be diffused among agriculturists tliat they may be made acquainted with these pests and be forewarned against their attacks and thus save a fair percentage of their crops We begin in this number an account of the insects of the garden and as their name is legion we shall have to select a few of the most noxious and portray as clearly as possible their forms and briefly sketch their habits Were we to enumerate all the insect pests which gather about our flowers garden vegetables ornamental shrubs and fruit trees the list would extend to several hundreds A few of these such as the imported cabbage butterfly apple barklouse the vaporer moth the gooseberry sawfly and others are importations from Europe while the still more injurious canker worm tent caterpillar apple tree borer pear slug and more that could be mentioned are natives and before the apple and pear were introduced prob ibly fed on the species of wild cherr thorn and other rosaceous plants common in our woodlands In speaking of the great number of injurious insects which infest certain plants I may be pardoned for quoting as follows from my first Annual Report on the Injurious and Beneficial Insects made to the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture We should not forget that each fruit or shade tree gar den shrub or vegetable has a host of insects peculiar to it and which 3ear after year renew their attacks I could enu merate upwards of fifty species of insects which prey upon cereals and grasses and as mau which infest our field crops Some thirty well known species ravage our garden vegetables There are nearly fifty species which attack the grape vine and their number is rapidly increasing About scAcntyfive species make their annual onset upon the apple tree and nearly an equal number may be found upon the plum pear peach and cherry Among our shade trees over fifty species infest the oak twentyfive the elm seventyfive the walnut and over one hundred species of insects prey upon the pine Cut Worms Among those general pests which have no special foodplant and from their omnivorous tastes do infinite mischief in gardens are certain sl nocturnal crea tures the cut worms They have the well known habit of cutting off with their jaws the young succulent plants of the cabbage turnip bean tomato corn and various cultivated flowers These caterpillars are usually cylindrical the body taper ing slightly towards each end with a horny crescentshaped plate on the segment preceding the head They are usually livid greenish or ash gray with darker stripes along the body which is either smooth or slightly warty At rest they may be found curled up under sticks or stones in the grass or under boards etc left carelessly in he garden They transform within a rude earthen cocoon or chamber under the ground into a brown chrysalis which may often be found at the roots of corn grass etc The worm may be found late in spring and early in summer The parent moths fly late in summer and in September and while most of the family Noctuidaa fly only by night these Dart Moths as riQ 9 they are called from their rapid headlong flight may be seen in the hottest days about the flowers of the golden rod Our commonest species is the Gothic Dart Moth Agrotis subgothica Fig 9 The youBg of this modest moth is said by IVir liiley who has reared it to be an inch and a quarter long of a dirty white or ash gray with sometimes a yellowish tinge Along the back is a whitish line edged on each side with a dark one On the side are three lateral dark broader stripes the lower one the widest Another common but still larger Dart Moth is the Lance Bearer Agrotis suffusa of European authors or A telifera of Harris Fig 10 Mr Riley calls its caterpillar the Large Black Cut Worm It is an inch and a half long dull brown above with a distinct pale line on each side of the middle of the back Between these lines and the row Lance Bearer of breathing holes are two more pale lines There are eight black shining minute warts on each segment each wart bearing a short hair A third species of cut worm whose parent was called by Harris tlie Clandestine Moth Noctua clandestina is next to the Gothic Dart Moth our yj jq most common species and ma be found by day hiding under boards etc It flies only by night It is a blackish moth with obscure markings Its caterpillar is called b Riley the Wmarkcd Cut Worm It is an inch and an eighth long and is ash graj inclining on the back and upper sides to dirty yellow it is speckled all over with black and brown spots He adds that besides the usual lines on the side tho distinguishing feature is a row of black velvety marks along each side of the back on all but the thoracic segments i e the three succeeding the head bearing a general Fig 11 resemblance look ing from tail to head to the letter W These may be re garded as examles of the group of cut worms of which we have numerous forms All how ever seem to agree in the special mode of attack The cut young plants square off near the ground and then luxuriate on the soft pulpy centre of the stalk One species in the west Agrotis Cochrani Fig 11 ascends pear and apple trees and gvap vines eating off the fruit buds while another larva not of a true Agrotis however in New England cuts off the soft fresh shoots of the currant Mr Cochrane says that the western moth alwa3s prefers to lay her eggs near the hill or mound over the roots of the trees in the orchard and if as is many times the case the trees have a spring dressing of lime or ashes with the view of preventing the operations of the May Beetles this will be selected with unerring instinct by the miller thns giving her larvae a fine warm bed to cover themselves with during the day from the observation of their enemies It is probable that the females of all the Dart Moths deposit their eggs at the roots of grass stubble etc in the sum mer and early autumn and sometimes in the spring It is a weighty reason for burning all stubble or ploughing it under as deeply as possible that the eggs of many insects and indeed various insects themselves are thus destroyed Nearly all these moths frequent grass lands and rise from the ground on being disturbed fly off in their headlong course a few yards and drop down towards the roots of the grass According to Riley the eggs hatch out and the larvas acquire twothirds their size when winter overtakes them they then descend below the reach of the frost there re maining torpid until the warmth of spring calls them to the surface In a few species the winter is passed in the chrs alis state Cut worms hide by day under stones boards or sticks or in gardens burrow into the dirt to avoid the light and heat At dark they come up to the surface and usually according to Mr Coleman American Naturalist June 1873 appear regularl those that he watched coming up at nine oclock lie observed that the worm fed upon the grape in the follow ing manner The wormAvould come out of the ground at its usual timo ascend the vine till it came to a new shoot gnaw tliiit off and fasten itself to the stump of the branch so gnawed and suck the sap of the vine till it was so full that it seemed almost ready to burst then descend to the ground and bury itself out of sight It is well known that a roll of paper or tin surrounding the plant and its roots is the best preventive against the insidious attacks of the cut worm Mr Cochrane in deal ing with the Applebud Cut Worm sajs there is no known remedy salt has no properties repulsive to them they burrow in it equally as quick as in lime or ashes Tobacco soap and other diluted washes do not even pro voke them but a tin tube six inches in length opened on one side and closed around the base of the tree fitting close and entering at the lower end an inch into the earth is what the lawyers would term an effectual estoppel to fur ther proceedings The lest remedy is then to watch for the worms at dark or dig around the roots by day and kill by pressure under foot The next best remedy is to surround tlic plant with a roll of paper or pasteboard and avoid the use of nostrums recommended to kill he worm It is also a good plan to set Ijoards under wliich the worms are inclined to hide they should be examined every day and the worms if found killed Riley suggests that many cut worms may be entrapped by making smooth holes with a stick and examining tlieni the next day when the worms may possibly be found at the bottom The Mure Worm Another universal plague in gardens is tlie wire worm It is omnivorous in its tastes feeding on the roots of grain lawn grass various flowers and vegeta bles and in some cases attacking fruits and flowers They occur in all sorts of places but more abundantly tlian else where under the bark of trees and stumps where they feed on the deca3ing wood and thus are not harmful We have between one and two hundred species in this country The accompanying figure 12 taken from the Report of the En tomological Society of Ontario Canada for 1871 represents the larva and pupa of a common form Agriotes mancus which is very injurious to wheat The wire worm is readily known by its smooth slightly flattened cylindrical hard red dish body Mr Johnson Pettit who has made us fully ac quainted with the habits of the wheat wire worm says that it lives three years in the larval state He obtained a knowl edge of its habits by planting wheat in flower pots He found the grubs in the autumn with the first cold weather they ceased to eat and were then placed in a sheltered situa tion until the return of warm weather in the spring when they were restored to the breeding cages They soon gave evidence of being alive and possessing unimpaired appetites 1 Larva cnlargecl 1 little over three times n a transverse section 2 Un der side of the head and three succeeding

ftcr Horn their rapid consumption of the wheat plants rendered it nec essary to renew the supply quite as often a3 before They were fed in this way until the month of fiq 13 July On the 2Gth of August one of the grubs changed into a pupa and on the 3rd of September the first beetle appeared It is a pale reddish brown insect This insect and its allies are called click or snapping beetles from their power of throvving themselves up in the air in order to right themselves whenever placed by accident on their backs Figure 13 represents the grub and snapping Beetle and larva beetle of another wire worm which Fig 14 according to Mr Walsh lived in decaying wood in his breeding jar for a period of two years Figure 14 enlarged four times repre fig 15 sents a small slender wire worm found b Mr

Fig IG which has two largo luminous eclike spots on cacli side of the thorax and another at the base of the hind body beneath AYe have in New England even a phospliorescent wire worm Fig 17 Melanactes which sends out a dull greenisli light at night We cannot in speaking of remedies do better than quote from Mr Bethunes report Lime and ¦° T soot to be applied to the soil before sowing any grain are highly recommended by some but arc of doubtful efEcacy Salt on sandy soils is considered to be efficacious but not on heavier clay lands In a garden or small field they may be got rid of by strewing about slices of potato turnip or apple and examining the under sides every morning vhen numbers AVill usually be found feeding upon the bait Fig iG Moles are very useful in destrojdng them in meadows and a large number of our small birds devour them with avidity ducks turke3s and fowls will pick them up in ploughed fields and toads are not averse to making a meal upon them Our advice then is break up and fallow the infested wheatfields ploughing often and burning up the rub bish and encourage in every wa the farmers best friends the small birds Make it an absolute law of the household that not one of Fire Fly them is to be shot or stoned get your neighbors to do the same and believe us not many years will pass before you will find your insect plagues enor mously diminished The concluding remarks apply with much force in dealing with all our noxious insects The May Beetle Fig 18 larva pupa and beetle after Riley Our readers may recognize old acquaintances in the insects here figured The grub or white worm is abun dant in gardens lawns and grass lands and the parent beetle or Dorbug is the insect which so pertinaciously taps against our windows at night and if successful in effecting an entrance wheels its droning flight about the room to the terror and confusion of those within The grub is a large softbodied flesh Avliite worm as thick as the little finger about an inch and a half long with a honey yellowish or pale horncolored head Its skin is so thin and trans 28 Luminous Wire Worm parent that the air vessels and viscera can be seen through it and though it has three pairs of rather long legs it is so May Beetle ami young gross and unwieldy that it lies flat on its side when dug oit of its retreat in the soil In this state the grub lives three jears The series of changes the insect passes through in its whole existence is as follows in the months of May or June the yig 19 beetles pair and the females lay from forty to fifty eggs in loose dirt below the surface These eggs according to Mr Riley hatch in the course of a month and he adds that the grubs growing slowly do not attain full size till the early spring of the tliird year when they construct n ovoid chamber lined with a gela tinous fluid This fluid hardens we may add forming a glazed inner wall The chrysalis or pupa Fig 19 may be found in these cells about six inches under the surface in May and rarely in the autumn During the latter part of May and early in Juno iu New England namely for about a month the beetle flies about at night being most active in warm damp weather especially before thunder storms a period when most insects are restless By day our beetle in its sober garb of chestnutbrown hides in the foliage of trees especially the apple clinging to tlic under side of the leaves by its long curved claws which are admirably adapted for the purpose During winter the grub descends below the reach of frost and at the approach of warm spring weather wriggles up towards the surface The European Cockchafer has much the same habits as our Maychafer and when we say that in 18G6 the grubs of the Cockchafer destroyed in the department of the lower Seine over 5000000 worth of garden vegetables we fear we are prophesying a state of things that may ensue in America when our population becomes as densely crowded as in the old countries of Europe M Rciset see American Naturalist vol ii 209 says that this insect is three 3ears in arriving at its perfect beetle state The larva3 grubs hatched from eggs laid by the beetles which appcaicd in 18G5 passed a second winter that of 1867 at a mean depth in the soil of nearly a foot and a half The thermometer placed in the ground which was covered with snow at this mean depth never rose to the zero point or 32° Fahr of the Centigrade thermometer as minimum Thus the larvje survived after being perfectly frozen probably most subterranean larvce are thus frozen and thawed out in the spring In June 18G7 the grubs having become fullfed made their way upwards to a mean distance of about thirteen inches below the surface where in less than two months they all changed to the pupa state and in October and November the perfect beetle appeared The immature larvjB warned by the approaching cold began to migrate deep down in the soil in October vbon the tcmperaturG of the earth wis ten degrees above zero Centigrade as soon as the siov melted they gradu ally rose towards the surface The mischief done by the grub of the May beetle is at times almost incalculable In lawns and grass lands it cats the roots of grass Dr Harris in his well known Treatise sajs that in many places the turf may be turned up like a carpet in consequence of the destruction of the roots We have lately ascertained that it seriously damages strawberr plants being undoubtedly introduced in the manure It cats the main roots and so large and voracious is this worm that the roots of one plant must form a light meal for them and a dozen or so of the worms would be enough to ruin a small bed of strawberry plants It is obvious j oq then that if we observe a plant to wilt and suddenly die the white worm is at the roots It should be dug up and crushed be neath the foot It also eats in a still more summary manner 3oung squash plants when the have thrown out three or four leaves so that gardeners have been obliged to plant tlie seed over once or twice As to remedies against this grub the careful gardener will in the first jhice de Caiosoma caiidum stroy every grub turned up by the plough or spade When the top dressing is spread over the bed he would do well to examine it carefull for these conspicuous worms When a vine is seen to die down suddenly in summer he must then dig around the roots and search for the aggressor It is better to spend much time and money for two or three 3ears in suc cession in endeavoring to exterminate these grubs than to yield passively to the scourge It is Avell known that crows and small birds feed upon them in corn fields Skunks and moles are etncient aids in killing both grubs and beetles and the larger carnivorous beetles such as the Caiosoma Fig 20 devour the beetle itself In certain favorable 3ears the May beetle is fcarfull abundant It is then necessarj to resort to hand picking If the French take the pains to practise picking their chafers off the plants b hand so that in one instance about 80000000 were collected and de stroyed in a single portion of the department of the Lower Seine our gardeners can afford to take similar care The Goldsmith Beetle Fig 21 Of very similar habits is an ally of the May beetle the beautiful woolly yellow jj beetle which is as varied in its tastes as the May beetle The insect in the beetle state feeds on the young ten dor leaves of the pear elm hickoiy poplar oak sweet n guui and black berry while the Goldsnith Beetle and larva mischief to the roots of strawbeny plants The grub is white with a 3ellowish head and closeh resembles that of the May Beetle simply differing in having longer antennae and feet Rev Dr Lockwood has made us acquainted with the habits of this dcstructiAe chafer In the middle of June in New Jersey the beetle lays in the night about fourteen eggs in the soil each egg being deposited singly and at different depths In about a month i e the middle of July they hatch In other resjects its habits are much as in the May beetle In one instance tvro acres of plants were irrotriev abl ruined Dr Lockvrocd adds that the Goldsmith grub can be taken at any hour of the day simpl by scratch ing the earth from around the roots of those plants whose dark shrivelled leaves tell of the enemys presence The Seventeen Year Cicada Fig 22 a pupa b the same showing the rent in the back out of which the adult c creeps d hole made by the ovipositor for the eggs e after Rilej in its earl stages injures the roots of fruit trees by sucking the sap with its beak while the fly in its peri odical visits deserts the oak trees its natural food plant and invades our orchards causing by the deep stings of Seventeen Year Cicada eggs and piipa its large powerful ovipositor the 3oung twigs ¦ and small branches to wither and break off The most remarkable fact about this insect is that while so far as we know the other species of Cicada pass but two or three years in attaining the winged adult state the present one lives under ground over sixteen years assuming towards the end of the seventeenth the winged state AVe The European specics of Cicada live three years according to Ilaldcinan have seen that the May beetle is about three years in attain ing the beetle state and the wire worm and boring beetles such as the apple borer may be three or four years in the larval condition but no other insects are as yet known with this sole remarkable exception to be so long lived in their immature state The eggs of the Seventeen Year Cicada to the number of five hundred are laid in June and about the middle of Jul in the Middle States the grubs Fig 23 greatly enlarged are hatched They escape into the ground from the twigs on the trees and make their way to the smaller roots of the tree burrowing a foot or two below the surface When about to change to the winged state they ascend to the surface making cylindrical burrows firmly cemented and varnished so as to be water proof It should be here men tioned that certain broods T « r » A r i of this species appear once Larva of Seventten 1 ear Cicada ¦ in thirteen years and this indicates that the ancestors of the present species went through their round of existence in two years as in the other species How the wonderful divergence in habits was brought about would form an exceedingly interesting subject of inquiry We are indebted to Dr W I Burnett for an interesting suggestion concerning the chances of life in this insect and this may give us some hints regarding the enormous waste so to speak of life though after all it is an example of the economy of nature involved in the struggle for existence among animals Says our author in a paper read at a meet ing of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Albany 1851 The female has about five hundred eggs which from certain relations of the other sex which I have made out microscopically are probably all or nearly all fecundated We have then for every two individuals which have appeared this year a deposit of five hundred embryos for the generation to appear seventeen jcars hence Now from what has just been stated about the uniformity of their numbers each time it apixars that from the liabili ties of destruction during the long term of seventeen years out of these five hundred embryos only two appear certain of life and appearance iu their perfect state that is just re placing the two parents The chances of life therefore with this iusect are in round numbers two in five hundred This calculation may seem strange to some but if we reflect it can scarcely be otherwise for suppose the chances were double that is four in five hundred then we should have at each time just double the numbers of their last time which observation has shown to be untrue and which would augur much evil for the future condition of the vegetable world in the localities of their appearance Even if their chances were three in five hundred or half again the original stock agriculturists would quickly perceive the difference To sum up the matter then we have here an insect whose economy and conditions of life are so unique that it is almost entirely isolated from human destructive agencies and which is obliged to deposit five hundred chances for the certainty of securing two The ovaries have been formed with this capacity and the whole internal economy is of a correspond ing character The sluill noise made by the male Cicada for says Anacreon they all have voiceless wives originates in two kettledrumlike organs situated under the wings at the base of the hind body The Aphis Fig 24 We should not be doing justice to the subject of garden pests if we omitted a special notice of that Avonderful creature the Aphis or Ilant Louse Tl e first to appear in spring as the buds unfold the very last to desert their leafy homes in autumn iufesting every shrub tree and herb and not content to pre upon tlie leaves and bark but even attackino the roots of annuals and trees alike these little plagues are well nigh omnipresent The naturalist Bonnet as we have preiously intimated discovered in 1742 the singular mode of reproduction in these insects by which we are enabled to account for their enormous numbers He discovered that the summer brood of wingless individuals or larvie were born of virgin mothers that their progeny gave birth to similar aphides and so on through the summer for nine generations until the original maiden aphis counts her children and grand children by millions This large family thus launched into the world are abundantly able to provide for their own wants without the slightest anxiety to the maternal heart They at once on being ushered into the world plunge their long beaks into the leaf or twig on which they crowd and there remain through their lives leading a gluttonous existence indeed for when their stomachs are full they do not have to rest awhile and sharpen their appetites for the next meal or resort to emetics as in the palmy days of Roman epicurism but nature has provided them with two safety valves being two little tubes situated on the end of the body The liquid food or sap after passing through the alimentary canal in part overflows through these tubes as a sweet exudation called honey dew It may be seen drop ping on leaves and sometimes solidifies into a solid whitish sugar Aphides are thus a great source of attraction to ants and other insects which visit them for the sake of this honoy Frequently the ants will stroke them and urge them to give out their honey more rapidl hence they seem to milk them and the aphides are regarded as the ants cows Some utili tarian ants treat them as domestic cattle herding them and even carry this care of their flocks so far as to take them up in their jaws and carry tliem to a place of safety in their nests if clanger threatens The injury done by aphides is incalculable The Wheat Fig 25 aphis at certain seasons when extremely abundant by its punctures and the consequent loss of sap causes the crop to dimin ish the kernel being partly remphigus shrivelled and lessened in weiglt The leaves of

the grape vine that fearful scourge of the vine3ards of Europe and America Fortunately they have many enemies The maggot of the Syrphus Fly Fig 2G 2G a the fly Lady birds Fig 27 larva pupa and beetle prey upon them ver extensively and certain small ichneumon flies Aphidius as well as other insects ceitain mites such as the form here figured Tromhidium hidbipes Fig 28 and also some birds must diminish their numbers The Scale Insect Closely allied to the plant lice are the bark lice or scale insects on which we will dwell for a moment Imagine an animated 03ster shell or shallow basin walk ing about on six slen der legs and we have the young bark louse Let age effect its changes the insect becoming stationary the legs disappearing and its basinlike form glued to the bark of the tree and it be comes still more like an oyster shell fas tened to its native insect Male eulaiged rock Now compare with this bizarre form assumed b the female the winged active male and what a striking diflTercnce and yet both were exactly alike in the larval state What are the causes which have produced such a remarkable divergence between the two sexes They are for the most part mysteri ous and beyond our comprehension and yet by compaiing the scale insects with other members of the family to which they belong such as the mealy bug of our hothouses or Cochineal insect of tropical countries and the Aleurodes in which the sexual differences are less marked and then com paring them with the aphides on the one hand and on the other the Ps3lla a member of another family closely allied we are en abled to see that the changes »cpj inform have been undoubtedly induced by differences in habits the kind of surface to which the scales are attached the species i of tree to which they belong as well as to the different degree of mobility of the female for the more she is fixed and immov able the more active and lively is the male just as in St3dops Femaiestyiops b ecp ar asi te the female Fig 30 is remarkably different from the agile volant male Fig 31 We may see in the aphis where the two sexes are alike that in their 3 couitships the male finds its active partner in the ordinary move 1 ments of life while since the female scale V ¦¦ul insect is immovable xl Eirfi its winged partner needs to be far more restless and swift in its movements than 1 1 Male Stylops the male aphis so that its chances of encountering its mate in the course of its travels and thus providing for the continuance of the species are greatly iucroascd We know from personal ob servation that these male scale insects do travel far from the trees on which their partners occnr This leads us to regard this almost unnatural activit of the male scale insect as tending to prevent too close inandin breeding

male greatly enlarged after Riley the scale marked d is much wider than in the one marked c which lives on a narrower needle of the pine Indeed so great is the range of variation that when we regard the larvalike females it becomes difficult to draw the limits between the species Nearly every tree of the orchard and our hard Avood de ciduous trees harbor one or more kinds of scale insect The oyster shell scale insect of the apple tree is an unfailing at tendant and to young trees is extremely pernicious The orange trees of Florida have been at times grievously afflicted by another species while our ornamental shrubs and vines Fig 33 Parasite of Scale Insect and hothouse plants suffer greatly from their attacks The injury they do is the result of their vast numbers since they cluster on the leaves and stems of plants puncturing the skin or bark and sucking the sap flowing beneath Happily they have their parasites certain exceedingly small ichneumon flies such as CoccopJiagus and Aplielinus Fig 33 antcnnre c larva all greatly enlarged after LcBaron which prey upon them It is not rare to find a scale insect with a large round hole in the top of its bod through which the ichneumon has escaped Mites are also known to prey upon their eggs The Imported Currant Saio Fly This dreadful pest of currant and gooseberry bushes affords an excellent example of the mode in which an imported animal flourishes far beyond its natural limits when introduced into a new coun tf where its native insect parasites and bird enemies if such there be cannot reduce its numbers It was imported from Europe into nurseries at Rochester New York during the year ISGO It seems since that time to have spread westward and eastward arriving in eastern Massachusetts about 18G5 and since tlien has been very destructive in gardens in New England including the east ern part of Maine The parent of this worm is a saw fly so named from bear ing a sawlike sting or ovipositor with which it pierces the leaves or stalks of plants cutting a gash in which it deposits an egg the egg passing out from the ovarj through the oviduct and thence through the blades of the ovipositor into the wound made in the plant While most of the mem bers of this family cut a gash in the leaf into which an egg is pushed a few as in the present insect simply place them on the under surface of the leaf as seen in Fig 34 The fly has four wings and belongs to the group of insects Hymen optera that comprises the bee wasp and ichneumon fl The following account of its habits is taken from the writers Guide to the Study of Insects There are about fifty species of Nematus in this country of which the most injurious one the gooseberry saw fly has been brought from Europe Professor Winchell who has studied this insect in Ann Arbor Mich where it has been very destructive ob served the female on tlie IGth of June while depositing her cylindrical whitish and transparent eggs in regular rows along the under side of the veins of the leaves at the rate of about one in fortyfive seconds The embryo escapes from the egg in four days It feeds moults and burrows into the ground within a period of eiglit days It remains thirteen das in the ground being most of the time in the pupa state Avhile the fly lives nine da3s The first lrood of worms appeared May 21st the second brood June 2oth It Figure 34 i shows the eggs deposited along the under side of the midribs of the leaf 2 the holes bored by the very 3oung larvie and 3 those eaten by the larger worms Figure 35 a enlarged represents the worm when fully grown It is then cylindrical pale green with a pale green head while the segment next behind the head and the third segmcxit from the end of the body togetlier with the last or anal segment are yellow the sixteen false or abdominal legs are also ellow the six thoracic legs are horncolored The body is transversely wrinkled especially on the back and is slightly hairy The eyes and jaws man dibles are black and on the inner side of the edge reddish It is about threequarters of an inch in length Previous to the last moult however and before it has gained its full size preparatory to passing into the adult or winged condition the body is covered with black tubercles from each of which arises a stiff black hair There is also a supraanal or dorsal black patch on the last segment of the body from which arises a pair of black spines On the back of the false caterpillar the tubercles become smooth and trans versely oval and arranged in two regular rows Moreover a still more important characteristic of the worm in this state is the jetblack head which in the fully grown insect is pale peagreen In the region of Salem they may be found late in May or 12 Eggs of Imported Currant Saw Fly the first week in June feeding on the currants iiu 1 by th 8th of June they spin their cocoons which are of silk tough dense like parchment and at first green then becoming blackish and covered Avith particles of dirt and attached to the leaves in the breeding box Here they remain between two or three weeks in June the adult flies in Salem appearing June 2oth At nearly the same date June 29th the worms of the second brood were spinning their cocoons Larva of Imported Currant Saw Fly These cocoons belonging to the second rood remain under ground or on the leaves about the roots through the winter the flies appearing in the spring and laying their eggs as soon as the leaves unfold Not having specimens of both sexes of this saw fly at hnnd I coniile tie following description ften using their own words from Messrs AValsh and Rileys account in the American Entomologist Vol 2 p IG from which these illustrations Figs 36 a and 36 h are taken The female Fig 36 6 is a quarter of an inch long and is of a bright honeyjellow color The head is black with all the parts between and below the origin of the antennco except the tip of the mandibles jaws dull honeyycllov The antennae are brownblack often tinged with reddioli above except towards the base and beneath entirely dull reddish except the two basal joints They are fourfifths as Fig 3c long as the body the tliird joint wlien viewed side wise is four times as long as wide the third fourth and fifth joints are equal in length the remaining joints slowly diminishing in length On tlie thorax are four conspicuous black spots and other smaller ones The legs are bright honeyyellow the basal or hip joints coxjb and tro chanters whitish while the extreme tips of the hind shanks tibise and the Importca Currant Saw Fly whole of the hind toc joints tarsi are blackishbrown The wings are glossy with dark veins and expand a little over half an inch She is known in Europe to lay eggs which have not been fertil ized and from wliich young caterpillars are hatched as is sometimes the case with the silkworm and other moths as well as other kinds of insects including the honey bee The male Fig 36 a is rather smaller a fifth of an inch in length and is black The head is dull honcyyollow The antennjB are brownblack often a little reddish beneath except towards the base they are as long as the body and while longer than in the female are also somewhat flattened out The thorax has the wingscales and the prothorax or collar honeyyellow The under side and tip of the abdo men are honejyellow The injury done to currant and gooseberry bushes is very great They strip the bushes eating the leaves down to the leafstalk myriads clustering upon the branches The birds evidently do not feed upon them and thus in dealing with this insect we are deprived of one of the most powerful agencies in nature for restraining a superabundiince of insect life We can scarcely realize the amount of good done to the farmer and gardener by insectivorous birds As this is an important and practical subject let us digress for a moment to notice some facts brought out by Mr J J Weir a member of the London Entomological Society on the insects that seem distasteful to birds He finds by caging up birds whose food is of a mixed character purely insecteating birds could not be kept alive in confinement that all liair caterpillars were uniformly uneaten Such caterpillars are the yellow bears Arctia and Spilosoma the saltmarsh caterpillars Leticarctia acrjed the cater pillar of the vaporer moth Orgyia and the spring larva of butterflies with these may perhaps be classed the European currant saw fly He was disposed to consider that the flavor of these caterpillars is nauseous and not tliat the meclianieal troublesomeness of the hairs prevents their being eaten Larva which spin wels and are gregarious are eaten by birds but not Avith avidit they appear very much to dislike the web sticking to tlicir beaks and those com pletely concealed in tlie web are left unmolested WhcMi branches covered with the wel of Ijponomenta evonymcUa a little moth of the Tinea family Avere introduced into the aviarj those larvae only which ventured beyond the protection of the Aveb were eaten Smoothskinned gail colored caterpillars such as the Currant Abraxas or span worm which never conceal themselves but on the contrary appear to court observation were not touched by the birds He states on the other hand that all caterpillars whose habits are nocturnal and are dullcolored with fleshy bodies and smooth skins are eaten with the greatest avidit Every species of green caterpillar is also much relished All Geometras whose larvse resemble twigs as they stand out from the plant on their anal prologs are invariably eaten Mr A G Butler of London has also found that frogs and spiders will not eat the same larviB rejected by birds the frogs having an especial aversion to the currant span worms Abraxas and Halia The natural enemies of the Currant Saw Fly are three kinds of ichneumon flies of which one is a minute eggpara site Mr Lintner of New York states that of fifty eggs laid by the parent saw fly only four or five hatched out the currant worm VVe see then that though the birds appar rently destroy none an immense number are carried off even before they have a chance of doing any mischief by minute insects of their own order One of the best remedies next to picking them off by hand and which is really the most practicable method of getting rid of them is to dust powdered white hellebore over the bushes by sprinkling it from a muslin bag tied to a stick as it otherwise excites violent sneezing Used in this small quantity it is not poisonous This is the remedy used with most success in the west and recommended by Messrs Walsh and Riley A solution consisting of a pound of copperas to six gallons of water has been used with much success It blackens the leaves but does not injure them permanently Also suds made of carbolic soap is perhaps a better remedy Dr E Worcester of Waltham according to the Boston Journal of Chemistry finds that this worm may be fully and almost immediately destroyed by the use of carbolate of lime The doctor tried the powder in many instances during the jjast summer and found that while it was fully as effective as hellebore it was less disagreeable less costly and perfectly safe The method of using it is to sprinkle it over the bushes as coon as the worm makes its appearance bringing it well in contact with the leaves and soon the insect is dcstroed It will need but two or three applica tions and the work is done This worm attacks the gooseberry as well as the currant though in Massachusetts its ravages have been more confined to the latter shrub As a preventive measure against its farther spread in buying or transporting gooseberry and currant bushes Walsh recommends that the roots be care fully cleaned of dirt so that the cocoons may not be carried from one garden or nursery to another The Native Currant Sato Fly As this species maybe confounded with the European saw fly though belonging to Fig 37 Native Currant Saw Fly a different genus Pristiphora the following brief account of it is extracted from my Guide to the Study of Insects This saw fly Fig 37 a larva 6 female from the Amer ican Entomologist P grossidaricB of Walsh is a widely diffused species in the northern and western states and injures the currant and gooseberry The female fly is shin ing black while the head is dull yellow and the legs are 17 honeyyellow with the tips of the six tarsi and sometimes the extreme tips of tlie hinder tibije and of the tarsal joints pale dusky for a quarter of heir length The wings are partly hyaline with black veins a honeyyellow costa and a dusky stigma edged with honeyyellow The male differs a little in having black coxae Mr Walsh states that the larva is a pale grassgreen worm half an inch long with a black head which becomes green after the last moult but with a lateral brown stripe meeting with the opposite one on the top of the head where it is more or less confluent and a central brownblack spot on its face It appears the last of June and early in July and a second brood in August They spin their cocoons on the bushes on which they feed and the fly appears in two or three weeks the speciniens reared by him fl3ing on the 26th of August This worm may at once be distinguished from the imported currant worm by the absence of the minute black warts that cover the body of the latter The same remedies should be used against this worm as were recommended for the imported saw fly The Currant Sjictn Worm Fig 38 moth Fig 39 i 2 caterpillar 3 pupa Many persons in speaking of the Pio 38 currant worm confound the cater pillarlike saw fly larva with the wellknown geometer caterpillar which is a native species and was long since described by Dr Fitch under the name of Abraxas ribearia Wfc «iXrf As soon as the leaves of the cuirant Currant Span Worm Moth fjj expanded late in May or early in June the young caterpillars scarcely thicker than a horsehair may be found eating little holes in them In about three weeks after hatching it becomes fully grown it is about an inch long and bright yellow in color the body being covered with large blade dots The chrysalis is shining reddishbrown about half an inch long and may be found late in June either upon the ground or just under the surface In two weeks after entering the chrysalis state the moth may be obseived fl3ing about the garden or resting upon the leaves during cloudy weather The moth is yellow ochreous with dark often nearly transparent blotches on the wings Fig 39 Currant Span Worm and Pupa It is not easil mistaken for any other moth Mr Rilej in an article on this insect in the American Entomologist states that by sprinkling powdered hellebore upon the leaves or appljang a solution of eight or twelve ounces to a bucket ful of water the caterpillars will be killed Handpicking assiduously followed up and a vigorous shaking of the bushes over a sheet or newspaper repeated twice a day will keep this insect within moderate bounds The EiirGpean Cabbage Butterfiy It is interesting to compare tlic habits of the imported butterfly witli tliose of our native species TVe have two kinds of vvhitc Cabbage butterflies which have never done much harm to our cabbage and turnip crops The first of tliesc is the common white Northern Cabbage Butterfly Pieris oleracea of Harris Fig 40 a larva We have found the larvae of this species ou turnip leaves in the middle of August at Chamberlain farm in northern Maine Thc are of a dull green and covered with dense hairs When about to transform they suspend themselves by the tail and a transverse loop and their chrysalides are angular at the sides and pointed at both ends Harris The butterfly is white with the wings dusky next the body the tips of the fore wings are yellowish be neath and the hind wings are strawcolored beneath The yellowish pear shaped longitudinally Native Cabbage Euttcifli i ii i ° ribbed eggs are laid three or four on a single leaf In a week or ten days the larvae are hatched They live three weeks before becoming full fed The chrysalis state lasts from ten to twelve days There is an early summer May brood and a late summer July brood of butterflies While this kind feeds on the leaves of the cabbage and turnip the Southern Cabbage Butterfly Pieris Protodice when in the caterpillar state feeds on the outer leaves of the cabbage plant It is often destructive in market gardens in the middle and southern states But the injury done by our aboriginal butterflies is slight indeed compared with that resulting from the European species which is usually unchecked by its ichneumon parasites or by birds which are preserved iu Europe where with us they are either brutally murdered or neglected if allowed to Jive The European Cabbage butterfly Pleris rapce Schrank is however a hundred fold more formidable insect as it is fearfully abundant where it occurs and the caterpillar feeds inside of the cabbage head when forming It was introduced from Europe to Quebec about the year 1857 having been captured in 1859 by Mr Bowles of that city It rapidly spread into New England along the differ ent railroads leading in from Canada and is now common about Boston and New Yorlc and has reached Washington About Quebec it annually destroys 250000 worth of cab bages according to the Abbe Provancher It is evident that in this newly arrived insect we have another formidable pest added to our list of imported insects The male butterfly Fig 41 is white with the tips of the fore wings black dusted with white while on the fore wings is a single and in the female Fig 42 there are two large black spots situated twothirds of the distance from the base to the outer edge of the wing It expands about two inches The female lays her eggs singly on the under side of the leaves The caterpillar Fig 43 a is green and so densely clothed wdth minute hairs as to be velvety it has a yellowisli stripe down the back and another along each side the belly being of a paler brighter green it is often more than an incli long and about as thick as a large crowquill It changes in September under some board or stone to a chrysalis suspended by a thread spun over the back as rhown at Fig 43 b It is of a pale fleshbrown colcr freckled witli black It does not appear to have been very destructive in Europe but like other introduced species it suddenly becomes a fearful scourge The best remedies arc eidently handpicking when the caterpillars can be seen iind the capture of the butterflies by means of a light gauze net mounted on a wire ring a foot in diameter and attached to a short pole Affected cabbage heads should be carefully examined and if mvich infested by worms be burnt for if they are suffered to lie about the garden after being pulled up the caterpillars will attack the other plants A correspondent of the American Agriculturist for November 1S70 states that it is estimated that the loss from this insect will in the vicinity of New York cit Fig 41 Tig 43 Imported Cabbage Butterfly male Fig 42 Imported Cabbage Butterfly female Caterpillar and Chrysilis alone exceed half a million of dollars and already the price of cabbages has advanced He says that Mr Quinn the owner of a large plantation has found carbolic powder superphosphate and lime together to destroy them The carbolic powder appears to be sawdust impregnated with car bolic acid Salt has been recommended but Mr Quinn did not find dry salt efficacious though lime has been reported by others as useful Mr C S Miuot in an interesting article entitled Cab bage Butterflies in the American Entomologist vol 2 strongh recommends destroying the chrysalis which may be found under chips boards stones etc and advises that boards raised two inches above the surface of the ground be placed among the plants to attract the caterpillars when about to change to a chrysalis Mr Curtis has described and figured several parasites of the three species of cabbage butterflies found in England and he shows how thoroughlj they keep in check these trou blesome worms Certain minute ichneumon flies Chalcids lay their eggs in those of the butterflies Another Chalcid fly Pteromalus brassicce lays its eggs on the outside of the chrysalis of the White Cabbage Butterfly Pieris brassicce and sometimes two or three hundred of the little Chalcid maggots have been found living riotously within a single chrysalis They turn into minute brilliant flics which mul tiply in excessive quantities Mr Curtis remarks that some species of this extensive genus PieromaZws prob ably comprising nearly one thousand species swarm even in our houses especiady in the country where in October and November I have seen immense numbers inside of the windows and I believe that they hibernate behind the shut ters in the curtains etc Fortunatelj for the prospects of American gardeners we have a parasite Fig 44 a male 6 female c larva d pupa which already carries off large numbers of the caterpillar Lately in the middle of September Mr F W Putnam handed me one hundred and ten chrysalides of the butterfl all lut two of which wore infested by these parasites in both the larval and pupa states while from other chrysalides the adult Chalcid flies were emerging They continued to emerge until late in the autumn The infested chrysalides of tlie butterfly could le easily distinguished by the livid and otherwise discolored and diseased appearance of the body while those unattacked had preserved their fresh color and the tail moved about readily the diseased ones becoming stiff and more or less dried Mr Putnam thinks that at least twothirds of the chrysalides of this butterfl3 hundreds of which had in the early autumn suspended themselves about his house and fences had been attacked by these useful allies On opening the bod of the infested chrysalides I found about thirty parasites in different stages of growth in one case thirtytwo in another only twelve We can readily see Fig 44 Parasite of Cabbage Butterfly how efficient these minute insects become in reducing the numbers of their hosts A large proportion of the Ptero mali undoubtedly winter over in the body of the chrysalis the adult insects appearing in the spring In England Mr Curtis found the fly in June so that evidently there is an autumn and spring brood of Chalcid flies The male of this Pteroraalus is a beautiful palegreen fly with the body finely punctured and emitting metallic tints the abdomen or hind body is flat in dried specimens with a deep crease along the middle of the upper side and it is much lighter in color and Avith more decided metallic reflections than on the rest of the body The antennte are honeyyellow Avith narrow black wings The legs are pale honey yellow It is from onetwelfth to onetenth of an inch in length The body of the female which would be thought at first to be an entirely different kind of insect is much stouter broader with a broader oval abdomen ending in a very short ovipositor while the underside of the body near the base has a large conical projection It is much duller green than the male and the body is more coarsel punctured The scu tellum of the metathorax is regularly convex not keeled in both sexes The antennas are brown and the legs brown becoming pale towards the ends the ends of the femora thighs being pale the tibij£ are palebrown in the middle much paler at each end while the tarsi aie whitish though the tip of the last joint is dark It is from a line to a line and a third in length It differs from Harris Fteromalus vanessce in the little piece known as the scutellum of the metathorax being smooth not keeled and by its darker legs The larva is a little white maggot about a sixth 17 of an inch in length The body consists of thirteen segments exclusive of the head and is cylindrical tapering rapidly towards the head while the end of the body is acutely pointed The chrysalis is whitish the limbs being folded along the under side of the bod the antenntu reaching to the end of the wings the second pair of legs reaching half way between the end of the wings and end of abdomen while the tips of the third pair of feet reach halfway between the second pair of feet and the eud of the abdomen It is from a line to a line and a third in length This invaluable ally of the gardener is one of the chalcid family of Iljmenoptera and was long ago described by Linnajus under the name of Itcromalus imparum from tlie fact that it inhabited the pupae or chrysalides of butterflies This insect has been known to inhabit this country since 1844 as there are sjiecimens in tlie Britisli Museum taken in Hudsons Bay Territory in that jear so that it is probably indigenous to both countries while its present host in North America is the imported cabbage butterfly introduced in 1857 I have found that another parasite attacks this insect as the larva of a species of Tachina Fig 45 occurred n the body of a caterpillar Doubtless others Avill eventually be found to take up their abode in the body of this insect It would be interesting to learn whether the birds prey upon the butterfly or caterpillar and whether they assist in reduc ing the number of these pests We can but hope that the present enormous numbers of these worms will as soon as the insect becomes fully domesticated be held in check by the united efforts of gardeners and the natural ene mies of the insect As the worm eats the interior of the cabbage or cauliflower it is difficult to deal with Some Tachina larva thing can be done by showering the heads with a solution of carbolic acid or strong soap suds but it is better to employ hand picking and when the plants are hopelessly infested to throw them on a hot fire If fed to animals the worms will manage somehow to escape The Cabbage Webmotli Another destructive insect which is almost cosmopolitan in its distribution is a little green caterpillar which at times so abounds on the outer leaves as to threaten the destruction of whole fields of cabbages It is most abundant in a warm and unusually dry season Dr Fitch was the first to observe it in Illinois during the year 1855 He named it Cerostoma brassicella but it is un doubtedly the well known European Plutella xylostella and first described by Linnaeus Though the insect has been observed in this country only late in the summer and in Sep tember when the cabbages have headed yet these worms as Dr Fitch suggests probably belong to a second brood Mr H T Stainton in his excellent Manual of British But terflies and Moths states that the moths fly in May and August while the caterpillars appear in June July and a second brood again in September Dr Fitch suspects that the first brood of caterpillars maj feed on the5oung cabbage plants in early summer and thus do more mischief than in the autumn when the heads are fully formed The caterpillar is a little pale green worm with small stiff dark hairs scattered over the body it is a quarter of an inch long When about to transform it spins a beautiful open network of white silken threads forming a cocoon Fig 46 open one at end it is a third of an inch long The moth itself Fig 4G a is pale gray with the head palpi and antenna white but the lat ter are ringed alternately with 1 1 1 Cabbage Webmoth and cocoon white and gray on the outer half The rest of the body is gray except on the under side and on the middle of the thorax where there is a broad white longitudinal band which when the wings are folded is continuous with the white band along the inner side of the wings The two front pair of legs are gray with the tarsal joints ringed narrowly with white the hind legs are whitish and hairy The fore wings are gray with a conspicuous broad longitudinal white band along the inner edge and extending to the outer third of the wing this band sends out three teeth towards the middle of the wing the third tooth being at the end of the band There is a row of dark dots Tlii8 and flsnre 41 arc from my Report on the Injurious Insects of Massachufctts anil are kindly loaned by Mr C L Flint Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture along the outer edge of the stripe a row of blackish dots along a pale shade just outside of the front edge of the wing and two rows of blackish dots diverging upon the tip or apex of the wing The fringe is marked with a few dark spots The middle of the wing next the white band is darker than the front edge while a faint jcllowish shade runs along the middle of the outer half of the wing towards the tip enclos ing a few black dots It expands a little over half an inch Should 3oung plants be attacked by the worms the best remedy would be to shower them with soapsuds For the autumnal brood of worms the plants should be plentifully showered and if this is not efficacious the worms should be picked off by hand the cocoons especially The Garden Leaf Roller One of the most intelligent and industrious of our garden pests is the leafrolling cater pillar which as soon as the leaves unfold in the spring begins to draw them together in an ingenious manner by silken threads in order to make a rude sort of domicile where it may live hidden from the sharp ejes of its featliered and insect enemies By the first of June its presence in the terminal shoots of the apple the rose and other shrubs together with the strawberry may be detected by the crum pled and distorted mass of leaves at the end of the shoot or if the strawberry plant by the leaves being sewed together in a tangled head How is the following problem in mechanics to be solved How does the tiny worm pull the leaves together and sew them into a rude sort of tube or tent The little creature begins by spinning a thread and attaching one end to some fixed point and then attaching the other to tiie loose leaf By means of the powerful muscular movements of the front part of the body and like a sailor except that our caterpil lar uses its teeth it is doubtful if the fore legs assist in the operation it hauls away on the rope of silk slowly pulling it up to the desired point where it is held in place by a new an 1 shorter thread Finally after much labor the joung caterpillar for it begins its work soon after hatching from the egg spins a number of threads each of which adds new strength to the tubular structure until a tent arises the whole the work of perhaps but a few minutes In this tent it resides enlarging it as its body grows and eating out the interior adding new stores of food by sewing new leaves to the outside of the tent until when about to pass into the chrysalis state it stops eating It does not now desert its home Its tent serves it as a rude cocoon the caterpillar having previously lined it with silk and we often find the end of the chrysalis protruding out of the door of the tent after the moth has flown away p This species of leafroller called Lozotcenia rosa ceana by Dr Harris Fig 47 enlarged twice is rather large compared with others of its family its body rather plump and pale livid green its head is black as is also the ring following while the other segments are transversely wrinkled above with a few scattered fine hairs The moth itself usually appears about the last of June From its eggs laid at this time a new brood of worms appear in August The af pupa or chrysalis is pointed on the top of the head and on the hinder edge of each abdominal ring are two rows of spines The moth is pale brown with two broad oblique darker reddish brown bands across the fore wings and a tri angular spot of the same color near the tip The hind wings are ochreous yellow The wings expand abont an inch and the caterpillar is a little less than an inch long There are many other leafrolling caterpillars Avhich roll up leaves much more perfectly than the Garden Leafroller No one has described their mode of building their tubular houses letter than the celebrated French philosopher and naturalist Reaumur VVe may find on some of our trees leaves rolled up much like those here figured from Reau murs work entitled ¦¦Memoires pour servir a VHistoire Natii relle des Insects and which are copied from Figuiers work The Insect World Figure 48 represents an oak leaf which has been partially Fig 48 Fig 49 Oak leaf rolled perpendicularly and sidewise rolled np transversel We can see with what care the leaf has been rolled up and how at each step the roll has been secured by bundles of silken strands A similar roll is seen Fig 50 Sorrel leaf cut by a caterpillar at figure 49 where the leaf has been rolled sidewise or lon gitudinally to the leaf with the same painstaking Another species Reaumur found to roll a portion of a sorrel leaf cut ting it away from the side of the leaf and then deftly rolling it up into a slender cone which stands up nearly on its base Fig 51 Fig 52 Willow leavcs rolled by a caterpillar and section Fig 50 An example of a less perfect roll and one inter mediate in perfection between the foregoing nests and the tent of the common garden Tortrix is shown in the accom panying figure 51 of a number of willow leaves rolled up by a caterpillar wliile figure 52 gives a transverse section of the same compound roll with the outer threads binding the simple rolls into a bundle Our garden leafroller can be best subdued by hand picking It is easy to detect the tents and a simple matter to remove the worm arid crush it under foot The Leaf Cutter Bee The leaves of the rose bushes in the garden are sometimes strangely cut into as if some fairy had overnight deftly cut them with her wanton scissors To Fig 53 The Leaf Cutter Bee and nest many this fact is a sore puzzle It is due to a leafroller of quite a different sort from any we have before considered The figure 53 after Figuier represents the Loaf Cutter Bee cutting out a circular piece of leaf with her scissorslike jaws while the nest composed of numerous pieces variously folded and pressed together attests her wonderful skill and forethought IN continuing these halfhour talks about insects some remarks upon the more direct relations of these little beings to human interests may not be inappropriate We may from our moral and intellectual heights look down upon the lower world of insects as did the gods and demi gods of old frona Olympus upon their halfbrothers and cousinsgerman on the plains below For physically are we not related to the insects Remotely it is true but still wc have perhaps branched off from a common stock the starting point some monad Our blood differs in qual ity and not in kind our muscles are but repetitions in structure of the flesh of insects and finall an insect at the outset is but a drop of oil and albumen or proto plasm and from what else does man originate Allied as he is also to the beasts and lower animals in being at times under the control of fierce passions and animal propensities while morally and intellectually the noblest work of the Creator one effect of the recent advances in the science of man which indicate that his animal origin is a matter of strong probability will be to draw out his interest in the humbler creatures to lead him to deal with them more sym pathetically to love his domesticated animals more wisely and truly while he may not the less by worship of his Cre ator and work for humanity strengthen the diviner impulses of his nature lie priyeth well who lovcth well Both niaa and bird and beast Every true naturalist is an exofficio member of the Society for the rrevcntion of Cruelty to Animals He will not lcat his horse or dog any more than his own children Rather will he endeavor to train them by the power of kindness than by the force of blows So in the dealings of civilized with savage man the legiti mate results of a proper study of anthropology or the science of man while teaching us that there are different grades of intellect and moral sense in tlie different races of man as in the members of our own families where each may re quire a different mode of education though all are eiually loved by their parents will lead us to observe the primary law of international behavior the law of love Each may require a different mode of treatment while all must be re garded as men and brothers Though one race under a favoring heaven and superior mental organization stands superior to another yet if many naturalists are right all have had a common monkey origin and the European or American of today need not despise his Bushman or Australian brother who is perhaps but a few removes nearer his simian ancestors than himself So all the animal creation is of a piece part and parcel of one grand Divine plan Some philosophers and theologians even ascribe immortality to the animals and believe that in the hereafter we shall hear the song of the mosquito the hum of the bee and the shrill rolling drumbeat of the ci cada Insects are related to us in a thousand ways and some how either by themselves or through their products they are more than we should at first imagine constantly in our daily thoughts Beau Brummels cravat which historians tell us absorbed no small proportion of his thoughts in his waking moments was spun by a silkworm A spiders web tradi tion says saved King Robert Bruce in his sleep Thou sands of peole in the P2ast are dependent for life on locusts and wild honey Is the potato beetle an unimportant per sonage in the west And in the south are not hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cotton annually devoured by the arm worm In the New England states is not the face of nature almost transformed by the ravages of the canker worm How life to many would be glorified and this world seem a brighter one if the flea the louse and the bedbug were removed from its surface How much difference would it make to the world of insects were man to be llotted out of existence We imagine the insects would look with as much indifference upon his re moval as we in turn regard the demise of a mosquito Have not through the ages past from the time when the first grasshopper chirped upon a tree ferns leaf in the Devonian forests of New Brunswick millions of species of insects had their day and died with no human being to witness them Imagine the eons and eons of measured eternity through Avhich by day and night the busy hum of insect life has risen and fallen with no human ear to listen But on the other hand blot out those busy servants of ours the bees the mjri ads of insects that aid in fertilizing our vegetables and fruit trees the silkworm whose products form so large an item in the commercial greatness of the East and of Southern Europe the lac and dye insects those that produce galls for making ink the myriads of grubs and flies that act as scavengers and purify the air saving us from pestilence all working so quietly and effectively that few appreciate how much we owe to them blot out all of these and the world would be a poor home for its owner man He would be forced then if never before to appreciate the place of man in creation and would be taught that as an animal his life touches at many points the lives and interests of the humlle creatures about him We naturall divide insects into friends and foes but our senses are still quite uninstructed in distinguishing them and few but the trained entomologist can go into the field or garden and mark this insect as a true friend and that so much like the other that ordinary e3es cannot distinguish them apart as an enemy of our comfort or crops Moreover there are Insects which are friendly in but a Piclv wickian sense There are certain parasitic insects that sticlv to us closer than a brother and yet with the moral qualities of fiends Man is a sort of treasury or bank to these crea tures and they are happily few in number who draw upon him not only at sight but who go it blind And when through carelessness or idleness the bank is too attrac tive and liberal in its discounts the audacious vermin congre gate in teeming hosts and make a run upon it Parasitic insects seem in many cases to be actually blind through ava rice as amaurosis is not an uncommon affection Fig 54 among articulated parasites It would seem as if the gods struck blind all such beings for their greed in sucking our blood There is the louse Fig 54 the most intimate of these friends forsooth of ours Ugly and repulsive in itself it is tenfold more so in its associations Though its legs are well devel oped the beak wonderfully adapted for its use vet it lives in a Stygian twilight its eyes re Louse duced to a simple pomt a little depression on the side of its head forming but a single isolated facet the simplest kind of eye when there are 25088 such facets in the eye of a certain small beetle Mordella and 4000 in that of the house fly whose head is all eyes If we look at the beak of the louse Fig 55 we shall at once perceive that the creature does not bite but that it in reality sucks onr blood so the mosquito introduces its bladelike jaws and sucks our blood It is incorrect to say that a mosquito bites Those organs that in allied insects are jaws in the lice lose their biting function and are converted into a fleshy extensible tube the true jaws forming ribbonlike bands strengthening the tube When looking about for a weak place in the skin of his host the creature alights upon a sweat pore Into this he plunges his sucker and anchors it there iig 5 by a number of hooks Fig 55 ee After they have firmly grasped the surrounding flesh the first pair of bris tles the real mandibles transformed are protruded we are quoting Prof Schiodte here almost word for word as given in the American Naturalist vol iv p 86 These bristles are towards their points united by a mem brane so as to form a closed tube AVhen the whole instrument is exserted we perceive a long membranous flex ible tube the portion from ef and including the end hanging down from the under lip labium and along the walls of this tube the bristlelike jaws in the form of narrow bands of chitine In this way says Schiodte the suck ing tube can be made longer or shorter as required and easil adjusted to the thickness of the skin in the particular place where the animal is sucking whereby access to the capillary system is secured at any part of the body It is apparent from the whole struc ture of the instrument that it is by no means calculated for being used as a sting but is rather to be compared to a delicate elastic probe in the use of which the terminal lobes probably serve as feelers As soon as the capillary system is reached the blood will at once ascend into the narrow tube after 5 MouUi of a Louse which the current is continued with increasing rapidity by means of the pulsation of tlie pumping ventricle and the powerful peristaltic movement of the digestive tube Fig 55 shows this tube and adjacent parts of the head magnified one hundred and sixty times aa the end of the head bb the chitinous band and c the base of the under lip d the under lip protruded with the hooks ee and the sucking tube with a few blood disks passing through it How a louse breathes is perhaps as practical a question as how it bites All insects inliale air through a row of holes stigmata in the side of the body which connect by a series of tubes tracheae within ramifying throughout the body no air is taken in through the mouth Now grease and oil when in contact with the sides of the body tend to close up these breathing holes and then the creature suffo cates Thus oil or pomatum is an antidote A woid to the wise is sufficient Not only personally but also indirectly through those kinds which swarm on his domestic fowls and quadrupeds is man affected by these creatures Those species which live for the most part on birds have true jaws enabling them to nibble and thus irritate the skin of their host While we are upon this harassing theme we should not pass over that kindred subject the bedbug This insect with a body so flat that an ordinary punch with the thumb only seems to tickle it seems preordained for a life in cracks and crannies First noticed in literature by Aristotle it was also mentioned by Dioscorides and Pliny It was first met with in Germany in the eleventh or twelfth century and was mentioned as an English insect by Mouffct in 1503 It is possible that its original haunt was the nests of doves and swallows and the most effective way should it seem desirable to ensure an abundant harvest of these pests is to keep a number of these birds about our houses Whether it actually lives under the feathers of doves or not could be easily ascertained If so tlien they are as truly bird para sites as the lice to which they are especially Avhen young not remotely allied in form and structure That they or a closely allied species sometimes swarm in the nests of swallows we have been informed by a gentleman in Iowa who found a nest of swallows as stated in the Guide to the Study of Insects on the outside of a court house which swarmed with bedbugs and they were not conGned to the nest but flocked in the apartments frequently serving well pointed bills of ejectment against the legal gentlemen within They continued to trouble the occupants year after jcar until the stream of hemipterous life was traced to its fountain head the swallows nests The opinion that the bedbug originally lived under the feathers of house haunting semidomestic birds is strengthened by the fact that a European species of Cimex lives on the body of the swallow another on the bat while a third is found in pigeon houses and is named from that fact the Cimex of dove cotes Cimex columbarius We have in this country a flat bodied red bug closely allied to the true bedbug but its habits are quite unknown We need not tell harrowing tales of the disgusting habits of this scourge for are there not fresh experiences in the minds of those who travel most in the more unsettled portions of our country as well as the other parts of the globe A word or two on some less known traits of this creature may give some useful hints in dealing with it The parent lays white oval eggs and when tlie young bug is fully formed within it escapes by pushing off the end like a lid as one pushes up a trap door The young are at first whitish and transparent the stomach being visible usually red from being filled with blood and at this time it bears a striking resem blance to a louse Westwood sa3s that it is eleven weeks in attaining its full size The adult is hard lived in a double sense its tenacity of life is only equalled by its viciousness The Swedish Count Degeer ia his classic Memoires pub lished a century ago says that he kept full sized individ uals in a sealed bottle for more than a year Avithout food Dr Landois has recently ascertained how these insects are enabled to fast so long He observed that as in the flea and louse the blood drawn in from their victims collecting in the small intestine loses its cells and forms a blackish mass which remains for months unaltered Thus after the bug has fully gorged itself it has Avithin its small intes tine a reservoir on which it may live a long time But happily though few may be aware of it the bedbug has a natural enemy the cockroach whose mission it Fig 56 Fig 57 Keduvius pupa and young seems to be to keep this and other insects in check What then if the cockroach nibbles our towels and clothes occa sionally when driven through stress of hunger The cock roach is particularly valuable on shipboard by reason of its insectivorous habits The Eeduvius Fig 56 pupa is also said to prey upon the bedbug Degeer tells us that the wingless young Fig 57 have the instinct to en velop themselves in a thick coating of particles of dust and so completely adds Westwood do they exercise this habit that a specimen shut up by M Brulle and which had undergone one of its moultings during its imprisonment divested its old skin of its coat of dust in order to recover itself therewith Does the bedbug poison us when it bites So we may ask whether the flea mosquito and black fly convey a drop of poison into the punctured wound they make This is a disputed point Dr Landois however the latest writer on this subject thinks that when the creature is sucking a part of the salivary fluid can easily pass into the wound and it is not unlikely that the red stains that we often see appearing after a sting on the hands of sensitive persons originate from the saliva which flows into the wound and acts as a poison Other hemipterous insects he adds are dreaded on account of their sting ¦Cimex nemorum accord ing to Kirby stings as powerfully as a wasp and Notonecta glauca stings with a burning sensation St Pierre found in the Mauritius bugs whose sting was as poisonous as that of a scorpion giving rise to swellings the size of a doves egg and which lasted for five days Another sort of bug is sometimes according to Mr Riley found in beds in the western states It is the Conorhhius sanguisuga It is much larger than the common bedbug and its bite is much more painful It belongs to quite a different group of hemipterous insects and is allied to the Reduvius of wliich we have spoken Passing by the flea and the itch mites which end the list of human parasites and whose habits and appearance are so well known we will dwell fur a few moments on the poison ous insects which trouble man The ioison of all insects judging from the chemical comiosition of that of a few kinds which has been analyzed is alkaline in its nature and has for its main ingredient formic acid a substance peculiar to the secretions of insects The sting of the bee is simply a modified form of the ovi positor of the ichneumon fly Fig 58 from Ilguier and the saw of the saw fly It is composed of three pairs of slender blades the innermost forming the sting proper being barbed at the end so that when darted into the flesh of its victim it often remains and the bee stings but once The poison gland or bag empties into the sting the poison ous fluid being forced by the pressure of the walls of the body upon the sac there being apparently no special muscles Ichneiinioa Fly adapted for the purpose The sting of the wasp is like that of the bee The celebrated Reaumur as quoted by M Tandon thus discourses on the effect of the sting of wasps on himself and his servant Being stung by a wasp I thought I might gain something from his infliction by bear ing it with a good grace I allowed the animal to wound me at his leisure when he had withdrawn his sting of his own accord I irritated and jjlaced him on the hand of a domestic who Avas not expecting to be stung but the wound did not cause him much pain I then made the wasp sting me a second time when I scarcely felt it The poisonous fluid was nearly exhausted by the former experiments and I could not induce the wasp to make a fourth wound This experiment and others which people will probably not care to repeat have taught me that where the animals are undis turbed the sting is never left in the wound The sting is flexible and is not driven straight in but forms a curved or zigzag wound If the insect is compelled to withdraw it suddenly the friction is sufficient to retain the sting which is somewhat hooked and tears it off On the other hand if the animal is not disturbed it withdraws the sting grad ually There is quite a difference in the poisonous qualities of different kinds of bees as well as wasps and in the size and strength of the sting We have been used to catching wild bees and wasps without being stung by firmly grasping the hind body or abdomen with our fingers rendering the sting powerless How useful the sting is to bees is shown in the honey bee which uses it as a weapon of offence as well as defence in stinging the caterpillars of the bee moth Avhich are careful to run concealed galleries in the wax to avoid their thrusts and in killing the drones The term waspish is derived from the irritable nature of those insects whose brusque and defiant manners are doubt less in large part due to the consciousness that they are well armed But in many wasps the sting is not only a weapon of defence but of prime importance in maintaining the ex istence of their young and consequently of the life of the species We have spent hours watching a Sphex wasp Sphex ichneumonea Fig 59 a large rustred species covered with dense golden hairs busily engaged in digging its hole in a gravelly walk Away it worked in a lusty hearty manner literally tooth and nail removing the larger bits of gravel with its large curved sicklelike jaws and as it finally tunnelled itself out of sight it would often back up out of its hole and scratch and shovel the dirt out with its fore and hind legs pushing back the dirt from the mouth of its hole with its long hairy hind legs As soon as its hole was a few inches deep perhaps four or five it flew off to the grassy bank close by and immediately returned with a green Fig 59 Sphex Wasp grasshopper which it had evidently stung and paralyzed as it did not kick and struggle It disappeared for a few min utes in its hole long enough apparently to lay an egg in the bod of the grasshopper which was destined only to awake from its deathlike lethargy to find itself the prey of the young Sphex That the sting of the wasp is so wonderfully guided as to pierce one of the nervous centres ganglia of the grass hopper so that the insect is paralyzed is proved by the ob servations of a French naturalist Fabre who has given us a charmingly written account of his experiences with a wasp called Cerceris which had been known to sting and conse quently paralyze its prey consisting of the larva or grub of a certain weevil M Fabre waylaid a Cerceris returning with her booty and substituted a fresh uninjured weevil grub for the one paralyzed This experiment succeeded to admiration As soon as the Cerceris perceived her prey to have slipped from her grasp she struck the earth with her feet and turned impatiently hither and thither then sud denly perceiving the living curcullo placed close to her by M Fabre pounced upon it and proceeded to carry it off Instantlj however discovering it to be still uninjured she placed herself face to face with it seized its rostrum be tween her powerful mandibles and pressed her fore legs heavily upon its back as if to cause the opening of some ventral articulation Quickly then she slid her abdomen beneath the curculio and struck her venomous dart sharply twice or thrice into the joint of the prot4aorax between the first and second pair of legs In one second without a con vulsive movement without those twitches of the limbs which generally accompany the death agony of any animal the victim dropped motionless struck as if by lightning The Cerceris then turning the apparently lifeless insect on its back embraced it as before described and bore it away in triumph Three times did M Fabre repeat this interesting experiment each time with precisely similar results It must be clearly understood that on each occasion he re stored to the Cerceris her original captive and took pos session of that which he had himself provided in order to examine it at his leisure Greatly did he marvel at the dex terity with which the fatal stroke had been dealt Not the slightest trace of a wound was to be found not the least drop of vital liquid spilt The puncture made by the sting of the Cerceris is indeed so microscopic that chemistry can furnish no poison sufficiently powerful to produce with so small a quantity so startling an effect and it is in fact not so much to the Aenom of the dart as to the phjsiological im portance of the exact point at which it enters that we must ascribe the cessation so complete so instantaneous of all active life In most insects there are three ganglia which furnish the nerves of the wings and legs and on which the power of movement principally depends The first that of the pro thorax is distinct from the others in all Coleoptera but the last two those of the meso and metathordx though generally separate are in some species united Now it is a wellknown fact that in most cases the more closely the nervous sjstem is united centralized as it were tho more perfect are the animal functions and also of course the more easily vulnerable Therefore the Cerceris whose instinct teaches her at one stroke to annihilate these functions chooses her victims precisely from the species in which this centralization is most complete In order completely to establish his opinion it remained for M Fabre to prove that he could by similar means pro duce a similar result And this he found himself able to psrfoira with perfect ease by puncturing the insect with a needle dipped in ammonia at the prothoracic joint behind the first pair of legs Any corrosive liquid applied to the thoracic medullary centre would have the same effect His experiments were made upon the grubs of various beetles In the case of Scarabaii Buprestes and Curculionldn the effect of his experiments was instantaneous all motion ceased suddenly without a single convulsion at the instant the fatal drop touched the medullary centre Not the dart of the Cerceris herself could have a more prompt or last ing effect Notwithstanding their complete immobility M Fabres victims remained alive for tSree weeks or a month preserving the flexibility of all their joints and the normal freshness of their viscera My own observations on finother wasp Ochjnerns aIbo2JIia leratus which makes its round cells of clay placing them for safety in the 1 ose nest of the American Tent Caterpillar have shown me that Fabres account must be correct On opening these cells they were found to be filled with minute caterpillars which were in various stages of growth between the fully formed caterpillar and the chrysalis The were alive but benumbed and in some cases with life enough to finish their transformations into the chrysalis state Here they were waiting patiently each for his turn to be devoured by the young wasp What a marvellous instinct on the part of the wasp and how much more wonderful when we remem ber that this is a habit of but certain groups of wasps and that it must have been acquired by fig 60 them from some ancestor which had to find out for itself the secret of sting ing its victim so as to simply paralyze and not kill outright the luckless subject of the experiment Again was the discovery made by accident or did our ancestral wasp go about it like a philosopher and after conducting a series of experi ments guided by the scientific use of the imaginatioti alight finally upon just the weak siot in its victims harness in which to insert its sting This thought may be consid ered as twaddle by some but in all seriousness Ave would say that nature must have had that insect in training Anj one who has observed a wasp building its nest or a Chr3sis wasp Fig 60 exploring the nail holes in a post with its inquisitive sting combining the terrible qualities of a poisoned dagger with the delicate touch of a finger and then imagines the series of deductions following each trial of the sting the momentous result attending the exploita tion to the future weal of the Chrysis family and the ulti mate good to the species how can he say that there we have not a reasoning being under the tuition of natures laws In like manner the Tarantula Killer Pompilus formosus Fig Gl according to an exceedingly interesting account published by Dr Lincecum in the American Naturalist May 1SG7 attacks that immense spider the Mygale Ilevt zii Fig 61 paralyzes it with its formidable sting and in serting an egg in its body places it in its nest dug to the Fig 61 Tarantula Killer depth of five inches There are hundreds of other species of wasps thus solely dependent on the adroit use of their stings for the means of providing for their offspring The poison of the spider which is seldom fatal to man is lodged in a little gland or sac situated in the headthorax and Avhich opens into the jaws which are hollow perforated at the end so as to allow the poison to flow into the wound made by the mandible But very few spiders are poisonous 16 to man Hentz our best American authority after twenty years of study declare that spiders were not poisonous to man Bhickwall the English authority says that none in England are poisonous as he allowed them to Lite him ou Fig C2 Trap door Spider Mygale different parts of his person without any harm resulting Occasionally we see deaths reported from the bite of spiders A late number of Nature contains a notice of the Katipo or venomous spider of New Zealand Its bite is occa 6 17 sionally fatal and certainly very painful and distressing This spider belongs to the genns Latrodectus and AValck onaer says the same journal writing of the Latrodectus malmignatics an allied species common in Sardinia and Cor sica and parts of Italy remarks This spider is certainly poisonous its bite they sa causes in man pain lethargy and sometimes fever A species of the same genus which lives in Georgia is said by Ilentz and not Abbot as ISiature says to have an undoubtedly venomous bite As regards the bite and habits of the scorpion the testi mony of Anderssen the African traveller may be cited as the common experience of inhabitants in the tropics lie says Tlie instant the scorpion feels himself in contact with any part of tlic body of a man or beast he lifts his tail and with his horny sting inflicts a wound which though rarely fatal is still of a painful nature Like the snake the scoriion is fond of warmth and it is not uncommon on awakening in the morning to find one or two of these horrid creatures snugly ensconced in the folds of the blanket or under the pillow On one occasion I killed a scorpion measuring nearly seven and a half inches in length that had thus un ceremoniousl introduced itself into my bed The poison gland of the scorpion as everybody knows is lodged in the tail The scorpion is a timorous creature and only uses its sting when alarmed Dr Lincecum has published in the American Naturalist an interesting account of the scorpion of Texas a figure of which we reproduce Fig G3 He says that it dwells under old logs rocks in old stumps under the bark of dead trees under old fences Itetween the shingles on housetops and par ticularly about the jambs and hearths of fireplaces In tem per they are hasty and will employ their weapons on slight occasions The pain caused by their venom when injected into ones flesh is very quickly felt and quite severe giving the idea of a burninghot fluid thrown into the system It does not last long nor does it swell much and is not so pain ful nor does it produce so much iuconvenience as the sting of the honey bee In countries where they abound people do not regard them with much terror Chickens are very fond of them and voraciously devour every one they can find The scorpion brings forth its young alive The centipede is an annoying and even dangerous insect the poison glands are lodged in the head opening into the Fig C3 American Scorpion channelled jaws as in the spiders The bite of the larger species is most formidable Few are aware how painful and anno3ing is the irritation set up by the hairs of certain caterpillars The hairs of many kinds are finely barbed such are those of the Ctenucha figured in our frontispiece The caterpillar feeds on grass and I extract from my notes an account of the mode in which it constructs its cocoon tearing its slender barbed 10 84 hairs from its body and dextrously weaving them into a firm texture without the aid of silken threads the hairs being held firmly in place by the barbs June 13th the Ctenucha larva began to construct its co coon Early in the morning it described an ellipse upon the side of the glass vessel of hairs plucked from just behind the head From this elliptical line as a base it had by eight oclock built up rather unequally the wall of its cocoon in some places a third of the distance up by simply piling upon each other the spinulated hairs which adhered firmly to gether At four oclock in the afternoon the arch was com pleted and the larva walled in by a light thin partition Soon afterwards the thin floor was made No silk is spun throughout the whole operation I afterwards carefully ex amined portions of the cocoon under the microscope and could detect no threads of any kind From this it will appear that aside from their defensive nature these barbed hairs come into play when the insect prepares to lay aside its caterpillar skin like an old garment and go into retirement as a chrjsalis So also the hairs of the woolly bear caterpillar Arctia Isabella and of the common Vanessa butterfly Vanessa Antiopa are poisonous to children The caterpillar of another moth the Emietla stimulea is said by Dr Clemens to be very annoying The spines with which the horns are supplied produce an exceedingly painful sensation when they come in contact with the back of the hand or any portion of the body in which the skin is thin The caterpillar of the lo moth Tlypercheiria lo Fig G4 65 a 6 c spines which feeds commonly on corn in the southern states though in New England it feeds on the maple is covered with stinging hairs which are often pain ful when detached The caterpillar of the Maia moth Hemileuca Maia Fig 66 a caterpillar is armed with still more annoying spines We are indebted to Mr J A Lintner for an excellent ac count of certain experiments with this caterpillar which Fig G4 Caterpillar of lo Jloth after Kiley we copy from his paper in the Report of the New York State Cabinet for ISGO He remarks that a larva was 21 8G dropped three or four times from a height of about ten inches upon the bacli of the first joint of the thumb The sensation did not differ materially in kind from the sting of the nettle but was more acute In a few minutes the sur face became reddened and in a short time numerous sliglitly elevated whitish blotches made their appearance accompa nied with a burning and itching The following day the thumb could not be bent without experiencing a sensible Fig CG 3y a ¦ i Caterpillar and Pupa of Maia Moth after Riley degree of pain which was materially increased by an attempt to bring the joint to a right angle This stiffness of the joint continued for four days When the blotches subsided small purplish spots of coagulated blood appeared in their place which by degrees became more circumscribed until after the lapse of a few days when they presented an appear ance similar to that of grains of gunpowder burned beneath the skin These gradually disappeared those nearer the surface by a scaling of the skin above theni those deeper removed by the slower process of absorption were visible at least two weeks When the larva was permitted to fall upon the thicker skin of the palm of the hand a slight stinging sonsation was experienced and minute purple dots wcre developed continuing a shorter time than the above The sting is doubtless the result not of broken tips of the spines remaining in the flesh for none such could be observed by careful scrutiny with a lens but of a poison secreted by the larva and probably injected through a mi nute aperture in the tip of the spine Whether its excretion is voluntary or involuntary was not determined it not having occurred to institute the simple experiment by which that point could readily have been ascertained A slight motion of the larva apparently a contractile one was fre quently observed to accompany the sting but this may have been either defensive or simply the consequence of alarm at being rudelj touched Some tips of the spines clipped off and placed between slides under a high magnifying power showed under varying pressure a motion of fluid within them but no apical opening could be discovered for its escape The ability to inflict a sting does not belong to all the spines of the larva but ordy to those of the two subdorsal rows on segments three to ten and the dorsal spine on seg ment eleven These differ from those elsewhere on the body in their fascicular arrangement their lesser length the regular taper of the branches and their tawny color as ap pears in detail in the description given of the mature larva With tills interesting structural peculiarity in mind the larva may be handled with impunity as was repeatedly done with the fift or more individuals composing the colony from which these notes were drawn in the frequent transfers which tliey That a poison is secreted seems to us improbable required as they approaelied maturity to fresh food and cleansed quarters With proper care the thumb and fingers could safelj be passed along their sides and beneath them slowly raising them from the leaf or stem to which they were attached but if attempted too hastily the larva throws it self in a circle projects its defensive armor and inflicts a sting which effectually releases it from the grasp Now while nature has protected these caterpillars from their insect enemies though certain ichneumon flies prey upon them they seem whether by reason of their spiny hairs or stiff bristles or other cause to be distasteful to birds We are not aware how different are the tastes of birds for different food as with us so with birds de gustibus non dis putandum We observe how different and arbitrary are the tastes of the dog or horse or cat so wild animals including birds have their individual preferences and dislikes for cer tain kinds of food Certain it is that there are many kinds of caterpillars which birds will not eat The false cater pillar of the cherry sawfly Selandria cerasi is said b Pro fessor Winchell to be never eaten b birds The currant saw fly worm now so destructive in our gardens is not eaten by birds In my First Annual Report on the Injurious and Beneficial Insects of Massachusetts 1871 occur the follow ing remarks on this point As this is an important and practical subject let us digress for a moment to notice some facts brought out by Mr J J Weir of the London Entomological Societ on the insects that seem distasteful to birds He finds by caging up birds whose food is of a mixed character purely insecteating birds could not be kept alive in confinement that all hairy caterpillars were uniformly uneaten such caterpillars are the yellow bears Arctia and Spilosoma the saltmarsh caterpillars Leu carctia acraca and the caterpillar of the vaporer moth Orgyia and the spring laivre of butterflies with these may perhaps be classed the European currant sawfly was disposed to consider that the flavor of all these cater pillars is nauseous and not that the mechanical trouble someness of the hairs prevents their being eaten Larvte which spin webs and are gregarious are eaten by birds but not with avidity they appear very much to dislike the web sticking to their beaks and those completely concealed in the web are left unmolested When certain branches cov ered with the web of Iluponomeuta evonymella a little moth of the Tinea family were introduced into the aviary those larvaj only which ventured bejond the protection of the web were eaten Smoothskinned gayljcolored caterpillars such as the currant Abraxas or span worm Fig 39 which never con ceal themselves but on the contrary appear to court obser vation Avere not touched by the birds He states on the other hand that all caterpillars whose habits are nocturnal and are dullcolored with fleshy bodies and smooth skins are eaten with the greatest avidity Every species of green caterpillar is also much relished All Geometrae whose larvae resemble twigs as they stand out from the plant on their anal prolegs are invariably eaten Mr A G Butler of London has also found that frogs and spiders will not eat the same larvse rejected by birds the frogs having an especial aversion to the currant span worms Abraxas and Halia Before leaving the subject of poisonous insects we maj refer to those which are indirectly so Professor Leidy has as we find in the American Naturalist vol vi p C94 entertained the opinion that flies are probably a means of communicating contagious disease to a greater degree than was generally suspected From what he ob served in one of the large military hospitals in which hos pital gangrene had existed during the late rebellion he thought flies should be carefully excluded from wounds Recently he noticed some flies greedily sipping the diflhient matter of some fungi of the Phallus impudicus He caught 25 90 TACKkKD several and found that on holding them by the wings tlioy would exude two or three drops of liquid from the proboscis whicli examined by the microscope were found to swarm with the spores of the fungus The stomach was likewise filled with the same liquid swarming with spores Among other insects which frequently annoy travellers in the southern states and in the tropics are the ticks Fig G7 It is the habit of these beings to climb up bushes and stalks of grass and attach themselves by means of their outstretched legs to whatever animal passes by whether a Fig G7 CatUe Tick enlarged beast or lizard or snake as they occur on all creeping ani mals Having attached themselves by their jaws to the skin they burrow beneath it causing a painful tumor It is difficult to pull them out as they are anchored in the flesh by their manybarbed tongue We turn again to Anderssens narrative for an account of the plague this tick ma be to the wanderer in Africa Besides rajriads of fleas our encampment swarmed with a species of bushtick whose bite was so severe and irrita ting as almost to drive us mad To escape if possible the  horriblo persecutions of these bloodtliirsty creatures I took refuge one night in the cart and was congratulating myself on having at last secured a place free from their attacks But I was mistaken I had not been long asleep before I was awakened by a disagreeable irritation over my whole body which shortly became intolerable and notwithstand ing the night air was very sharp and the dew heavy I cast off all my clothes and rolled on the icycold sand till the blood flowed freely from every pore Strange as it may appear I found this expedient serviceable On another occasion a bushtick but of a still more poi sonous species attached itself to one of my feet and though a stinging sensation was produced I never thought of examining the part till one day when enjoying the unu sual luxury of a cold bath I accidentally discovered the in truder deeply buried in the flesh and it was only with very great pain that I succeeded in extracting it or rather its body for the head remained in the wound The poisonous effect of its bite was so acrimonious as to cause partial lameness for the three following months The bushtick docs not confine its attacks to men only for it attaches itself with even greater pertinacity to the inferior animals Many a poor dog have I seen killed by its relentless persecutions and even the sturdy ox has been known to succumb

brighter side to the picture In sects are not all leagued together to destroy our com fort and rob our pockets There is the honey bee one of our domestic animals if well treated patient and kind ceaselessly at work for our benefit Ilcr life is a con stant lesson of thrift and industry Thanks to Messrs  Langstroth Quimby and AYagner bee culture has become with us oue of the fine arts iu agriculture and a few hives are necessaiy adjuncts to a well conducted farm The pro duction of honey and wax has enormously increased in this countr and it is to be hoped that out of the thousands who keep bees one or two at least may arise who like Iluber Siebold Leuckart Dzierzon and Berlepsch in the old world nia advance our knowledge of the economy of the bee and its modes of reproduction so intricate and wonderful and thus lay still broader and deeper the foundations of scien tific bee culture We need not here speak at length on a subject so familiar to many as the structure and habits of the honey bee and of the various other kinds of bees which store up honey One point however and an important one has quite recently been cleared up by a German naturalist Professor Claus The production of wax is a most important part of bee culture especially in Catholic countries where so nian candles are used in churches It is well known that the secretion of wax is carried on during the time when the workers are engaged in building their combs We are all familiar at least through pictures with the festoons of bees hanging from the top of their hives During this time of repose the secretion of the little disks of wax goes on IIow is the wax secreted The best authorities have diftered on this important point On the one hand MilneEdwards the distinguished French naturalist supposed that the wax secreting apparatus consisted of special glands while an equally eminent German Von Siebold thought that no such glands existed A countryman of Von Siebold however Prof Claus has from special investigations of his own confirmed MilneEdwards suppositions I quote from a translation of a part of Claus article in the Guide to the Study of Insects The waxsecreting apparatus consists of special dermal glands as MilneEdwards supposed Claus has shown sec Gegcnbaurs Vergleichenden Anatomic that 29 94 HALF HOURS WETH JXSECTS IPacicatd these minute glands are mostly unicellular the external opening being through a fine chitinons tube on the outer sur face of the integument In the waxproducing insects the glands are developed in great numbers over certain portions of the body In the Aphides whose bodies are covered with a powder consisting of fine waxy threads these glands are collected in groups Modifications of them appear in the Coccidse In the waxproducing Hjanenoptera the apparatus is somewhat complicated The bees secrete wax in thin transparent membranous plates on the under side of the abdominal segments Polygonal areas are formed by the openings of an extraordinarily large number of fine pore canals in which surrounded by very numerous tracheal branches the C3dindrical gland cells are densel piled upon each other These form the wax organs over which a fatty lajer spreads In those bees which do not produce wax the glands of the wax organs are slightly developed Wax organs also occur in the humble bees I find in the Academy for Feb 13 1873 that Dr Von Schneider is of the opinion that wax which he thinks is undoubtedly a secretion of the honey bee is formed chiefly at the ex pense of different kinds of sugar but he considers that the production of wax from sugar cannot be maintained without simultaneous access to food containing nitrogen As regards the mode of production of honey which we are much in the dark about as we haAe heretofore only known that it is elaborated by some unknown chemical proc ess from the food contained in the crop and Avhich is re gurgitated into the honey cells Von Siebold throws more light upon it by his able anatomical researches aided by tlie chemist Von Schneider From the Academy we learn that at the annual agricultural meeting held in Oc tober 1871 at Munich a well known apiarian Ilerr Meh ring exhibited a peculiar kind of honey that he named KunstHonig artificial honey and which he had produced by feeding his bees exclusively with malt This honey excited great interest and the question was raised whether this substance was real honey and whether consequently the bee was able to change maltsugar in its stomach into honey Dr Von Schneider arrived at the conclusion that the carbohydrates sucrose and dextrose contained in the malt are actually changed by the bee into honey sugar and that Mehrings honey only differs from other honeys in the absence of the specific aroma which is imparted to them by the flowers from which the bees have been gathering Now adds the Academy in quoting the account from the Bienen Zeitung after the fact had been established that honey and wax are not substances found as such by the bee but are productions which hae undergone chemical change through contact with the secretions of the insect Prof Von Siobold directed his attention to the investigation of the se creting organs a branch of anatomy which indeed had not been entirely neglected but which is now treated for the first time with regard to the special functions those organs appear to perform in the preparation of the products of the bee Prof Von Siebold distinguishes three entirely distinct and very complicated sjstems of salivary glands tivo of which a lower and upper are situated in the head and the third in the anterior part of the thorax the latter having been erroneously regarded by Fischer as a hing Each of them has separate excretory ducts and is distinguished by a specifically different form and organization of the vesicles secreting the saliva Each consists of a right and left glandular mass with right and left excretory ducts For the detailed account of their minute structure we must refer to the paper itself and the late accompanying it It may liowever be mentioned that this extraordinary development of the salivar organs has been observed by Prof Von Siebold in the workers only The queen possesses only a rudiment of the lower cephalic system in the form of the 3 two orifices of the ducts while the ducts themselves as well as the glands are absent and the two other systems are much less developed than in the workers In the drones not even the orifices of the lower cephalic sjstem could be found We maj now consider the other waxproducing insects whose products at first found in such minute quantities go to swell the wealth of nations as in Great Britain alone about 1000000 worth of wax is used While there is true vegetable wax formed on the berries of our Candlemas bush or Bayberry Myrica jet the pela wax of China is se creted by a certain kind of Coccus or barklouse Westwood in his Modern Classification of Insects vol ii p 449 tells us that the Coccus ceriferus Fabr described by An derson in his letters from Madras 1781 and b Pearson in the London Philosophical Transactions 1794 is employed in the production of a white wax the body of the female being enveloped in a thick and solid coat of it We have with us certain kinds of bark lice which secrete a woolly mass which envelops their body Such is the mealy bug found upon our house plants and to which we shall again refer in subsequent pages We have glanced at some of the relations of insects to ourselves and if some memories not altogether of an agree able nature have been awakened yet upon the whole it will be felt that these little beings serve some good purpose in the world and minister in many ways to our personal com fort 32

creature We learn to observe much more iapidly and accuratcl b drawing the object while our thoughts are more aroused by the deliberate use of the pencil Observe the long slender feelers or antennoi those deli cate tactile organs which act at once as feelers as ears and sometimes as in the case of the carrion beetles as noses since it is b means of the sense organs lodged in the broad clubshaped feelers of these insects that they are enabled to scent their wa to the carrion in which they lay their eggs That the are delicate organs of touch any one can convince himself who observes the aphis or other insects while walk ing Scarcely a step is taken until the air and ground or twig on which it treads has been thoroughly explored by these divining rods which never fail in imparting knowledge on which their owner may be said to stake its life No one however slight his knowledge of the habits of insects will deny that the antcnne are rightly called feelers That the delicate sense of touch with which the antennai are endowed sometimes serves insects in the absence of all the other senses is shown in the case of the cave insects in some of which the eyes are entirely wanting It is not unfrequently the case that the antennte of cave insects arc much longer and more delicate than those of their fellows which live an outofdoor life Here the loss of sight has been made up to the insect by the increased sensibility of the feelers Writers on the habits of cave insects I refer particularly to the papers of the Danish naturalist Schiodte describe the extreme caution with which they explore the ground over which the arc about to walk feeling and groping in the dark for their pre or watching the movements of their adver saries in this game of llinl mans buff among the coUunns and stalactites of their grotto antennse besides being feelers are also ears has l5een proved by Prof A M Mayer At a late meeting of tiie National Academy of Sciences held in New York he made a series of exceedingly ingenious experiments which confirm the theorem of Fourier as applied by him in his propositions relating to the nature of a simple sound and to the analysis b the ear of a composite sound into its ele mentary pendulumvibrations and which elucidate the Iw pothesis of audition of Helmholtz Placing a male mosquito under the microscope and sounding various notes of tuning forks in the range of a sound given by the female mosquito the various fibres of the antennae of the male mosquito vibrated sympathetically to these sounds The longest fibres vibrated sympathetically to the grave notes and the short fibres vibrated sympathetically to the higher notes The fact that the nocturnal insects have highly organized antennre while the diurnal ones have not and also the fact that the anatomy of these parts of insects shows a highly developed nervous organization lead to the highly probable inference that Prof Mayer has here given facts which form the first sure basis of reasoning in reference to the nature of the auditory apparatus of insects These experiments were also extended in a direction which added new facts to the ph3siology of the senses If a sonorous impulse strike a fibre so that the direction of the impulse is in the direction of the fibre then the fibre remains stationary But if the direction of the sound is at right angles to the fibre the fibre vibrates with its maximum in tensity Tims when a sound strikes the fibrils of an insect those on one antenna are vibrated more powerfully than the fibrils on the other and the insect naturally turns in the di rection of that antenna which is most strongly shaken The fibrils on the other antenna aie now shaken with more and more intensity until having turned his body so that both antennas vibrate with equal intensity he has placed the axis  of his body in the direction of the sound Experiments under tlie microscope show that the mosquito can thus detect to within five degrees the position of the sonorous centre To render assurance doubly sure Prof Maer having found two fibrils of the antennae of a mosquito which vibrated pow erfully to two different notes measured these fibrils very accurately under the microscope He then constructed some fibrils out of pine wood which though two or throe feet long and of the thickness of small picturecord had exactly the same proportion of length to thickness as the fibrils of the antennae of the mosquito He found that these slender pine rods or fibrils had the same ratio of vibration to each other as the fibrils of the mosquito Here a question arises The song of the mosquito is un doubtedly a sexual call Does the male detect the presence Fig 71 Ocean Gntt of its female charmer by the different tones of her voice Certainly the ears of the male with its feathered antennae arc far more acute than those of the opposite sex the an tcnujie in her case mostly wanting those long vibratile hairs that give to him his acuteness of hearing In this case 5 102 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS certainly the longest ears give the greater wisdom however it may be among certain higher animals with a less number of feet than our mosquito boasts The bushy antennae of the feathered gnats Chironomus are perhaps still more acute organs of hearing than those of the mosquito and here the great difference between the antennce in the sexes may be seen by a glance at the accompanying figure 71 of the common ocean gnat of our harbors the lower figure representing the antennae of the female with their few short scattered hairs while those of the male are very bushy The feelers of many moths are delicately feathered those of the males being invariably with longer branches than in the other sex They are particularly well developed in the males of the silkworm moths as for example in the large handsome Luna moth see PI 2 representing however the female The females of this group particularly are quite stationary while the more active restless males may be seen sailing majestically through the air in the twilight If a female of this family be confined in a room or in a box out of doors numbers of suitors for her hand and heart will come from far and wide Collectors of insects take advan tage of this trait which they call assembling It is stated in an English work that an entomologist while walking out with a female Emperor moth in a box in his pocket Avas at tended by twenty or thirty males fluttering anxiously about his person They have also been known to seek their part ners held captive in the city of Manchester from a distance of ten miles out of town Now what is the faculty by which these sparks with their antennae gayly feathered and plumed and wings if not hearts fluttering wildl seek the presence of those undemonstrative if not stolid damsels It is not by the sense of sight because it is in the darkness of the night and the darker and more foggy the night the better Moreover moths cannot see through the walls of houses nor into the collecting bos in the pocket of the insect hunter 6 PACKAUD rSECTS OF THE PLANT HOUSE 103 It is not by the sense of hearing as in the mosquito for these lepidopterous damsels have not the gift of song Tiiey are silent as the Sphinx It is not 1 the sense of touch as they wing their way from places miles distant Unless it is by the sense of smell a modification it is true of the sense of touch we are unable to account for this trait of assembling That burying beetles perceive carrion at great distances through the sense of smell is not a matter of doubt and it is not unreasonable to suppose that undulations of odoriferous particles moving like waves of sound and light strike the delicate branches and hairs of the male antennae causing them to vibrate in unison and thus powerfully excite the amatory nature of these ardent suitors So much for the feelers of insects in general and those of our Aphis Fig 72 in particular Now as we are drawing Fig 72 Aphis the legs we ma notice that there are six of them attached to the sides of the middle region of the bod the thorax The number is invariably six in all winged insects The thorax consists of three segments or rings and to the side of each ring a pair of legs is attached Now the legs are tubelike jointed at intervals ending in two short toe joints In most insects there are five such joints in the toe and ten joints in all The last joint ends in a pair of long and slender claws The hind body or abdomen is full and rounded alder manic in its proportions and provided with two tubes which 7 104 HALF HOURS WITH ISECTS rACKARD project out from near the end of the body From these two tubes issues the socalled honey dew the delight of the sweet toothed ant When a brood of aphides are busily engaged in tapping the stems of some plant and the honey dew is dropphig upon the ground or leaves below a procession of sable ants enliven the scene This sweet fluid is also designed to afford nourislunent for the young as soon as hatched Both Bonnet and the Belgian naturalist Morren observed that the young Aphides as soon as born sucked up the fluid with their beaks and thrived upon that for awhile before attacking the juices of the plant itself It has been a matter of curiosity to us how this thin fluid is secreted Moiren has demonstrated that these tubes are in reality modified respirator organs as Bonnet had sup posed They are simply tubular elongations of the skin with a hole at the end into which the air enters while the sweet fluid escapes from the same hole On dissecting the little creature a task requiring much time and patience Morren found a network of air tubes tracheae near the base of each tube This tube he says is onl a prolonged stigma and it becomes evident that it is the air of these tra cheae which forces out the fluid with which this appendage is often filled At the base of the tube he also found a gland which secretes the sweet liquid The latter passes into the tube or excretory canal at the same time as the air within picsses out The viscous liquid is thus thrown out during expiration Morren tells us that he has several times seen the 3oung Aphides suck the end of these tubes while holding their beaks near it This always happened whenever I was able to have the females bring forth their young in vials Mithout any leaves to serve as food for either the young or its mother Now a gland situated on the sur face of the bod provided with an excretory canal and se creting a sweet fluid intended to nourish the young is in fact Aiiiales des Snences Nuturelles Tome P Second series ISM Paris 8 INSECTS OF THE PLANT HOUSE 105 a mammary gland and he then compares these insects in this respect to the mammals Now upon pressing the body of the Aphis placed in a drop of water in the animalcule stage we readily squeeze out the contents of the abdomen including the ovaries Instead of a numerous mass of eggs in various degrees of maturit we are astonished to see a series of young Aphides in va rious stages of development The creature brings forth its young alive Moreover the parent as Bonnet observed is a virgin No males are in existence The first brood hatch ing out in the spring are all females As soon as the leaves unfold the virgin rears its brood of young these in turn produce their spinster offspring and the number of broods is only limited by the approach of frost Finall after from eight to ten broods males and females appear the latter lay fertilized eggs by which the species is represented during the winter Such are the powers of multiplication of these Aphides that a sringborn virgin ma become tlie happy mother of a luintillion daughters and granddaughters At least such is the belief of M Fougard as quoted by Prof Morren in his well known paper Sur le Puceron du Pecher A certain species which Fougard calls Puceron lanigere produces ten viviparous generations and one oviparous gen eration PLach generation produces from ninety to one hun dred and

Regarding this estimate of what one Aphis can do to pop ulate the world Prof Huxley makes the following state ment I will assume that an Aphis weighs onethousandth of a grain which is under the mark a quintillion will on this estimate weigh a quadrillion of grains He is a very stout man who weighs two million grains consequently the tenth brood alone if all its members survive the perils to which they are exposed contains more substance than five hundred million stout men to say the least more than the whole population of China That the individual with the potential ability to produce such A mass of young only suc ceeds in leaving perhaps two eggs to represent its species at the beginning of winter all its offspring dying off is a sig nificant fact illustrating forcibl the teirible struggle for ex istence going on in the animal world I scarcely know how to present in a popular way the mode of growth of the embryo Aphis It has been Avell described by Huxley and in a more exhaustive manner by the Russian naturalist Metznikoff This study of the earliest phases in the life of an insect or in fact any animal leads us up to the very threshold of the m3sterious portals of life The problem given is a sac full of protoplasm a drop of jelly like the jelly in the cell of a plant to our eyes the same so far as our finite analysis at present extends and 3et poten tially an animal even representing the initial point of man himself How is this result attained This drop of oily jelly contains another sac filled with albumen called the nucleus Now when that mysterious act the mingling of the contents of a sperm cell with the ovarian cell or as in the virgin Aphis the act of budding the simplest genera tive process known has occurred let us with the practised eve of our Russian guide watch the behavior of the two ele ments the general oily contents of the cgg or yolk and the albuminous nucleus The original protoplasmic mass has prior to the union with a sperm cell increased in size and 10 Packaud insects of  become filled with 3olk cells or granules After fertilization the nucleus subdivides into smaller cells These seek the outer region of the egg They multiply a thousand fold become iressed together lose their character as distinctive cells and form a pale band partly or wholly surrounding the yolk mass This is the primitive band the germ which grows at the expense of the jolk cells Finally feet and jaws and antenna bud out from the band until tiie form of an Aphis is rudely sketched out Mark the fact one of the most interesting in the morphology of animals that at first the only difference between the antennaB and jaws and the legs are in their position Identical in form the antennie and jaws differ from the limbs fig 73 simpl in the fact that they are situated in front of the legs Now as each pair of appendages whether legs or jaws or antennae indicate a segment or ring we at once get a clew by which we can easily settle the question of the number of segments in the head of the winged insects Here following one another in orderly succession are four pairs of protrusions like the fingers of a glove beginning with the antenune the foremost and ending with the labium the pair next the legs So we have four segments in the head In after life the segments clearly to be seen in the embryo become so coalesced that it is impossible to define their limits In most books the head is quite wrongly counted as one segment An important point clearl demonstrated by MetznikofiT is one bearing on the question of the origin of sex It is maintained by some that wellfed caterpillars for example produce female butterflies while starved ones produce males 1 antcnnw 2 mandibles 3 flrst pair of maxilla 4 aecoud pair 57 legs 11 12 3 4 5 6 7 Embryo of Dragon Fly 108 But it is generally and correctly thought that sex is deter mined at the time of conception Now in the Aphis embryo at a stage long before even the rudiments of feet appear Metznikoff figures certain cells which are destined to form eggs and soon after the germ has acquired limbs a mass of these eggs may be plainly seen So the egg is to our eyes feminine almost as soon as it begins to grow It is interesting to watch the finishing strokes Nature puts to her master pieces Shortly before hatching the embryo so far as regaixls the mouthparts resembles that of a fly or beetle or bee nearly as much as a bug and it is to be remem bered that the beak of the Aphis is really a verj complex affair It is composed of jaws mandibles and the front pair of maxillaj which form two pairs of bristlelike organs ensheathed within the labium or under lip second maxillifi INIctznikoffs figures show us how this wonderful transforma tion of parts takes place How the mandibles and first max illae suffer an arrest of development while the second pair of maxillae are greatly enlarged and joined together to form the socalled labium or under lip until finally the parts as sume the beaklike form of tlie mature insect Thus from the simplest of beginnings the most complex results follow Give me a point on which to rest my lever said Archimedes and I will lift the world Give me a drop of protoplasm sa3s the biologist and I will con struct the world of animals and plants Let us remember that all animals as well as plants except oneceiled ones result from the subdivision of a single primitive cell and that simple as this process is yet mystery upon mystery accompanies each process What is the power that urges on the self division of cells that arranges them into forms so varied as the world presents Is life a function of proto plasm What is the difference between these sacs of pro toplasm that one becomes a plant another a monad another a fish and another to speak in the concrete a Shakspeare   or a Humboldt Simple as the process appears to our eyes the determinuig cause is still an uufathomed myster3 The humble truthseeking observer can only ponder and work on hoping that the solution may be possible to his race Cer tainly all is not known when with some naturalists and phi losophers we attempt to settle the question by saying that life is a Iunction of protoplasm though it is granted that life on this globe does not exist without it For protoplasm is po tentially a very variable substance and life a problem quite beyond the science of our day to settle whatever may be the flood of light thrown upon the question by modern science The life force existing in protoplasm is powerless witliout an Infinite intelligence and will urging it on in its destined channels just as muscular force is subject to the finite will that calls it forth Though muscular force is a function of muscle that does not account for a muscular act nor does the nerve cell or fibre account for a nervous act both are impelled by a will force not of themselves as INIatthew Arnold would say So at the outset all life may have been the re sult of chemicophysical forces producing from its elements and acting upon the compound thus produced which we call protoplasm Still this act of spontaneous generation was none the less under the guidance of an allpervading intelli gence and will Sontaneous generation is not selfcreation So the study of our little Aphides ends in starting a series of questions that haunt us each step we take some of them the largest that baffle the human reason Certainly the mind of the naturalist need not grow rusty Problems of matter and life and spirit assail him on every side and the calm ness patience and breadth of conception their consideration involves are a fitting preparation for encountering the prob lems of his own existence Our studies over now arises a practical piestion How shall we exterminate these troublesome pests In dealing with these insects in the hot house where there are no insect 13 no enemies we are left solel to our own resources so feeble compared with natures The best remedy against plant lice is to fumigate the plant house with tobacco Shirley Hib bard says that the best fumigator is one with a revolving fan or a revolving cage containing the tobacco by means of which the smoke is blown out in a rapid dense killing cloud but an effectual instrument may be extemporized by knocking a liole in the side of a large flower pot and then having put some hot cinders and damp tobacco in it the nozzle of a bellows is placed against the hole and ejection promoted by gentle puffing Drenching the leaves with a syringe or Fig 74 Fig 75 INIealy bug female Scale insect young hose throwing hot water 150° F on them is the best remedy against all plant house pests After the drenching sprinkle powdered tobacco over the leaves Scale Insects If we take an imaginary wingless Aphis flatten the bod shorten and weaken the limbs elongate the beak into threads and endow it with a still more sluggish disposition we shall have a scale insect in its simplest form the Mealy bug of our conservatories Fig 74 enlarged It may be seen on comparison with the immature or larval form of the true scale insects Fig 75 enlarged that the female Metriy bug is but little more advanced in organization than these larvje though greatl exceeding them in size The male meal bug Coccus adonkhiin Linn is like the male scale insect Fig 76 enlarged and still more nearly resembles that of the cochineal Avhicli is

resembling spermaceti in appearance but not in compo sition being a cerotic ether known as cerotatc of ceryl of the formula C W° 0 It is crstalline and of a dazzling whiteness like spermaceti but more brittle and of a more fi brous texture It does not completely saponify by boiling in potash water but is completely decomposed when melted with potash yielding cerotate of potassium and hydrate of ceryl It is consumed in China for candles and also as a medicine It melts at about 118° F Prof Silliman quotes from a recent book by C C Cooper Travels of a Pioneer of Com merce in Pig Tail and Petticoats etc London 1871 the following interesting account of the cultivation of this wax insect On the third day we entered the white wax coun try so named from its producing the famous white wax of Szchuan which has been erroneously called vegetable wax This district was less undulating than that of the tea gardens and presented to the e3e a view of extensive plains sur rounded by low hills The plains were all under wax and rice cultivation the wax trees being planted round the embankments of the small paddy fields which were at most thirty yards square The country thus presented to the pass ing traveller the appearance of extensive groves of tree stumps each as thick as a mans thigh and all uniformly cut down to a height of about eight feet without a single branch The cultivation of wax is a source of great wealth to the province of Szchuan and ranks in importance second only to that of silk Its production is not attended with much labor or risk to the cultivator The eggs of tlic insect which produces the wax are annually imported from the districts of Ilochin or Iloking and AVliylitzou in Yunnan where the culture of the eggs forms a special occupation by mer chants who deal in nothing else but palatan white wax eggs The egg clusters which were described to me as about the size of a pea are transported carefully packed in baskets of the leaves of tlie palashu white Avax tree which re sembles a privetshrub and arrive in Szchuan in March where they are purchased at about twenty taels per basket The trees by the middle of Marcli have thrown out a number of long tender slioots and leaves and then the clusters of eggs enclosed in balls of the young leaves are suspended to the shoots by strings About the end of the month the larvai make their appearance feed on the branches and leaves and soon attain the size of a small caterpillar or rather a wingless house fly apparently covered with white down with a delicate plumelike appendage curving from the tail over the back So numerous are they that as seen by me in Yunnan the branches of the trees are whitened by them and appear as if covered with feathery snow The grub proceeds in July to take the chrysalis form burying itself in a white wax secre tion just as a silkworm wraps itself in its cocoon of silk All the branches of the trees are thus completely coated with wax an inch thick and in the beginning of August are lopped off close to the trunk and cut into small lengths which arc tied up in bundles and carried to the boiling houses where they are transferred without further preparation to large caldrons of water and boiled until every particle of the waxy sulstance rises to the surface The wax is skimmed off and run into moulds in which shape it is ex ported to all parts of the empire It would seem that the wax growers find that it does not pay them to reserve any of the insects for their reproductive state and hence the necessity of importing the eggs from  Yunnan In the district of Hochin and AVhylitzou where the culture of the eggs is alone attended to both frost and snow are experienced so that it would not be difficult to rear the insect in Europe and considering its prolific nature the production of white wax might repay the trouble of accli matizing this curious insect A near relation of the wax is the cochineal insect which affords us such an invaluable d3e carmine This insect Fig 78 showing the Avingless female natural size and en larged and the twowinged male is now abundant on the prickly pear in one corner of our Union Key AYest where we have found both sexes in great abundance The grain is the female Coccus dried So much has been written about this useful in sect of its mode of life and the methods of collecting and preparing it that we will not Aveary our readers with a repetition of it Its value however in commerce is very great In 1855 before red garments became fashionable says Dr Lankester in his Uses of Animals Great Britain imported 1400 tons of cochineal it takes 70000 of these in sects to make a pound which was valued at about £700000 and since then their consumption has probably greatly in creased Carmine he adds is one of the most powerful of coloring matters one grain of it it is said will dye a single silk fibre upwards of three thousand yards in length Other kinds of Coccus produce a carmine dye and our own species were the individuals sufficiently abundant could be used for this purpose Before cochineal was introduced into Europe the bodies of another kind of Coccus known as grains of Kermes wore used in Europe especially about the shores of the Mediterranean Lankester says that it is found extensively in Algeria anl the red Fez caps which 10 Cochineal Insect 116 HALF nouns WITH insects Packaijd find their way into the European markets are dyed Yith Kermes Carmine is also made from it Manna is said to be produced by the stings of the Coccus manyiiparus first described by Ehrenberg who found it at Sinai growing on the tamarix The lac insect so valuable a commercial prod uct is a bark louse which lives in the East Indies on the Ficus religiosa This insect by its beak punctures the bark especially of the branches From this puncture exudes a quantity of vegetable matter which eventually surrounds the lac insect and her eggs and larvae and produces on the branch an irregular brown mass which encircles it and whicli when broken has a resinous aspect This is gum lac Lankestcr When found on the twigs it is called stick lac but after it has been pounded and the greater part of the coloring matter extracted by water it is called seed lac when melted down into cakes after it has been strained and formed into thin scales lump lac and shell lac The most troublesome scale insect found on cultivated plants is the white scale insect or Asjkliotus hromelioi Fig 79 The snowwhite round scales crowd one fig 7o another on the leaves of acacias the Olea fra grans Guidia simplex etc On

It closely resembles the apple scale insect and is called Aspidiotus Gloveru It is possibly the A aurantii or citii of southern Europe The fern bark louse or scale insect Fig 82 6 un derside enlarged found fre quently on ferns of the genus Pteris seems to be identical with the Lecanium of the ferns L fiUcum of European authors It is regularly oval elliptical Along the middle of the body runs a prominent Lecaniinn platyceiii and larva ridge considerably thickened in the middle with two trans verse ridges It is of a rosy tint pale around the edge of the body and with a darker patch in the angles between the median and transverse ridges beneath fieshcolored  Another Lecanium found on the leaves of Platjcerium alcicorne is L platycerii The scale is regularly oval flat tened slightly

female Fig 83 and larva enlarged is entirely flat beneath finely granulated and pale brown above The 3oung are thin and flat scale like and of a light reddish brown color The Plant House Aleiirodes Belonging to a group allied to the scale insects is a minute whitewinged insect which may be found in all its stages on fuschias the Salvia splen dens and out of doors in summer the tomato rising in clouds like snow flakes when disturbed These pretty ac FlG AkUiodL five beings Fig 84 en arged have pale yellow bodies and pure white un spotted powdery wings with dark red eyes the beak is very long

convex rather thick oval ellip tical with a fringe of hairlike filaments around the edge of the body from the top of which arise from six to nine long threads The Tlothotise Thrips Fig 8G magnified This is one of the greatest pests in our hothouses It is the Heliothrips hcemorrhoidalis of Burmeister In all its stages it may be found puncturing the leaves of liliaceous plants azalias Pelloa hastata aspidium pinks etc and by its attacks causing tlie surface of the leaf to turn red or white in blotches or sometimes the wliole leaf withers and whitens The larva and pupa are white long with short antenna2 After several successive changes it assumes the adult state and the pupa may be found in different stages of growth with the antennie turned under neath the head and the rudimentary wings folded to the sides of the body The ccs are pink The halfgrown young are shorter and broader than those fully ma ture The adult is black with the extren ity of the abdomen bright rust red The

be detected by the blotched and withered ap pearance of the leaves and the small Aveb Frequent show erings will reduce its numbers Sulphur dusted frequently over the leaves is an excellent remedy THE Crustacea afford in the northern lobster the spiny lobster of the tropics and numerous kinds of shrimps and crabs many choice bits for our larder Whether however any of the insects or their allies the spiders or even the worms will ever afford food to civilized man is a matter of grave doubt While the bulk of our animal food is given us by the vertebrated animals the ox sheep fowl and game being our main dependence the mollusks afford us the delicious oyster which we shall never be able to give up the less aristocratic clam handed over to the Pilgrim Fathers by tlie sagamores and their followers the delicious though rare scallop and the quahaug while mussels snails and whelks regale our transatlantic friends Honey is uni versally sought and that is an insect product but the flesh of insects is upon the whole repugnant to our feelings This is certainly unreasonable for multitudes of the locust or grasshopper of the East are eaten by Arabs and the savages in other jiarts of Africa We look with repugnance upon a roasted grasshopper but an Arab is said to have expressed his abhorrence at our eating raw oysters While in their sudden flights the grasshoppers cover the ground and eat up every green thing the natives adopt the sensible course of devouring them in turn The Bushman who is no farmer sings Yen even the wasting lociistswarm Which mighty nations dread To me nor terror brings nor liarm I mike of them my bread He collects them according to Andersson by lighting large fires directly in the path of their swarms As the insects pass over the flames their wings are scorched and they fall 24 Pacicaru EDIBLE INSECTS 121 Fig 87 lielpkssl to the ground They arc also he says collected by cartloads when the have retired to rest The locusts after being partially roasted are eaten fresh or they are dried in the hot ashes and then stored away for future emer gencies The natives reduce them also to powder or meal by means of two stones or a wooden mortar which powder when mixed with water produces a kind of soup or stir about I have tasted locusts prepared in various ways but I caraiot sa that I have found them very palatable But they must contain a vast deal of nourishment since the poor people thrive wonderfully on them He also states that ¦ the Cape Colony has been particularly subject to this dreadful scourge which is invariably followed by fam ine The inroads of the locusts are periodical ac cording to Pringle about once every fifteen years In 1808 after having laid waste a onsiderable portion of the country they disap peared and did not return until 1824 They then re mained for several years but in 1830 took their departure The locust is truly migratory the undeveloped partially winged young moving from one region to another lie quotes from Barrow who says that the larvie at the same time were emigrating to the northward The column of these imperfect insects passed the houses of two of our party who assured me that it continued moving forward without any interruption except by night for more than a month Of very similar habits is our redlegged grasshopper Caloptenus femiirrubrum Fig 87 b It appears at inter vals in immense swarms In 1871 it was ver destructive to grass in northern Maine seriously damaging the hay crop Destructive Grastehopiievs Lacicard It has also swarmed in Canada Dr Harris enumerates its visitations in New England in the last century when it de voured every green thing The habits of this species are not well known except that it appears in midsummer in the winged state The wingless larvae appear in June and as Harris recommends hay crops should be mown early before the insects fly in swarms The last of summer they couple and lay their eggs in holes in the earth Avhere they are hatched in the spring As Harris suggests this insect can only be kept under by concerted action on the part of farmers In the south of France the people make a business at certain seasons of the year probably in the autumn and late in the spring of col lecting locusts and their eggs the latter being turned out of the ground in little masses cemented and covered with a sort of gum in Avhich they are enveloped by the insects Various forms of dragnets can be invented for collecting them in large numbers and run if necessary through a field by horsepower The inventive genius of our farmers will easily suggest methods of gathering these insects by the bushel when they can be thrown into hot water and fed to swine An entomological friend has found by his own ex perience that roasted grasshoppers are excellent eating better than frogs Only let some enterprising genius of the kitchen once set the example of offering to his customers roasted grasshoppers raredone and fricasseed canker worms for we have it on the word of an entomologist that cater pillars are pleasing to the palate of man and these droves of entomological beeves will perchance supplant their ver tebrate rivals at the shambles and instead of cattle fairs we shall have grasshopper festivals and county caterpillar shows The Caloptenus spretas of Uhler Fig 87 a appears in immense numbers in the country between the Mississippi and the Rockj Mountains and extending from the Saskatch 26 Packakd edible IXSECTS 123 ewan river on the North to Texas Mr Scuddcr states that a third whether belonging to the same species or not is still uncertain has invaded at different times nearly all the country lying within the boundaries of the United States between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean Dr Lincecum thus describes the ravages of C spretus in Texas Last spring the young were hatched from the egg in the early days of March by the middle of the month they had destroyed half the vegetation although the insects were wingless and not larger than a housefly The first winged specimens were seen high in the air at about three in the afternoon as a light northerly breeze sprang up millions dropped to the earth covering the ground in an hour and destroying every green thing with avidil Dur ing the night they were quiet but at daybreak commenced to eat and continued until ten in the morning Avhen they all flew southward At about three oclock in the afternoon of the same day another swarm arrived ten times as numerous as the first these again took flight the following day and thus they continued coming and going day after day devouring the Ibliage and depositing their eggs At first they selected bare spots for this purpose but finally the whole surface of the earth was so broken up by their borings that every inch of ground contained several patches of eggs This visitation was spread over many hundreds of miles Of other insects eaten by man we may instance the hum ble bee whose body is often sacrificed to the love of boys for sweets who since Shakspeares time have searched for the well bestratted bees sweet bag while in Cejdon bees are eaten bodily as food Some kinds of ants are eaten ly the Indians of the Gulf coast of IMexico Sumichrast says see our Guide to the Study of Insects p 187 that the natives eat the females after having detached the tho rax and Humboldt tells us that ants are eaten by the Indians of South America Kirby speaks from his own Pacicaud experience he says that auts have no unpleasant flavor they are very agreeably acid and the taste of the trunk and abdomen is different He refers to the fact that in some parts of Sweden ants are distilled along with rye to give a flavor to tlie inferior kinds of brandy Certain galls are esteemed in Constantinople for their aromatic and acid taste and Reaumur sajs that the galls of the ground ivy have been eaten in France but he thinks it doubtful if they ever rank with good fruits Kirby Reaumur has suggested that the numbers of injurious caterpillars might be judiciously lessened by our using them as food Kirby and Spence in their admirable Introduc tion to Entomology give a list of the lepidopterous larvae eaten by man Amongst the delicacies of a Boshiesmans table Sparr man reckons tliose caterpillars from which butterflies pro ceed The Chinese who waste nothing after they have unwound the silk from the cocoons of the silkworm send the chrysalis to table they also eat the larva of a hawk moth Sphinx some of which tribe Dr Darwin tells as are in his opinion very delicious and lastl the natives of New Holland eat the caterpillars of a species of moth of a singular new genus to which my friend Alexander MacLeay Esq has assigned characters and from the circumstance of its larva coming out only in the night to feed has called it Njcterobius A species of butterfly also Eublaxi Jiamata MacLeay as we learn from Mr Bennett congregates on the insulated granitic rocks in a particular district which he visited in the months of November December and January in such countless myriads with what object is unknown that the native blacks who call them Bugong assemble from far and near to collect them and after re moving the wings and down by stirring them on the ground previously heated by a large fire and winnowing them eat the bodies or store them up for use by pounding and 28 EDIBLE IXSECTS 125 smoking them The bodies of these butterflies abound in an oil witli the taste of nuts and when first eaten produce violent vomitings and other debilitating effects but these go off after a few days and the natives then thrive and fatten exceedingly on this diet for which they nc 88 have to contend with a black crow which is also attracted by the Bugongs in groat numbers and which they despatch with their clubs and use as food Kirby Among beetles the grubs of the gigantic palm weevil are roasted and eaten by natives in the tropics and the larva of the large Prionus much like the one here figured Fig 88 is eaten at Surinam in America and in the West Indies both by whites and blacks who empty wash and roast them and find them delicious Mr Hall informs me that in Jamaica this grub is called Macauco and is in request at the principal tables A similar insect is dressed at Mauritius under the name of 3Ioutac which the whites as well as negroes eat greedily and IMr Kirb from whom I have quoted thinks with Dr Darwin that the grub of the com mon cockchafer might be added to our entremets Who will Fig 89 set the example on this side of the Atlantic of eating the common white grub or young of the May beetle Fig 89 so destructive to our strawberr beds The Cicada or harvest fly to which Anacreon inscribes an ode was eaten by the Greeks Aristotle says that the pupoD are most delicious and after they change to the winged state the males at first have the best flavor while the females are better on account of the eggs Athentieus also and Aristophanes 29 Prionus May Beetle grub 126 HALF HOURS WITH IXSECTS mention their being eaten and lian is extremely angry with the men of his age tliat an animal sacred to the muses should be strung sold and eagerly devoured Kirby from whom we quote cites Peter Collinson as saying that the winged form of the seventeen year Cicada was in his time 1763 eaten by the Indians of North America Lastly the gravid enormously distended female of the white ant is regarded as a delicious morsel by the Hottentots and Smeathman thought them delicate nourishing and wliole some being sweeter than the grub of the weevil of the palms Roasted spiders are eaten by the natives of New Caledo nia Kirby says that even individuals amongst the more polished natives of Europe are recorded as having a similar taste so that if you could rise above vulgar prejudices you would in all probability find them a most delicious morsel If you require precedents Reaumur tells us of a young lady who when she walked in her grounds never saw a spider that she did not take and crack upon the spot Another female the celebrated Anna Maria Scherman used to eat them like nuts which she affirmed they much resembled in taste excusing her propensity by saying that she was born under the sign Scorpio If you wish for the authority of the learned Lalande the celebrated French astronomer was as Latreille witnesses equally fond of these delicacies Even the centipedes are not neglected as Humboldt records the fact that he has seen the Indian children drag out of the earth centipedes eighteen inches long and more than half an inch broad and devour them Even the eggs of certain insects are eaten In Mexico the eggs of the Corixa or water boatman are often used as food and in the same country the Indians prepare a liquor from the Cicindela of which we figure a species by mac erating it in water or spirit which they apparently use as a stimulating beverage Druggists are indebted to insects for the Spanish fly or blistering beetle Cimtharis for an important article in the pharmacopoeia Our native species of Cantharis Fig 90 a Lylta cinerea b L vitirina of which four are common all over the country when dry and powdered afford a good vesicant Were we living in the middle ages or even as far back as the eighteenth century our materia medica would be swelled Fig so Lytta or blistering beetle by a long list of entomological nostrums of which Kirby and Spence aflJbrd us an amusing list As we are indebted to the ant for lessons of prudence and thrift so has this humble creature given one of the gieatest boons to poor suffering humanit To the ant we are indebted for the discovery of chloroform How the dis covery of this prince of anodjncs came about Dr Lankcster tells us in his little work on the Uses of Animals p 243 Some years ago whilst editing the correspondence of John Ray I was amused by the letters which passed between this great naturaliit and Dr Martin Lister of York on the subject of the acid liquid of pismires It had been ob served that when ants were bruised their juices afforded an acid secretion Avhich substance was afterwards known as formic acid The attention of modern chemists being thus called to formic acid Dumas discovered that it contained a base a compound radical which he called formylc This 31 128 Packakd base with three atoms of oxjgen forms the formic acid Now Dumas not only made this out but he further discov ered that the three atoms of oxygen might be replaced with three atoms of chlorine He thus obtained terchloride of formyle It so happened that when etlier had been em ployed as an aniiesthetic Dr Simpson of Edinburgh was induced to look for some agent that might act even more beneficially than ether in this Iespect He tried the terchlo ride of formde and found it to succeed and this is the agent which under the name of chloroform has been the means of alleviating a vast amount of human misery and if occasionally it has destroyed life it has saved so much that mankind owes a deep debt of gratitude to those who have successfully introduced it into practice Such then are some of the relations in which insects stand to us They feed ns clothe us and lull us to sleep The gorgeous hues and lines of grace of some fill our minds with visions of beauty others master pieces of ugliness turn us to loathing They are our companions by day and alas also by night Finally a thorough comprehension of their origin structure and habits forms a part of that grand science biology which great intellects have through the centu ries since the time of Aristotle gradually and with much pains built up and the end and aim of which is to seek the answer to the question What is life thus bringing the mind of the inquirer into closer relations with the Source of all Life A HISTORY of the insect inhabitants of a pond or AA stream would deal largely in the tragic The biog raphy of one aquatic insect from the time of its birth till its death provided it completed the usual round of exis tence allotted to its species would be a long and perhaps tedious record of escapes from its enemies of its methods of avoiding or repelling their attacks while on the other hand the pages of its biograph would be largely occupied with a list of those it had killed and wounded not from the mere love of carnage but from the simple necessity of main taining its own existence If we reflect for a moment on the fact that out of about one iiundred eggs laid by the dragon fl perhaps only one pair survive the following summer and that the remaining ninetyeight 3oung have afforded food for other dragon flics and insects of other species and then consider the amount of insectfood required to maintain the pair of dragon flies from tlie larval to the winged state we shall be impressed with the fact that the majority of insects are born to serve as food for the few that survive Life among tlie lower animals as in human affairs is an intense struggle for existence resulting in a triumph of the favored few over the masses These few perpetuate the qualities which gave them success and so we have a con stant progress upwards of life from lower to higher forms a survival of those best fitted by physical and intellectual qualities to maintain themselves in the world There is genius or preeminence in intellectual qualities among in sects Ants choose generals and master workmen whose lead the follow in their wars and public works The queen bee is mistress of the kingdom over whic she rules 9 1 130 It is not however simply a record of the triumph of brute force Intelligence is everywhere guiding the operations of these unconscious or possibly conscious agents The great interest in studying the habits of insects results from this fact of the immanence of mind in the animal world Insects and animals generally are not mere animated machines with a blind instinct alone operating under the rule of socalled inflexible physical laws for these very laws as we call them are in a state of unstable equilibrium There was a time before life originated when the world was form ing by the agency of cosmical laws the biological laws became developed with the rise of animal and plant life The laws of life the processes of evolution have changed and become more complex as forms of life beginning with the Vibrios Moners and Amoebas became differentiated into the grand groups of the animal and vegetable kingdom So the life of the individual of the species of the animal world collectively is a long record of feats of strength of mere animal courage opposed to cunning skill and sagacity The strong are saved by their size and strength while on the other hand as in the parasitic species the very weakness of the weak is often their defence In past ages insects were gigantic and low in intelligence judging by their sur viving relations while the insects of the present day as a rule have smaller more compact bodies with their appen dages more under the control of their intelligence The most fitting have survived The families and orders of the Neuroptera which are least numerous at the present day are those which have succumbed in this struggle for existence The Hymenoptera and beetles comprise the most intelligent of insects and they are perhaps the most numerous in species Had one been born in the Silurian period he would be excused for being a materialist of the Biichner school but man of the Quaternary period ie of the present day who 2 Packaro insects of THE POND AND STREAM 131 is able to reflect on this progress of life as the beneficent result of the struggle mental and physical for existence of his own and other species such an one unless his faculties are quite unequally developed cannot avoid a rational com bination of materialism and spiritualism in his intellectual makeup The very faculty he possesses of making this retrospect and studying his own mental operations and of appreciating the Infinite Power working in material laws separates him from the animals and should teach him that he is not subject alone to physical material laws So if in looking back the picture of the animal world evolving from a mere drop of protoplasm of humanity struggling up from some apelike Fig 91 form seems sad tragic and gives a shock to the sensibilities of many the final result is liopeful and inspir ing In connection with tliese pro found problems of our own existence the study of the halits economy structure and embryology of animals their various contrivances for the maintenance of life their evident en jojment of life as long as it lasts the gleams of intellect flashing out in their daily acts all derive a fresh and startling interest Among aquatic insects there are marvels of mechanical skill displayed in the construction of the bodies of tiie swim ming and diving forms The Gerris or Wherrjman Fig 91 of our streams ages ago anticipated our racing boats and wherries Our diving macliines whether known to their inventors or not are modelled on the principle of the diving beetle and the diving spider Tlie mechanism of swimming in the Dytiscus engaged the attention of StrausDurchheim the famous French anatomist Models of scissors straight and curved that would give new ideas to a Sheffield mnnu 3 132 HALF HOUKS WITH ENSECTS facturer may be studied in the jaws of the young of these same diving beetles The hirval Corethra a fly allied to the mosquito is an excellent areometer and other philosophical instruments have their counterparts in the special organs of insects adapting them for an aquatic life Cases of protective mimicry are afforded by the Caddis flies Fig 92 which move over the bottom carrying about with them a movable chevaux de rise of sticks behind which lurk a nimble pair of jaws or they mimic innocent sticks or build their cases of bits of moss and move about Fig 92 Different forms of Case Worms bearing as it were subaqueous Birnam forests or when their tubes are built of sand imitate the irregularities of the bottom over which they creep and thus living in ambush all the while are protected in their turn by these disguises As the Ranatra Fig 93 is noticed moving about slowly at the bottom of a pool it would be easily mistaken for an ear of wheat moved accidentally It is not so harmless as it looks for its fore legs are held up in an attitude that will at least be deemed by its victims a striking one When it strikes out those legs the long claws close with a firm grasp ESTSECTS OP THE POND AND STREAM 133 on the struggling worm which is nailed to the leg by a spine opposite the end of the claw Why its bod is so long and linear in shape we cannot imagine unless for the purpose of concealment and protection as its movements are labored and slow as are those of Belostoma its near ally which as Fig 93 Ilanatra has been remarked by others closely resembles a dead loaf as it lies at the bottom of the pond in wait for its prey So small a proportion of insects arc aquatic that the question arises whether those that do live in our ponds and streams may not be the descendants of terrestrial forms The ocean is the parent of all life ultimately but only a very few insects live in salt water and it is easy to see that a maritime life is not a normal one to them So in a less degree with the fresh water forms The aquatic insects are representatives of scattered families and though all are in various ways modified by their aquatic surroundings 3et so much do they differ in their modes of development and structure among themselves that it is easy to see that they belong mainly to terrestrial types which have adopted an aquatic life after the t3pe to Avhich they had belonged had become fixedly terrestrial For example many beetles ¥lG 94 Fia 95 Fig 90 Dytiscus A Carabid Amphizoa which are aquatic are allied to the carnivorous ground beetles The Dytiscus and its allies are essentially aquatic Carabidfe the family comprising the ground beetles The larvffi of these water beetles have the same kind of feelers and mouthparts as the land Carabids the structure of the adult beetle is on the Carabid type the body being how ever more ovate and modified for swimming Both types Figs 94 and 95 may have been derived from ancestors of terrestrial habits As proof of this we have the Cali fornian Amphizoa Fig 96 which is said by Dr Horn to 6 INSECTS OF THE POND AND STREAM 135 be subaquatic and in its structure and habits connects the Carabids with tlie Dytiscidre Out of the immense number of species of butterflies and moths but three or four genera are known to be aquatic The larvjB of Hydrocampa Cataclysta and Paraponyx small moths of the family of PyralidiB live in the water on the leaves of aquatic plants the caterpillar of Paraponyx being provided both with branchite and spiracles M Bar has lately discoered in French Guiana a hairy caterpillar which Fig 97 A Tardigrade lives in the water and resembles that of our Arctia or woolly bear It has no tracheal branchiae and all the spiracles except those on the segment behind the head and a pair on the end of the body are smaller than usual There uic no truly aquatic Hjmenoptera or Orthoptera The aquatic Ileniiptcra such as Gerris Notonecta a Corixa and a few other forms all breathe atmospheric air though the stigmata may be elongated and otherwise modified for the purpose One spider the Argyroneta of Europe is 7 136 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS aquatic We know of no other water spider Certain mites are aquatic but do not differ from land species in tlieir mode of respiration Tlie Tardigrades Fig 97 Macrohiotus Americanus are low microscopic mites which live in water and are called water bears They have no spiracles nor air tubes and respire solely through the skin The Pycnogo nids which live at all depths of the ocean from low water to several hundred fathoms and which are probably related to the mites also breatlie through the skin It is among the twowinged flies Diptera andNeuroptera Fig 98 Ephjdia and pupa case that we find insects with gilllike appendages penetrated by air tubes which supply fresh air to the blood There are quite a number of aquatic larvae of flies but with few excep tions such as those of the mosquito and black fl they belong to families which also contain closely allied genera which live in the earth For example most crane fly larvae are terrestrial a few are adapted for aquatic life some lar val horse flies live in mould some are known to be aquatic 8 Packakd tNTSECTS OF THE POND AND STREAM 137 most of the Syrphidae are Aphiseaters in the larval state Of that immense family MuscitUe of which the house fly is a t3pe which are almost purely terrestrial Eplndra Fig 98 fly and pupa case is aquatic It may be said on the whole that the aquatic larvie of the Diptera were originally terrestrial insects which have adopted an aquatic life and are exceptions to the rule In the Neuroptera however there are whole families which are aquatic both in the larval and pupal state having exter nal gilllike appendages in both stages and in the case of Fig 99 Pteronarcys which is closely allied to Perla Fig 99 from Figuier they are retained in the winged fly The Neurop tera arc par excellence water insects and yet it is doubtful even whether they have not originally assumed this excep tional mode of life and while the earliest of all insects were not at first terrestrial This is speculation and guesswork but facts seem to point to this conclusion Now the changes in structure fitting the insect for a life in ponds and streams are to be found in the organs of loco motion and the breathing apparatus and in this essay I 9 138 Fig 100 Trachcti shall endeavor to show how insects primarily adapted for breathing atmospheric air are enabled to breathe in the water then I shall notice the various modes of swimming in aquatic insects In the first place how are insects fitted to live under water It will be remembered that all insects breathe by means of air tubes called tracheae Fig 100 tiachea Fig 101 section of spiracle These are tubes composed of three coats the inner a tube of mucous membrane sur rounded by a spiral thread formed orig inally out of a homogeneous membrane which ultimately splits up into these spiral threads giving rigidity and toughness to the tube There is a third loose investing membrane the socalled peritoneal coat A trachea originates from a spiracle or breathing hole of which there are usually nine on each side of the body These spiracles or stigmata Fig 101 act open by a slit into an inner chamber eh guarded by a muscle m The air thus admitted is carried into every part of the body by the numerous fig loi fine subdivisions of these tubes which form a beautiful network of silvery threads when filled with air They are bathed by the blood which is everywhere oxygenated by the air in these fine tubes Numerous beetles and water bugs have no special apparatus for breathing in the water The Dytiscus when it wishes to breathe rises to the surface tail foremost bends the end of its abdomen so as to allow the air to pass into the spiracles under the eljtra and scuttles down to the bottom in great apparent haste with a bubble of air attached to the tip of the body When its supply of air is exhausted 10 Spiracle it is forced to rise for more In tlie travels of Colymbetes a near all of Dytiscus around the jar in which we have watched its movements it often makes a squeaking sound which we have heard at night as often as by day This noise can be readily produced artificially by rubbing the end of the abdomen against the elytra or wing covers In this beetle there are six pairs of abdominal spiracles but the basal pair are nearly three times as large as the others and into these most of the air probably enters In handling this beetle one is apt to be pricked by the sternal spine which extends back of the insertion of the hind legs and is as sharp as a needle How useful it may be to the insect in pusliing its way through any obstacle may be demonstrated b holding it tightly between the fingers here even it man ages to push its way out and drop to the ground All the water beetles fly about in the night exchanging one pond for another and they sometimes enter our Avindows Siebold says that Hydropliilus jnceus Fig 102 from Piguier the largest of all the water beetles and belonging to a different gronp from Dytiscus when it breathes pro trudes only its antennae out of water and bending them backwards thus establishes a communication between the external air and that adhering to the under surface of the body In our Notoneda undulata Fig 103 the mode of taking aboard its supply of air before diving is most admirable The deck of the boat ie the under side of the body for the insect swims oii its back has a longitudinal ridge in the middle a broad gutter between this ridge and the sharp edge of the bod is bridged over from the head to tlie end of the abdomen ly a layer of dark coarse oblique hairs and a layer of less obliciue hairs arises on each side from tlie middle of the ridge These hairs thus form a false upper deck Tlie creature rises to the surface the end of the body projecting slightly out of water the air passes up on each 11 140 side along the tunnel under the hairs and collects in bubbles above the base of the legs Along the bottom of this Fig 102 Hydrophilus piceus eggs and larva tunnel are six pairs of spiracles into which the air passes The air in the specimens we observed did not adhere to the hairs of the hind legs as Siebold says it does nor as he states in his Comparative Anatomy trans lated by Burnett does the air for respiration as a rule pass under the elytra since the spiracles arc not situated on the upper side of the body but on the under and quite a distance from the edge of the body Nor does this insect breathe at all as Westwood states like Dytiscus in which the spir acles are situated on the upper side of the body so that the air enters readily under the elytra When it takes in the air the tip of the abdomen is thrust up just above 12 Notonecta water and an orifice is formed by the separation of the liairs at the end of the keel Avhich form the larger part of the mouth of the orifice the remainder being composed of the hairs fringing the movable terminal plates of the body The air thus passes in between the false deck of hairs and the under side of the body When the insect is taken out of the water the hairs cling to the sides of the body reveal ing very distinctly the breathing holes Some air occasion ally penetrates under the elytra and remains there most of the time Often the whole under side of the bod between the pairs of legs is a continuous bubble like a mass of quick silver or molten lead The Notonccta often rises for a new supply of air before the old is exhausted While handling Notouecta thoughtless of its reputed sting in a quiet businesslike way it inserted its beak in my thumb the pain almost as severe as the p sting of a Avasp and lasting for five minutes The pain was too acute and benumbing not to be the elTect of a poison If no poison sac will yet be found in the head then the saliva must be an acrid poison By this poisonous sting it must para lyze its victims Another water bug the Co rixa Fig 104 enlarged is less tame and does not come to the surface nearly as often as Notonccta It receives its suppl of air in an instant and darts down to the bottom It does not swim in an inverted position It takes in the air so suddenly that it is impos sible without long and patient observation to see the mode which we have been unable to find described It rises to the surface in a horizontal position and no sooner is the sur face reached than it darts to the bottom and in one instance 13 Corixa 142 L remained there for ten minutes by the watch and then darted up again leaving an air bubble in its wake which rose to the top afterwards It carries down with it a broad silvery streak along the side of the bol3 The air is really introduced under the head and front thorax The head is large and very movable as well as the prothorax It slides back and forth on a tliin membrane from the surface of which it can be raised So with the hinder edge of the pro thorax which rides over the membranous hind thorax which it nearly conceals When the Corixa rises to the surface it floats in a horizontal position the hind edge of the head and the prothorax rising slightly above the surface Now slightly raising the back of the head and the hind edge of the prothorax a space appears in front of and behind the prothorax by which tlie air passes into the breathing holes beneath This is proved by the small bubbles of air re maining in these two cracks Two minute spiracles may be detected in deep pits one on each side just above the inser tion of the legs and from which the trachcce arise each one dividing into three irregular short branches as may be seen by detaching the segment and holding it up to tlie light So much for tliose insects which simply rise to tlic surface and take in air without any special modification of the spir acles We now come to a second group of adult insects which by a change in the number position and form of the spiracles are provided with a special respiratory contrivance A striking example is seen in Ranatra the water stick bug The end of this creatures body terminates in two thin tubes nearly as long as the insect itself at the end of which are two spiracles each connecting with a trachea These lono appendages which are simply elongated spiracles it thrusts out of the water takes in its supply of air and then goes on in its deliberate ramble The Nepa of Europe has much shorter respirator3 tubes than Ranatra while those of Belos toma scarcely project beyond the body though in B annec 14 PACKAun INSECTS OF THE POXD AND STREAM 143 tens from Nicaragua the are a quarter of fin inch long and two tracheal branches can be distinctly seen in each of them The other abdominal spiracles are wanting in these three forms though thiee pairs according to Schiodte are present on the thorax There are a number of aquatic larvse which breathe by similar respiratory tubes Such is the young of Dytiscus Eristalis larva Fig 107 Dytisous larva Mcrodon and larva It has to rise to the surface for air which is inspired through the bristlelike tubes at the end of Ihe body So with the larval Eristalis Fig 106 and its ally Merodon hardus ¥g Q1 a larva and Ilelophilus Fig lOS These maggots frequent the most loathsome ditches thick with mud and putref3ing matter Here they lie acting as scavengers and doing all they can to aid the State Board of Health They wave their long flexible respiratory tubes aloft and drink in the pure air of heaven not unmixed per haps with the less than spicy odors emanating from their native puddle Some of the Ilelophili frequent strongly brackish water in fact almost purely salt water while 1Epliydia with its rather short thick tubes and fleshy feet clambers over green sea weeds in salt pools removed above the reach of ordinary tides or lives in the brine pools of Illinois or the salt lakes of the West The aquatic larva of one of the Tipulids or crane flies Ptychoptera has a long respiratory tube while in the pupa there is one attached to the head and much longer proportionally than in the lar val Helophilus Among those larval flies which are obliged to ascend to the surface to breathe is the young Mosquito Fig 109 a Fig 108 Helophilus larvae after Figiiier larva b pupa a paddles at end of body of pupa Its body is beautifully adapted for going through its aquatic evolutions The head and thorax are so large and bulky that it cannot ascend and lie motionless in a horizontal position as in the young Anopheles which lies before us in a dish as we are writing but it hangs head downwards and breathes by means of a spiracle lodged in one of the large tubes into which the end of the body subdivides the position of this tube being maintained bj a pencil of radiating hairs attached to a shorter projection at the end of the bod The air is rapidly absorbed b the unusually large trachea nearly filling the longer tube After taking a fresh breath it often swings its head around mouth upwards its tail being the pivot mowing the surface of the water if clouded with decaying matter with its jaws The young Anopheles the fly of which is the fourspotted mosquito found in houses late in autumn and early in spring is a surface breather But the head and thorax are scarcely heavier than the hind body and along its whole length are tufts of hairs which spread out and act as floats to the body The mouthparts are tufted more distinctly than in the Fig 109 A B Mosquito larva and pupa young mosquito In this larva the lody ends in four flesh fingerlike appendages in wliich the tracheae may be dis tinctl seen In its pupal stage the mosquito is quite a different being Its life is regulated by a new code It scorns food of all sorts and like some religious devotee lives ou air alone and that in homeopathic doses The enormous thorax is almost a deformity and now instead of breathing through its tail it bears two clubshaped respiratory tubes on its back Fig 109 I These are situated on the site of the future tho racic spiracles of the fly Of those insects whicb extract air from the water in which they live and are not obliged to ascend to the surface is the young of the plumed gnat Fig 110 CJdronomus oceanicus male and beneath head of female a larva and head en larged These worms are very abundant in every mud puddle but the species here figured lives at all depths in Fig 110 Ocean Gnat a larva and head enlarged the sea down to over a hundred feet Some larvte of an other species were dredged in Lake Superior by Mr S I Smith at a depth of one hundred and fiftyfive feet They are usually provided with two pairs of fleshy filaments perme ated by one or two slender tracheal twigs connecting with a slender pair of tracheae running through the body and enlarging towards the head So slightly developed how ever is the tracheal system in Chironomns and so thin are the walls of the body that I am inclined to think that these nearl transparent larvae breathe in part through their skin Now we have in the singular ghostlike larva of Corethra another plumed gnat a being which has no spiracles nor tra cheae and which breathes as NYeissmann sajs through the skin The air thus absorbed is contained in four reservoirs forming swimming bladders and thus the density of the water is measured by this living hydrostatic apparatus Two of these kidneyshaped bladders are lodged in the tho rax and are larger than the two near the end in order to support the heavier front end of the worm These singular larvie may be found in winter in ponds by breaking through the ice as well as the Belostoma and various water beetles and can be kept alive in jars of water The fingerlike appendages we have described in the larva of the plumed gnat afford the simplest form of tracheal gill Did the blood penetrate into them and accompany in closed vessels the air tube it would be exactly comparable with the gills of fishes and larval amphibious reptiles but it does not it is not a true gill and the term false gill or tracheal gill has been applied to this organ From the young Chironomus with its four tracheal finger shaped gills attached to the extreme end of the bodj we may pass to a singular larva of a European crane fly called Cylindrotoma which according to DeGeer breathes by means of numerous hollow flexible filaments scattered over the body and which as Westwood says appear to be traversed by trachcic A similar looking creature is the caterpillar of Paraponyx which respires under water by means of a number of fasciculate filaments situated on the sides of the abdominal rings In fact this caterpillar has been anticipjited by the case worms the young of the Caddis flies in which the caterpil 19 148 Fig 111 larlike body is provided with white slender filaments aris ing in groups of from two to five and crossing over the back of the worm When the case worms are about to transform they close up the mouth of their case with a grating or as in the snaillike caseworm Helicopsyche wliose case Fig Ill is made of grains of sand they close the aperture by a dense silken lid pierced by a slit through which the water enters The only exception known to this mode of respiration in the large family of Caddis flies is Enoicyla which is terrestrial living in moss at the roots of trees and consequently has no respiratory Fig 112 Nemoura and pupa filaments Notwithstanding the submerged life of these case worms they are attacked by ichneumon flies when in the larval state How the young ichneumon lives in the submerged body of its host is not known The branchial gills in the Perla and its allies Nemoura Fig 112 and pupa and Pteronarcys etc which are flat bodied insects living under stones in streams have been in vestigated by Newport the famous English anatomist and quite recently by Dr Gerstaecker of Berlin Mr Newport made the astonishing discovery that the Avinged adult Pteronarcbjs retains its larval tracheal gills and Dr Gerstaecker has lately liscovered that this is also the case with a species of Dianiphipnoa from Chili and a European species of Ne moura This is analogous to certain Tritons or Salamanders which retain their gills in adult life The larva of Ilydrophilus the large water beetle Fig 102 breathes by means of spiracles but is probably aided by the lateral filaments along the abdomen One would hardly suspect that the whirligig beetle which gyrates almost unceasingly on the surface of everj roadside puddle or eddy of the stream had 3oung of such a singular appearance They differ from all known coleopterous larvae in the posses sion of eight pairs of large long thick hair appendages permeated by tracheae They would by some be mistaken for caddis worms but their head is much larger and jaws much longer and sickleshaped In August the mature larvae are said to creep out of the water and spin an oval cocoon at tached to some plant and then dropping their tracheal gills witli their larval skins lreathe through siiraclcs After remaining a month in the upa state it appears as a beetle which lays its eggs in regular rows on the leaves of water plants and in about a week after tlie larvre are hatched An interesting chapter might be written on the sense of sight in aquatic insects In Notonecta and Corixa the eyes pass under the water level so that they can see above and below at the same time So with Gyrinus Fig 113 Its eyes are divided by the portion of the head that carries the antennae so that as Wood says the portion under the sur face may be compared with a water glass used by fishermen for observing objects at the bottom Our Gyrinus larva repeats with great exactitude the form of the young Cory 21 Gyrinus and larva 150 Fig 114 dalns Fig 114 which transforms into the large netveined insect Fig 115 so formidable in appearance and yet so harmless A singular chapter in biology would be the life of this insect The gigantic carnivorous larva with its large head and enor mous jaws is provided with eight pairs of long rather stiff respiratory filaments Dr Ilagen has called attention to the spiracles of this crea ture which are not usu ally present with tracheal gills and to the reason for their existence It seems that like the Euro pean Sialis Fig 116 larva and pupa it lives some weeks out of water before its transformation into the pupa which rests in an earthen co coon in the banks of streams above water The eggs Fig 114 a are very large and are deposited In a squarish mass on the steins of water plants There is no more beau Corydalus larva and egg tifnl object for low powers of the microscope than the larval May fly Fig 117 The body is so transparent that the movements of the heart the play of its valves the circula tion of the blood the distribution of the tracheae the diges tive canal and its movements as well as the action of the 22 IXSECTS OF THE POND AND STREAM 151 muscles controlling the jaws and other parts of the mouth can all be watched with ease The tra cheal gills like pad dles either round or long and leaflike are arranged in pairs along the hinder re gion of the body and the tracheae in them can be readily seen These beauti ful respiratory leaves are also paddles and by their aid as well as by the undulations of the body the 3oung May fly moves rap idly and gracefully through the water It lives two years while tbe winged fly Fig 118 but a day rarely over twenty four hours The winged fly throws off the pupa skin in an instant While holding a pupa in my hands the im ago slipped out sud denly with wings fully formed This Fig 115 The Horned Corydulus was the socalled subimago after a few hours if it had not been placed in the collecting bottle it would have thrown off a thin pellicle and then been sexuall mature It then Fig 116 Fig 117 Fig lis Larva and Pupa of Sialis Larva of Palingenia May Fly las its eggs in a round mass and dies Some of the larvae live in burrows at the bottom of ponds while others swim free Coming lastly to the family of Dragon flies we find among the larvae the most diverse means of respiration In the young of Agrion Fig 119 a respiratory leaf of larva the body ends in three large leaves through the middle of which runs a trachea which sends off a number of smaller branches These larvai when quite small are beautiful objects for the microscope their bodies then are so transpar ent Now iu the young of the larger dragon flies such as Diplax Cordulia Fig 120 iEschna Fig 121 and Ma croinia Fig 122 the breathing process is carried on within the body The terminal portion of the di gestive tract is provided with ridges of mucous mem brane Into these folds or ridges numerous tracheal twigs penetrate Fig 123 x The water is admitted through the conical valves at the end of the body there it is deprived of its air which is absorbed by the trachea and ejected in a gentle stream or if the Agnon anl Kespimtovy Leaf of Larva creature is startled it is driven out as if by a force pump Fig 120 or syringe sending the insect forward several times its own length Returning again to the Ma flies Walsh has described a mode of respi ration unique in that group but which reminds us of the internal lunglike apparatus of the larval dragon fl This curious form is otherwise an ex ception to all insects in that its three thoracic rings above are instead of Coidiiiia lateralis being separate consolidated into one plate which extends back halfway over the abdomen Fig 124 III shows the position of the tracheal lungs in the end of the abdomen AVe need further observations to show how the animal takes in and expels the water 25 154 No Myriopods are aquatic but a number of mites and allied forms live in water and extract the air mechanically mixed with the water without having to rise to the surface They have two spiracles and air tubes but how they extract the air in the water is not known Such are the Hydrachna and Atax which live in their early stages as parasites be tween the gills of fresh water clams while some species attach themselves to water insects Of the various modes of swimming among insects the Fig 121 Fig 122 schna Maciomia transversa simplest though not the most graceful is wriggling By a series of contortions of the body the young Chironomus moves about without much apparent purpose The twist ings and turnings of the larval mosquito are anticipations in nature of the most laborious and complicated feats in gym nastics of the circus clown The latter realizes the amount of muscular exertion and nervous strain expended in a two minutes circumtorsion of the ring The young mosquito through its life of such violent undulations knows no fatigue A study through the transparent skin of the arrangement Fig 123 of the muscles of the body shows their wonderful adapta bility for the production of these complicated movements Many aquatic insects are either side wheelers or pro pellers The larval Ephemera aided by the beautiful pad dlelike tracheal gills along the sides of the body moves through the water b a series of exceedingly grace ful undulations while the young Agriou pro pels itself partly at least by its large terminal respiratory leaves How by a strange economy of nature the dragon fly larva combines the functions of digestion locomotion and respi ration in an organ which like a force pump ejects a power ful stream and like a flash propels the creature many times its own length over the bottom of its pond we have seen above One important result of the metamorphosis of the 3oung mosquito into a pupa is that it is promoted from a wriggler to a paddler padilling being a higher mode of aquatic loco motion Our figure of the pupal mosquito shows in a rude way the two beautiful thin rounded paddles at the end of 27 DijilMx larva x mass of trachere 156 Fig 124 the body By dexterous strokes aided h a graceful but rapid bending of tlie body it seeks the surface and inspires air through its thoracic respiratory tubes In the same way it descends to the bottom The Corethra larva alters the specific gravity of its body during the course of its wriggling but as a pupa all this is changed It now resembles the mosquito pupa has exter nal thoracic respiratory tubes and well developed tracheae it loses its air bladders and swims by means of two terminal paddles like those of the mosquito We now come to the water beetles and bugs whose move ments in the water are as graceful as they are awkward on land Their whole organization bodily and psychical as thoroughly adapts them for tlie water as that of the seal or whale for tlie same element They are the Amphibia of the insect world Born as sailors they take to the water on being hatched and there remain through their lives only leaving one pond to seek another im pelled by a restless love of change which unconsciously to tliemselves results in good to their race preventing too close inandin breeding and the conse quent deterioration of the stock Look at the body of the Djtiscus Fig 125 so perfectly adapted for its aquatic life Remember that it is in reality a modified ground bee tle such as Harpalus the mouthparts much the same and that the changes in form are mostly if not whoU such as adapt it to its aquatic life Tlie body is oval both ends alike as in a boat while the legs are perfect oars The hind legs instead of being broad and spiny towards the claws as in the running ground beetles taper to a point and are articulated by an exquisite mecliauism to tlie body They are edged on tlie inner side witli a dense long fringe of exceedingly fine white hairs forming with the flattened leg itself the blade of the oar and thus by a series of rapid strokes the body is propelled onwards The fore legs are short and thick and in the males modified into a clasp ing organ the three basal joints of the tarsus being broadly dilated and consolidated into a large disk covered with many minute funnelshaped suckers two or three of which are much larger than the others The Grinus is less a Fig 125 Male and Female Dytiscu3 diver than a surface swimmer It is a very sociable insect forming little swimming parties on the surface of the water In the course of its gyrations it manages to pick up a com fortable livelihood of small beetles and flies which fall into the water When disturbed it dives to the bottom Unlike the other water beetles it has very large fore legs and re markably short middle and hind legs and Hies about in the night at daylight slipping quietly into some pool On being handled it emits a disagreeable whitish milky fluid which is probably distasteful to its enemies All the other 2 J 158 water beetles so far as we have observed secrete a similar fluid but in less abundance Equally if not more perfect in its adaptability to aquatic life is the Notonecta which as its name implies swims on its back Now look at the form of the body The back usually broad and flat in the Hemiptera is here rounded like the keel of a canoe while the under side is flat forming the deck of the boat to which the oars are attached by a set of automatic rowlocks The head is bent over and submerged in front the eyes are partly above and partly beneath the water so that a double outlook into two worlds is secured The antenuje are tucked away out of sight in a groove under the eyes The end of the body is pointed affording no re sistance to the water and Fig 126 the posterior half of the body is fringed with long spreading hairs which aid in buoying the body up The adjoining cut 12G gives an idea of the atti tude of the Notonecta xotonecta when at rest at the sur face of the water back downwards The hind feet are beautifully fringed and while swimming it feathers its oars the hairs of the blade being pressed to the leg as it is drawn forwards and again spreading out with the backward stroke of the limb In this insect as well as in Corixa as Schiodte observes the hind legs are moved both together as in Dytis cus In Belostoma and probably Ranatra they are moved alternately When about to fly from its pool which it does by day as well as by night as is the case with Corixa it dives a little way down and then leaps suddenly straight up out of the water and spreads its wings flying rapidly off All the water bugs and beetles are careful to keep them selves clean and smooth Particularly necessary is it for  the Notonocta to keep its keel smooth and it may often be seen brusliing its back with its hind legs or wliere the will not suffice using the middle and front legs for this purpose It la3s its long cylindrical eggs on the stems and leaves of plants The 3oung hatch in about fifteen das appearing in spring The differ from their parent chiefly in wanting wings Corixa is in its form more like the slow moving punt being rounded nearly alike at both ends The head is still more bent and prolonged beneath partly overlapping the thorax Its beak is minute and hidden from sight So much for the swimming insects of which we have men tioned the principal forms There are a few of what may be called sJcaters They move like the AYherryman or Gerris on the surface of the water their feet being so constructed as to enable them to run upon the surface without wetting them The middle pair of feet are longer than the hinder and they mostly perform the work of skating being covered with fine hairs which repel the water and thus the insect skims over the surface with great rapidity making very short twists and turns like a practised skater The under side of the body is covered with short hairs like plush form ing a repellent surface to the water The fore limbs are much shorter and used at times in re taining their prey Some of these Whcrrymen will be found minus the hind wings and are condemned to a life of com parative seclusion though it is said that the winged indi viduals seldom take flight Far out in mid ocean in the tropics are found the oceanic waterskaters the Ilylobatos Their fore legs are short outstretched with thickened thighs They are also wing less the wingcovers alone being present They course over the surface of tiie ocean in large swarms and are seen from vessels many hundred miles from land They are the true toilers of the sea among insects 31 160 The only possible way to study the aquatic insects is to keep them in glass jars and bowls where their habits can be carefully studied An aquarium may thus be improvised which will last for several weeks without care though it is better to add a few water plants such as the water cress the Valisneria Callitriche Duckweed and other plants to keep the water ox3genated By stocking the aquarium with the larvoe and pupse of certain neuropterous insects at the time when the Avinged forms are most abundant the immature forms can easily be kept long enough for us to determine the winged species into which they pass In the autumn as cold weather and short days keep us indoors much profit and solid amusement may be gained by these studies of pond life within the house Even in winter after the snow is on the ground one can break through the ice of roadside ponds and with a small net capture nearly all the insects we have spoken of in this number and keep watch upon their habits and study their anatomy with the aid of the needle and lens He can also turn to the lower forms such as the water fleas rotifers infusoria and rhizopods with which the waters teem winter and summer and find with a few dips of tlie net material for weeks of observation and study 32 THE POPULATION OF AN APPLE TEEE IGl 7 The Jfopulatmn of an JJpple Tree A FRENCH author has written a very pleasant little book entitled the Population of a Pear Tree Of the population of an apple tree a ponderous tome could be written but in this essay on the insects injuring this facile princeps of our fruit trees we shall confine our selves mainly to the more injuiious kinds giving a brief and condensed account of the most important species About seventyfive species in all are known to prey upon the apple tree We may first consider those kinds found PREYING UPON THE ROOTS TJie Pear Blight or Eriosoma ivjri Fig 127 a the gall 6 larva c female c leg e beak antenna of female Fig 127 Blight Insect 7 of larva after Riley sometimes causes a good deal of disturbance to the health of the tree lessening the vigor of its growth and causing the leaves to turn of a paler and more yellowish hue than usual If there is no borer under  the bark nor any other apparent cause and if it be a young tree it may be found on removing the soil from tlie roots that a number of galllike excrescences sometimes a couple of inches in diameter are attached to them On opening the galls a number of small wingless plant lice with larger winged ones will be observed in the crevices Their bodies are covered with a woolly exudation whence their common name woolly blight Dr Fitch who has given us the best account of this anno3dng blight insect says that the parent insect at the end of autumn works her way down along the side of the root there depositing her stock of eggs and then the grand aim of her life accomplished she dies When the ground becomes warm in spring the 3oung appear and forthwith plunge their beaks into the bark The beak thus inserted acts like a seton in the flesh of an ani mal and keeps up a constant irritation An abnormal cellgrowth sets in bringing about a permanent enlargement which undermines the health of the tree It is especially injurious in nurseries of young trees Dr Fitch wisely recommends that when the tree is found to be infested it should not be thrown away but the roots should be dipped in soap suds and when replanted a shovel ful of ashes should be mixed with the dirt This insect is a near ally of the famous Phylloxera of the vine Another insect not usually suspected of injuring the apple by suckiuG the sai of the Fig 128 j o i roots is the 3oung of the Ci cada Fig 128 enlarged which lives for sixteen 3ears sucking the roots usually of the oak but is sometimes Young Cicada attack the roots of the apple It may be imagined that sixteen years drainage of the sap of the tree is a pretty serious matter The vouno insect lives a foot or two beneath the surface of the JO 2 PACKAitD THE POPULATION OF AN APPLE TPtEE 103 ground The Cicada also at times breaks off the twigs of the apple in lajing its eggs in them INFESTING THE TRUNK OP THE TREE The Apple Tree Borer It is not particular creditable to our fruit growers that the apple tree borer still maintains such a sway in our orchards and that we pa an annual tribute of trees and apples Which were its value set forth in figures would appall the orchardist The borer is the most widely extended and wholesale in its destruction of all the insects which prey upon the apple The canker worm is local and even then less injurious taking only the leaves and apples but leaving the trees So with the tent cater pillar and bud worm but the borer has almost finished its work of destruction and the tree is doomed ere we have read its deathwarrant The history of this beetle is as fol lows during the night and sometimes in the hottest da3s of the first week of July in New England and in May and June in the western states the female beetle flies around the trunk of the tree and during this period she deposits her eggs in the bark near the root of the tree How many eggs she lays at one time is not known but she deposits one agg in a place upon the bark low down at or very near the surface of the earth but when these beetles are numerous some of their eggs are placed higher up particularly in the axils where the lower limbs proceed from the trunk Fitch Aliout a fortnight after the eggs are laid the 3oung grub hatches and immediatcl begins to eat its way upwards according to Harris or downwards according to Fitch This grub is a little footless white worm with the segment next to the head large and thick and only differs in size from the fully grown worm Fig 129 pupa c beetle after Ililey Says Dr Fitch If the outer dark colored surface of the bark be scraped off with a knife the last of August or forepart of September so as to expose tlie clean 3 164 white bark beneath as can easily be done without any injury to the tree wherever there is a joung worm it can easily be detected A little blackish spot rather larger than a kernel of wheat will be discovered wherever an egg has been de posited and by cutting slightly into the bark the worm will be found It gradually works its way onwards through the bark increasing in size as it advances until it reaches the sapwood here it takes up its abode feeding upon and con suming the soft wood hereby forming a smooth round flat cavity the size of a dollar or larger immediately under the bark It keeps its burrow clean by pushing its excrement out of a small crevice or opening through the bark which it Fig 129 Apple Tree Borer makes at the lower part of its burrow and if this orifice becomes clogged up it opens another This excrement resembles new fine sawdust and enables us readily to de tect the presence of tlie worm by the little heap of this substance which is accumulated on the ground commonly covering the hole out of which it is extruded and by par ticles of it which adhere around the orifice when it is higher up or in the fork of the tree the outer surface of the bark also often becomes slightly depressed or flattened over this cavity When half grown it sinks into the solid heart wood of the tree and obliterates the flat cell filling it up with its casting1G5 and lives in a cylindrical hole it then ceases to eject its castings simply pushing them behind it According to Riley it is within a few da3s of three years old before it is ready to change to a pupa instead of two as generallj stated Before it becomes fully grown it leaves the heart of the tree and makes its way to the bark just beneath which it transforms making a rude cocoon of chips eight or ten inches from its starting point It pupates late in the spring in May and appears in June and early in July The beetle Fig 129 c is a brown beetle with long antennas with two distinct white stripes Its primitive home is the June berry and mountain ash while it also infests the haw thorne wild apple the quince and sometimes the pear Having become acquainted with the habits of the insect we are prepared to deal in an intelligent way with it When the tree is found to be badly infested the readiest way is to cut the worms out or pour in boiling water In the autumn the bark should be carefully examined and the young worms be dug out The best preventive measure is to apply soap to the trunks of young trees in June or in May in the western states and surround the trunks with tarred paper This will baffle the beetle in laying her eggs The Buprestid Borers Two beetles of this family infest the trunk of tlie apple in their larval stage They have hard bodies with a rough exterior fjg 130 and have the power of snapping up in the air when placed on their backs The most common is Chrysohothris femorata Fig 130 natural size a larva The grub is much flattened behind the liead forming a rounded expansion behind which the bod is Chrysobothns slender and cylindrical This is the characteristic form of the larvie of this extensive group of borers The grub lives a year under the bark of the apple and oak The beetle is 5 166 greenish black above with a brassy hue especially on the raised transverse spots It may be seen from May until July sunning itself on the bark of the trees in the crevices of which it inserts its eggs As in the common borer just described it gnaws its way into the heart of the tree but it only lives over one summer From the flattened form of its body it makes a broad flat and not a cdindrical hole like that of the common borer the gallery a little over an inch in length leading upwards from where the young larva began to work A very similar species C Harrisli or Harris apple borer is sometimes very destructive to the apple though the red maple seems to have been its original home The same remedies should be applied in dealing with these borers as with the young of the striped beetle The rvJdteUned Psenocerus Though this beetle in the larva state is more commonly found tunnelling the stems of currant bushes and sometimes boring into arane Fig 131 o I stems yet it has been known to be injurious in apple orchards The beetle is a lougicoru witli a very round cylindrical body It is dark red dishbrown with a swelling at the base of the wingcovers an oblique yellowish white line on the basal third and a broad curved white line on the outer third of the Avingcover Tlie arub Psenocerus Fig 131 enlarged about three times is nearly half an inch in length with a honey jellow head scarcely half as wide as the bod while the segments of the body are rather convex each having two rows of minute warts It devours the sap wood and inner portion of the bark and also the pith of the branches thus locally killing the termi nal twigs and causing the bark to shrivel and peel oflf leaving a distinct dead line Each grub lives in a burrow about an inch and a half long and five such burrows occur in a portion of the branch five inches long The grubs lie come fully grown during the middle of August Dr Fitch says that about the first of June the female deposits her eggs The grubs change to chr3salides early in the spring and in New York the beetles appear earlj in May The Cylindrical Bark Borer or Tomicics maU produces a disease like fireblight causing the bark to shrivel and peel off and killing the branches Dr Fitch states that young thrift trees when attacked by this beetle soon after putting forth their leaves in the spring suddenly wither as though scorched by fire the bark becoming loosened from the wood and soon after numerous perforations like pin holes appear revealing the secret of the sudden destruction befalliug the tree All these bark boring beetles have a common form that of a C3linder squarely docked at the end looking as though they had been made by the inch and then cut up into lengths of about a line each The body is cov pjq 132 ered over with fine hairs so that it acts as a brush like those used for cleaning lamp chim neys The end of the body is sometimes scooped out like a gouge so that the little beetle can shovel out the dirt from its house in a true Mile sian fashion The use of the hairs undoubtedly is seen when the insect lajs its eggs The female Toinicus beetle tunnels a hole in the bark and makes little notches at intervals in which it deposits an egg On her returu by means of the short stiflT hairs projecting from her bod she brushes the dirt into the little notches thus covering up and protecting her eggs Figure 132 represents the Tomicus XTjlofjraphits enlarged several times Tills is a timber beetle and there are several allied forms but all are much like the apple bark borer It seems from the observations of JM Ferris as quoted by Dr Fitch that tlie bark boriug beetles ie those infesting fruit trees differ from the timber lcetles in an interesting peculiarity In the bark beetles there is a division of labor the males doing most of the work There are commonly several males in company with Ijut 7 168 HALF HOUES WITH INSECTS Packakd one female and the former appear to perform the chief part of the labor in the excavation of their galleries With the timber beetles on the other hand the females are much the more numerous and probably mine their galleries without any assistance from the other sex M Ferris states of one of the species that upwards of fifty females were met with in the burrows they had excavated without a single male being found there As the young hatch out they run galleries either at right angles to the original one or branching out in every direc tion though never intercrossing In this way those that confine themselves entirely to the sap wood and inner bark loosen it interrupt the circulation of sap and kill the branch affected The Apple Tivig Borer or AmpMcerus bicaudatus Fig 133 is an exceedingly annoying beetle in the middle and Fig in3 western states It somewhat resembles the bark boring beetles but belongs to a different family The grub is not known with certainty to burrow in the apple but the beetles late in the summer bore into the twigs of the apple beginning ac Amphiceius cording to Rile just above a bud or fork whence it bores downwards an inch and a half into the twig usually in wood of the previous jears growth Both the male and female beetles bore these holes and may always be found in them head downwards during the winter and spring months The holes are made for food and protection and not for breeding purposes As a preventive measure the infested twigs should be cut off and burned the trees being looked over in the autumn The PricMy Leptostylus is the last borer which we have on our list of boring beetles Dr Fitch says that the grubs are like the young of the apple tree borer and sometimes occur in multitudes under tlie bark forming long narrow winding tracks upon the outer surface of the wood these THE POPULATION OF AN APPLE TPEE 169 tracks becoming broader as the worm has increased in size The beetle appears late in August in New York It is a brown beetle its wingcovers prickly whence the name Lep tostyhis acuhfenis and with a white curAed or Vsliaped band behind the middle of the wingcovers and a black streak on their hind edge It is about a third of an inch long The Apple LeiojJus Fig 134 is a new comer in our or chards having lately been found in all its stages of growth Fig 134 Fig 135 Apple Leiopus Leiopus of Prickly Ash in the rotten limbs The grub is so closely allied to that of another species Leiopus xanthoxyli Fig 135 beetle 13G a larva h head yiq i30 seen from above and c seen from beneath that a woodcut draw ing will answer for both It differs mainly in hav ing a smaller head and a slenderer body It seems from what little we know of the halits of these insects that there is probably but Larva of Leiopus xantloxyli one brood of beetles a 3car and that they fly about and lay their eggs on the bark of the tree late in June and probably 9 170 HALF HOUES WITH INSECTS during July Upon hatching the young larvae boie in under the bark and become fully grown in the autumn spending the winter under the bark probably both in the fig i37 larva and pupa states the beetles appearing during midsummer The Scale Insect Mytilaspis pomonim Bouche or Aspicliotiis conchiformis of different authors Fig 137 This next to the borer is by far the most prevalent and destructive enemy of the apple tree The scale surrounds the body of the female while the male is twowinged and flies about ac tively It closely resembles the Pine scale insect figured on page 39 The female lays her eggs Fig 138 1 in August under the scale protecting her body and the young 2 hatch out in June when they may be found running over the bark By the middle or last of the month they become anchored by their long hairlike beak and the Sie insect day after as Riley states a white waxy secretion begins to issue from the body as seen in 3 During a period from the 6th to the middle of July the larva loses Fig 138 Apple Scale Insect its legs and feelers and assumes the form of the adult female 5 Soon after the insect moults and its cast skin remains attached to tbe insect as at 4 By the first of August the growth of the scale insect is completed and it has the appearance of an ojster shell as seen at 7 By the middle of August in the western states where Mr Riley studied its habits the female lays her eggs which do not hatch till the following June It will be seen that the best method of warding off the attacks of this pest is to thorouglily scrape the bark of the tree in the early autumn and again in the beginning of June when the 3oang are swarming over tlie surface of the bark At this time the bark should be washed with whale oil soap But it is to the natural insect parasite when reared and set loose in the orchard that we are to look for the means of restraining within proper limits this insect This is the minute ichneumon fl Aphelinus figured on page 42 The majority of the insects injurious to the apple are found FEEDING ON THE LEAVES The American Tent Caterjnllar or CJisiocampa Americana is known to every farmers boy from the social habits of the caterpillar which lives protected from the hot sun or inclem ency of the weather under a broad tent of white silk Not very creditably to orchardists and farmers the are a con spicuous object at the beginning of summer whether in the New Eigland Western or Middle states The caterpillar is easily recognized by its large size being about two inches in length and by the long brown hairs and bright colors of the body which is yellow with numerous fine eiinkled black lines forming low down on the sides of the body a black band with a blue spot on the side of each ring Along the middle of the back is a conspicuous white stripe It becomes full groAvn by the first or middle of June the period varying with its geographical position When about to make its cocoon it stops eating and wanders restlessly about in search of a suitable place in which to spin Under 11 172 HALP HOURS WITH INSECTS a board or overhanging piece of bark or in any nook or cranny it settles and spins in tlie course of a day or two a dense white cocoon often of a yellowish color which is much like that of the common Chinese silk worm except that it is more pointed at the ends Our tent caterpillar is not a remote ally of the silk worm belonging to the same natural family The supply of silk is by no means exhausted after it spins its cocoon for if it be removed from its silk house after a few hours it surrounds itself by a fresh one and even attempts a third if compelled to by the curiosity of the ex perimenter It remains in its cocoon through the remainder of the month the moth appearing early in July when it enters our rooms with a headlong flight and dashes in a peculiar confused manner upon the table The moth is un usually thickbodied and hairy It is reddishbrown with two oblique dirty white lines on the fore wings and ex pands about an inch and a quarter The female immediately lays her eggs in a mass of three or four hundred standing up side by side around a twig and covered by a gummy secretion These bunches of eggs form conspicuous objects and it is easy to pick them off after the leaves have fallen Before the winter opens the embryo caterpillars are formed and lie in the egg shell all ready to hatch In the spring they hatch out just as the leaves are beginning to unfold and it is curious to watch the habits of the young caterpillais as they gather in colonies and gradu ally spin a silken tent in a fork of the branch They lay down silken paths in every direction over the branches over which they travel back and forth their journeys becom ing longer as the leaves disappear before their ravenous jaws They work in the forenoon and afternoon in pleas sant days taking a siesta at noon or in stormy weather huddle up together upon or under their silken canop This caterpillar so large and conspicuous is easily dealt with as the nests can be easily removed by a brush or mop dipped 12 Tackvrd the POPULATIOISr OF AN APPLE TREE 173 in strong soap suds or a weak solution of coal oil or carbolic acid The original home of this moth is the wild cherry An other closely allied species sometimes found on the apple for which it deserts its favorite foodtree the oak is the Forest tent caterpillar It differs from the other species in having a row of spots along the back instead of a continuous line The moth differs in the wings being more pointed at the apex and in the transverse lines being rust brown Not only do certain carnivorous beetles and a parasitic fly Tachina prey upon the caterpillar but we have also found a small chalcid fly lurking under the mass of eggs in which it was undoubtedly parasitic TJie Canker Worm The traveller through eastern Mas sachusetts particularly in the neighborhood of Boston is often struck during the early weeks of June by the desolate appearance of the orchards which look as if a fire had passed through them There is not a green thing on the trees but all the branches are hung with a multitude of skeleton ized leaves rusty sere and fluttering feebly in the breeze This is not the work of fire but an evidence of the industry of the canker worm This scene has been repeated ever since the apple has been raised or at least for a century and is liable to be repeated for a hundred years to come unless a law is enacted to compel negligent farmers and gardeners to properly protect their trees When the buds of the apple leaves are opening we shall on careful examination find a few little dark worms scarcely thicker than a horse hair nibbling the exposed edges of the opening leaves Before people are aware of it these tiny caterpillars become nearly an inch long and defoliate the tree One can stand near the tree and hoar the nibbling of thousands of little teeth No one attempts to arrest tlic progress of the de stroers and their advent is looked upon with disma min gled however with a large proportion of fatalism No one 13 174 HxLF HOURS WITH rNSECTS seems to attempt to remove them The loss of the leaves does not kill the trees but prevents the growth of any apples When these canker worms are fully grown ie about four or five weeks after they are hatched between the 17th and 27th of June about Boston they will be found to vary exceedingly in color some individuals being blackish others greenishyellow The average style of coloration is an ash color on the back beneath yellowish with a black stripe on the sides It has a less number of feet than most caterpillars which gives it a halting looping gait as if carefully measuring the ground over which it is walking hence the name geometer Deserting its tree top it either creeps down tlie trunk of the tree or lets itself down after the manner of most caterpillars by means of a silken thread spun from a little opening in its under lip It doesnt wan der about but immediately burrows from two to six inches in the loose soil under the tree and then forms a rude loose earthen cocoon fastening the particles of dirt together with silk Twentfour hours after the cocoon is finished the worm changes to a chrjsalis which is rather pointed in front and light brown in color Here the insect remains until after the October frosts when on warm days between the cold snaps late in October and in November and December and even in some exception all warm days during the rest of the winter the adult insects come forth Nature has endowed the sexes quite difierentl the male is winged and flies about in a modest Quaker garb of gray fluttering with broad weak wings about the trunks of the trees and paying court to the grublike wingless females which are less flighty than their mates A larger propor tion of individuals appear in the spring than winter This provision of nature that a part of the brood shall appear in the autumn and a part in the spring ensures the life of the species since if it were not represented in part by the eggs and clnysalides a severe winter might destroy the latter 14 THE POPULATION OF AN APPLE TKEE 175 and cut off the brood The eggs have so thick a shell that it seems impossible that even great extremes of tem perature should destroy them They are laid in broad patches of from sixty to a hundred or more standing up side by side They are glued together and to the bark or paling by a grayish varnish secreted by a gland in the end of the bod In dealing with this caterpillar the obvious preventive measure is to keep the females from ascending the trunks of the trees and laying their eggs on the branches This is done in a cheap and efficacious way by surrounding the trunk of the tree with a band of tarred paper and anointing it with printers ink If the ink is daily applied this is a cheap and sure preventive Another one involving more expense but less time and trouble is to surround the base of the trunk with a wooden trough kept filled with oil or ink or it may be raised and made of zinc and filled with whale oil But all these methods are useless unless the shiftless and careless are compelled to cooperate with those who take pains to keep their trees free from the caterpillars We have ventured to suggest in our first Report on the Injurious and Beneficial Insects of Massachusetts that it is only by combination between farmers and orchardists that these and other pests can be kept under As we then said The matter can be best reached b legislation we have fish and game laws why should wc not frame a law provid ing that farmers and all those owning a garden or orchard sliould cooperate in taking preventive measures against inju rious insects such as early or late planting of cereals to avert the attacks of the Wheat midge and Hessian fly the burning of stublle in the autumn and spring to destroy the joint worm the combined use of proper remedies against the canker worm the various cut worms and other noxious caterpillars A law carried out by a proper state entomo logical constabulary if it may be so designated could com 15 176 HALF HOUPtS WITH INSECTS pel the idle and shiftless to clear their farms and gardens of noxious animals We trust that those interested will not suffer this matter to drop but that a law correcting this abuse of privilege in letting these destructive insects run riot may be framed and passed Among the natural enemies of the canker worm is the Calosoma scrutator Fig 139 a beautiful ground beetle which ascends the trunlis of the trees and devours the cater pillars Certain wasps particularly the Eumenes store up the caterpillars in their nests The Tachina fly and an icli Pjq jgg neumon fly are also said to prey on them while hogs and fowl devour the chrysalides Next to the parasitic ichneu mons however the smaller birds aie the most efficacious in destroying them I extract as follows from a paper in the American Naturalist May 1874 important testimony on this point I am indebted to Mr C J Maynard of Ipswich for the Calosoma scrutator following information upon the birds which devour the canker worm He informs me that in the course of his investigations he has opened the stomachs of some three thousand birds In answer to your questions relative to birds eating can ker worms and the larvae of other injurious insects I would say that upon examining my notes I find that I have taken canker worms from the stomachs of the following species redeyed vireo Vireo oUvaceus song sparrow 3Ielospiza melodia chickadee Parus atricapillus scarlet tanager Pyranga rubra robin Turdus migratorius black billed cuckoo Coccygus erythrophthalvius wood pewee Contopus  vieus least pewee Empidonax minimus Wilsons thrush Turdus fuscescens black and white creeper MiiiotiUa varia blue yellowbacked warbler

cedrorum cat bird Mimtts Carolinensis purple finch Carpodacus purpureus white winged crossbill Cur virostra lericoptera chipping sparrow Spizella socialis indigo bird Cyanospiza cyanea redwinged blackbird Agelaius plioiniceus cow blackbird Molothrus pecoris bobolink Dolichonyx oryzivorus Baltimore oriole Icterus Baltimore Possibly this list may be increased Besides these birds those species which occur in orchards during autumn and winter such as the ruby crowued wren brown creeper nut hatches and titmice doubtless eat laxgely of the eggs of canker worms and other insects which destroy or injure the trees Winter birds of the above species which I have shot at this time have their stomachs crammed with insects of some kind As I remarked to you the other evening the Baltimore oriole will eat largely of the tent caterpillar and is the only bird which will do this All the thrushes will eat wire worms The swallows de stroy multitudes of dipterous insects gnats etc In fact to sum the matter up there is scared a bird which will not eat largely of insects at certain seasons when these pests are most abundant It is a noticeable fact that many species inhabiting woods and meadows as may be seen by the list given leave their 12 17 178 HALF HOUliS WITH INSECTS usual haunts and visit the fruit trees wliich are covered with canker worms and kxrgely devour them In reference to the currant saw fly worm Nematus ventri cosus I am not certain that I have seen an birds eat them 5et I think the truly insectivorous species will do this That the Baltimore oriole sometimes eats large quantities of the American tent caterpillar Clisiocanvpa Americana since tliey have been found in the stomach of this bird by Mr Maynard is an interesting fact for birds as a rule do not relish hsdvy caterpillars and the Anaerican tent caterpil lar is covered with long hairs though they are not so dense as in some other larvae In Europe the closely allied tent caterpillar C neustria and those of the Cnethocampa and Liparis chrysorrhasa are said by Perris and others to be almost untouched by birds I have been told by Dr T M Brewer of Boston that the English sparrows upon the com mon devoured all the caterpillars of the tussock moth Or gyia which were injuring a fine tree These caterpillars are very hair being adorned with pencils and tufts of long hairs Mr John H Sears of Danvers Mass who has paid much attention to the habits of our birds informs me that the cuckoo which breeds near houses is an exceedingly useful bird as it devours the canker worms in large num bers It is well that this should be known as there is a popular prejudice against this bird from its habit of suck ing the eggs as well as laying its eggs in the nests of other birds Among the birds which he has himself ob served in the act of eating canker worms are the king bird the Baltimore oriole the cat bird the common fl catcher the least flycatcher or wood pewee the red eyed vireo and a few other small birds such as certain war blers and flycatchers The king bird in the month of May feeds on May beetles as stated by Mr J L Hersey in this journal IS THE POPULATION OF AN APPLE TREE 179 I also quote from a letter on the subject for which I am iiulebted to Dr T M Brewer Tlie most noticeable of all the destroyers of the canker worm is the common cedar bird which devours them to an extent perfectly enormous Next is the purple grakle which also feeds on them as long as they last The house pigeon if in any numbers is an invaluable bird See for instance a garden corner of Summer and Chestnut streets Salem where the pigeons make canker worms a thing unknown Among the other birds all excellent so far as they go are the chipping sparrow the song sparrow the purple finch all the vireos whiteeyed redeyed yellowthroated solitary and warbling the king bird the cat bird the downy wood pecker the summer yellow bird Maryland yellow throat the bluebird The bluejay eats their eggs in the winter so does the chickadee The latter eats their grub also and the worm too The common gray creeper which is with us onl in the winter eats the eggs Last summer I had a nest of goldenwinged woodpeckers breeding on my place at Hingham Some of them dug into my barn and passed the winter Only a part of my trees were protected by a belt of printers ink and some of them were partially eaten but this winter very few grubs have as yet shown themselves and I give my friend Colaptes aura tus the credit of all this I know tliis I gave tlie young ones a lot of worms myself and they ate them as if they were used to them The old birds were too shy to permit me to sec their good deeds I think the golden robin feeds its young with them as long as they last but I am not sure that they eat the tent caterpillar I nearly forgot the two cuckoos yellowbill and blackbill They eat every form of caterpillar canker worms included 1 do not think the robin feeds any to its joung because it would never do they are too small and its brood want a big lot I have known the robin to feed its younfr 19 180 for entire days as fast as they could bring tliem with the moth of the cutworm That is about as much as we could expect any bird to do at one time At the rate they went they must have caught and given their young ones about five hundred of these moths in a da Before that I had supposed that the robin did me more harm than good but I had to give in My indebtedness to that pair was worth all the cherries I could raise in many years So the robin and I are fast friends From the facts already presented it may be inferred how useful birds may become in the work of reducing the num ber of injurious insects Undoubtedly we have suffered greatly by our wanton killing of the smaller birds We are far behind European nations in caring for the insect eating kinds and providing nests for them about our houses and gardens The Swiss and French have been the most farsighted in this matter of the protection of the smaller insectivorous species The English Scandinavians and Germans foster them while in our country teeming as it is with hosts of ravaging insects the smaller birds are hunted and persecuted or if let alone there is no effort made on any extended scale to invite them to our houses and gardens The Apple Sphinx This modest gray hawk moth rather smaller than the generality of the species appears in June and lays scattered eggs on the leaves from Avhich the cater pillars hatch They are large peagreen worms with seven oblique violet stripes along each side and a horn on the end of the body It is the Sphinx gorcllus The larva of another hawk moth with a rough granular skin a bluish horn and seven yellowish white streaks on the side is also found on the apple The moth is fawn colored with the wings notched the hinder pair bearing a large black eye spot centred with blue It is the Smeriyithus exccucatus The Swalloiv Tail Butterfly The caterpillar of Pcqnlio Turnus is occasionally found on the leaves of the apple It 20 THE POPULATION OF AJST APPLE TEEE 181 is a smooth fat green worm ¦with two eyelike spots beliind the head It changes to a chrysalis in August These three caterpillars do little or no harm to the tree and are only mentioned on account of their large size and curious appearance The Apple Nola We have not ourselves identilled the caterpillar of this well known moth It is said by Di Fitch to be a rather thick cylindrical light green worm an inch long with five white lines and numerous white dots and was observed eating notches and lioles in the leaves It changes to a cocoon in a curved leaf The moth appears in Julj and also hibernates flying about in spring It is gray crossed by three zigzag black lines It is the Nola vicdana The Bud Worm One of the most injurious insects of the apple tree nesit to the canker worm that we have is a small reddishbrown larva which during certain years threatens in some localities the extinction of our apple crop It was described by Harris in his Treatise on the Insects injurious to Vegetation under the name of Penthina ocidcnia and should now be named Grapholitha oculana The caterpillar is a small cylindrical naked worm about a third of an inch in length and of a uniform reddishbrown with small warts from which aiise short fine hairs while tlie head and upper side of the prothoracic ring or segment next the head is black On May 16th I noticed this caterpillar on the apple and also the pear and cherr perforating the half expanded leaf and flower buds They were very abundant on these buds and afterwards when the leaves had partially expanded they had folded them It seems to hatch out about the time that the canker worms and American tent catorpiUars leave their eggs that is about the first daj of Ma when the buds unfold The last of May and the first week of Ji«ic they were swaxmiug in orchards throughout eastern 21 182 HALF IlOUPtS WITH rNgECTS Massachusetts man persons noticing their attacks and it seems to be a common insect all over New England When fully grown it crumples the leaves disfiguring the whole tree and doing great damage to the fruitbuds and flowers thus directly lessening the apple and pear crop About the first of June the cease eating and make a loose delicate silken cocoon in the folded leaf They remain several days sometimes nearly two weeks in this condition before assuming the chrysalis state about the IGth of June and the moths are seen flying about and entering houses attracted by the light within during the last week of June and the first of July The chrysalis is brown and of the usual shape and as Hanis states has but a single row of teeth along the dorsal side of each abdominal segment After the moth has slipped out of the pupa case the empty shell re mains attached by the tip of the abdomen to the surface of the leaf The moth is of a dark ash color the fore wings being usu ally paler in the middle The basal third of the wing is dark ash mottled with paler scales the outer edge of the dark area being angulated just behind the middle of the wing The costa is marked with light and dark bands On the outer third the wing is nearly as dark as on the base near the outer edge and halfway between the costa and hind edge are four wellmarked longitudinal black spots or short lines running parallel with the costa or Iront edge of the wing the one nearest the costa is simply an elongated dot the second and largest is an oblong spot and twice as wide as the third spot while the fourth again is much smaller There are three similar black marks situated on the inner edge at the outer third of the wing When the wings are folded over the back these black marks collec tively make a rudely triangular figure The outer third of the wing is also variously banded and mottled with leaden blue and tawny brown scales The fringe is brown ud 22 THE P0PULATI0N OF AN APPLE TREE 183 leaden blue The hind wings are dark ash biown Beneath the fore Yings are not mottled but uniformly dark ash brown and a shade lighter than the upper surface of the hind wings It expands about 55 of an inch It varies in the distribution of the black spots and in the degree of angularity of the outer edge of the basal dark portion of the fore wings and in some specimens the middle of the wing is concolorous with the other parts and the peculiar leaden blue scales are scattered over the whole wing with a black patch on the inner third of the Aving near the inner edge In some specimens there are more than four dots near the outer edge of the wing forming a trans verse row As these worms attack the fruit and leafbuds it is diffi cult to pick them off by the hand without injuring the buds nor is it easy to apply whaleoil soap or a weak solution of carbolic acid Both of these remedies however should be tried especially showering the terminal branches of the tree with soap suds or a very weak solution of carbolic acid A faithful application for one season of these and other remedies will materially lessen the numbers of this formid able pest The Palmer Worm During the latter part of June as observed on the Hudson River the leaves of the apple be come badly wormeaten with the remnants carelessl sewn together with fine silken threads Wlieu the bunch of leaves is disturbed out scrambles a pale yellowish green catrpil lar with a dusky stripe along each side edged above witli a narroAV white stripe and drois a few inches hanging sus pended by a thread This is the Palmer worm described under the name of ChoitocJiibcs pometellas Harris This insect has not been of late years at all common in our orchards We »avc had no personal acquaintance with it and the following account of it is condensed from Fitchs admirable description There are insect years as well as  Pacicaed apple years Seasons when through favoring causes certain species appear in extraordinar numbers The causes would not seem to be wholly climatic for during seasons that may seem to be peculiarly favorable to insect life every species does not abound in equal numbers It seems more probable that the increase in a species is owing to a decrease in the numbers of the ichneumons attacking it though the causes leading to the partial extinction of the ichneumon may be unknown How full of interest would be a study of such phenomena as the periodical or unusual abundance of certain animals No subject could be more attractive to the biolo gist while none is of more practical importance to the gar dener or farmer and it is just such studies as these that our young students should take up In the year 1791 says Fitch the orchards and forests of New England were overrun by this worm and the leaves of the apple oak and other trees were devoured by it It was at this time that it received the name Palmer worm by which it has since been currently designated This name was evidently derived from our English translation of the sacred scriptures Another insect which a month or two before had devastated the fruit trees to an extent never pre viously known appears simultaneously to have received the name which it still retains the canker worm for previously to this date we find this name given to what is now called the army worm Leucania unipunctata Another re markable visitation of these insects occurred in the 3ear 1853 unparalleled by any event of this kind within tlie mem ory of the present generation It appeared suddenly in excessive numbers from Maine to eastern New York The Palmer worm appears about the middle of June about the time the canker worm is entering the earth and continues till the close of the month It strips off the foliage thus emulating the gastronomical feats of the canker worm Dr Fitch says that should after a Aisitation from these worms the weather during the month of July prove to be dry and hot as it frequently is the damage is much more extensive whole orchards and forests perishing In 1853 the worms continued in full force until the night of the 23d of June when brisk showers occurred accompanied with heavy thun der terminating the drouth which had prevailed and with this the worms suddenly disappeared In one orchard a thousand bushels of apples were destroyed that being the usual yield When they are young these worms eat only the green pulpy tissues of the leaf leaving its network of veins entire But as they become larger and more robust the consume the whole of the leaf except the coarse veins It is the 3oung and tender leaves however which grow at or near the tips of the limbs which they prefer the older and tougher leaves are commonly eaten only at their tip ends and have irregular holes of various sizes gnawed in them some of these holes being no larger than a puncture made with a pin The green succulent ends of the twigs are also frequently eaten off And the young apples which were nearly as large as wahiuts when these worms made their appearance almost without exception had either round holes or larger irregular cavities gnawed in their surface Thus wounded they wilt and fall from the tree a few only having the wounds so slight that they recover and remain upon the tree until they ripen The moth into which the Palmer worm transforms closely resembles the Gelechia of the granaries It is of an ash gray color with six or seven equidistant black dots at the base of the fringe on the outer edge of the wing In the middle of the wing are four larger dark dots which are placed olliqucly with regard to each other the wings ex pand between a half and threequarters of an inch It belongs to the family of Tineids which have small narrow wings with long silky fringes The common clothes moth is a tyie of the family Fitch recommends showering the 25 186

the apple in immense num bers mining the leaves leaving a serpentine blotch to mark the site of its gallery It bears the sesquipedalian name of Litliocolletis geminateUa It is figured in all its

also blackish When it becomes fully fed it transforms into a chrjsalis within its mine When dis turbed it crawls rapidly out of its domicile and hangs sus pended by a thread unwittingly open to the

dark 3ellowish green tinged with reddish in front with a brown head ft was found feeding externally on the leaves late in September Early in October it changes to a chrysa lis within a long wdiite cocoon slenderer but about as long as a grain of rice it is tough and thick and ribbed exter nally It is a common object found attached to the bark of the tree in May as well as the autumn and winter These little moths are not exempt from parasitic ichneumons of exceeding minuteness which send them to an early grave Indeed the mortality among moths is greatest during their childhood when they are in the chrysalis state While a few caterpillars like very many hu man children die of overeating the greater number of deaths are due to causes beyond the control of the cat erpillar In Europe twelve hundred species of minute chalcid ichneumon flies are known to exist and of tliese many prey on tlic Tineids I have found a most singular form preying on the Bucculatrix of the cedar B thiciella Fig 140 enlarged a co coon natural size which closel resembles the apple moth In endeavoring to rear the moth from the cocoon I found that nearly half of the cocoons gathered from a cedar tree in mj 3ard failed to give out their appropriate tenant but instead rendered account in the form of minute beautifully brilliant green flies with golden metallic tints The antennae branched out like the antlers of a reindeer each having at the end five branches somewhat resembling a Jaianese comb These little flies are wortli far more than their weight in gold and were their worth duly appreciated our gardeners would look upon the 27 Bucculatinc tluiielhi 188 HALF HOUES WITH INSECTS cultivation of ichneumon flies as tlie rigiit arm of tlie ser vice in an enlightened agriculture The Apple MIcropiteryx The most abundant leaf miner of the apple so bus a laborer that for several jears past nearly every other leaf on the apple trees in my garden wit nesses their plodding patient work is the Micropteryx po mivorella nearly all these minute slenderwinged moths have monstrously long names The caterpillar is a minute dark peagreen flat worm the body thickest in the middle and very soft It is about a line in length It eats its way in the interior of the leaf between the upper and the under side feeding on the soft pulp Its burrow is marked by a broad waved dark line on the leaf which widens at the farther end and is somewhat puflTed out owing to the presence of the fully fed caterpillar In this little terminal chamber the worm rests and when anxious to leave it in order to spin its cocoon effects its escape through a slit which it has had the instinct or com mon sense previously to cut with its jaws So abundant is it that multitudes of these little green worms may be seen hanging helplessly from the leaves of the tree Suspended by this thread they swing to and fro until they strike some twig whence they go to the bark of the trunk and laiger branches Here in warm days late in September and early in October the worms spin a peculiar flattened round silken jellow cocoon about a line in diameter In con finement I have noticed that it will spin its cocoon on the leaves but in nature it is careful to deposit them on the branches where it remains through the winter The larva completes the cocoon at least all that is visible within the space of one hour The moth was

call it Like a boy in a meal sack with his arms sprawling about and pulling himself along the little caterpillar pokes its head out of its case extends its six fore legs like so many hands and pulls itself over the leaf its little world The worm is flattened green and no thicker than a small knitting needle The case or sac is oval open at each end much flattened and roomy enough for its inhab itant to turn around in How the case is constructed we have been unable to observe While some sac bearers cut an oblong slit in the leaf fold it over and then cutting a corresponding slit remove the folded portion fasten together with silk the open side wriggle into this straight jacket and walk off as if they had been born with their houses on their backs others probably construct their cases out of fine bits of leaf stuck together Avith tlie silken glue secreted frona the glands emptying into their mouths The material of such cases resembles a thick feltlike cloth and that of our sac bearer is of this nature By the end of August the caterpil lar becomes mature and ready to transform into a chrsalis It does not desert its old coat but hangs it by a few threads to the bark of the tree and contracts its body lies quiet through the winter until early in summer the cluysalis breaks through a rent in its skin and soon after the moth appears It is now one of the most beautiful objects in nature It is very small the head finely dusted its softly 29 190 fringed wings expanding only a fifth of an inch Its fore wings are of a light slate gray color on their inner half and be3ond bright orange enclosing two white bands one situ ated on the front edge and the other arising from the inner edge both nearly meeting in the middle of the wing and edged externally with black There is a very conspicuous square black spot near the fringe in which is a long pencil of black hairs Such startling contrasts of yellow and black are seldom worn by these diminutive moths but na

exuberant DrFitch says that the eggs are small oval shining black and placed by the parent in autumn deep in the cracks and crevices in the bark of the tree Now as he suggests the practical way to deal with these pests is to scrape off the dead bark of the old trees and whitewash all the trees early in No vember or very early in the spring before the buds begin to open for at this period the young Aphides hatch as they may be found clustered round the buds and as soon as the green leaves begin to show tliemselves the Aphides puncture them This Aphis is a European importation The head and

about the house when the apple trees are in blossom and again in the middle of August when the apples are half formed Many may recall the appearance of the repulsive little whitish caterpillar or worm occurring in wormy apples who are not at all acquainted with the moth It is rather smaller than the apple leaf roller with narrower wings and grajdsh ashcolored Across the wings pass slightly marked numerous darker transverse lines with a prominent curved black line edged with a coppery tint near an eyelike patch on the inner angle The wings expand over half an inch She lays her eggs in the calyx

worm deserts it creeps up under the bark of the tree cocooning and in a few da3s after a brood of moths appear They are the parents of the worms which may be found through the winter and early spring under the bark housed in their cocoons Taking advantage of this habit of cocooning in crevices the best plan in dealing with these insects is to wind cloths and bands of straw around the trunks During the last half of summer and the autumn they can be removed every few days and burned and others put in their place When the fruit is stored in the cellar the maggots of three kinds of flies emulate the example of the caterpillar of the coddling moth and further despoil the orchardist and wound the feelings of the lover of good apples 32 INSECTS OF THE FIELD 193 8 Iu86tt8 ni ilxB fwia WE will now

walk down Broadway or along the Strand is to the rustic Insects love the open fields Under the shade of the forests they pursue their avocations in comparative silence in the garden or orchard their

alighting at some pool to quench their thirst The mosqui toes we scarcely expect to find on the breezy plains The still forest the darker and damper the better is their home Favoring winds support

When a tree is separated from its fellows and left stand ing in a field it becomes the centre of attack of many different varieties of insects If an oak its twigs are hung with countless galls the

Chain moth and caterpillar symmetry of the oak is maintained by the judicious pruning of boring beetles and other insects while its boughs afibrd rest and shelter to the birds which in their turn judiciouslj check the too great increase of the insect plunderers and instal a reign of conservative agencies which maintain the oak in its pristine vigor and hands it down from generation to generation of landed proprietors The growth and main tenance of field crops are almost wholly regulated by the insects now that the birds are not allowed a fair chance of restraining the undue increase of these pests Our potato crops are becoming dependent on the number of insects rather than the excellence of artificial fertilizers we may topdress our wheat fields and till the soil never so sedu lousl but the fact is well known that the wheat crop in the eastern states is nearly cut off by the Hessian fly the wheat midge and the joint worm Our corn fields in the far West are dependent on the will of the grasshopper and the chinch bug The losses annually sustained by the assaults of the armies of injurious insects are almost beyond calculation and so quietly and neatly is the work done that few are the farmers who realize the extent of the loss and how it has been effected Not until they study the daily life of these insects and watch them bj day and night and fig U9 know something of their life history until they recognize the fact that as caterpillars and chrysal ides and winged insects they lead different lives have quite different means of livelihood can they appreciate the extent of the powers for mischief in the little beings they trample on unconsciously or in contempt What meaning is there in the bustle and hum ° ® of insect life to which the ears of most of us are deaf The only way to answer this question is to sit down for oneself and watch the daily doings of some one insect and make a record of them by which others may profit The busiest man can devote a few minutes each day to a study of the common insects that enter his window or visit the flowers in his garden He can readily train the ladies of the house hold or the children to aid in the work of observation and by thus combining the aid of several observers test their several results All this does not require a scientific knowl edge of the anatomy and physiology of these creatures only a little patience and interest in the subject of inquiry An 5 19I example of what one may do whose time is occupied with multifarious duties is afforded by the results obtained by Sir John Lubbock and published in a paper entitled Observa tions on Bees and Wasps read at a late 1874 meeting of the Linniean Society of London In order to ascertain how a honey bee fills out the measure of a day he kept some bees in a hive in his room and marked some of them and watched their goings in and out A bee between 7 am and 1252 PM made twentythree visits from the hive to the honey During an hour and twenty minutes of this time access to the honey was cut off Another bee between 723 AM and 1251 pm made nineteen visits to the honey the door being closed for thirty minutes of the time Still another bee between 919 am and 154 pm made twenty visits to the honey Other data are given showing the close application of these bees to their business and that the popular notions as to their busy ways are well founded They apparently work after noon as well as before noon rrru e «r Ouc of Lubbocks marked bees whitefaced Wasp made twentyeight visits be tween 1215 PM and 614 pm Similar experiments made on wasps Fig 150 whitefaced wasp show that they emu late the busy ways of their cousins the bees Indeed it is perhaps not too rash a conclusion to draw from these and observations on other insects that a ceaseless activity per vades the members of the republic of insects and that their moments of rest only result in still greater activity Were it not for this unremitting toil in providing for the welfare of their progeny which in bees especially consists in extracting honey from flowers many species of plants would become extinct Nay it is safe to state that many 6 Packaud insects or THE FIELD 199 kinds of plants would never have been brought into exis tence at all had it not been through the modifying influence of bees and moths The interdependence of insects and plants latel shown to exist b various observers is one of the most striking in nature Many gardeners are aware that bees aid greatly in the fertilization of the flowers of the melon cucumber and squash by conveying the pollen of one flower to another and to those of adjoining gardens This ensures the production of fruit where otherwise many a flower would be barren It is known that a larger crop of apples is raised when a hive of bees is stationed in the or chard The bees visit every flower busily flying from one to another and then passing to an adjoining tree Their bodies dusted over with the pollen rub against the pistils of hundreds of flowers which thus become fertilized In the same manner the moths bobbing their heads into the tubu lar flowers of the orchids and other plants probe them with their long tongues and Avithdraw them with a packet of pol len attached which they leave on the pistil of some other plant In this way the plant maintains its existence and there is no deterioration in the stock since the pollen is conveyed from plants afar off by the bees and too close inandin breeding a thing nature abhors is prevented Now this sort of work is going on far more extensively than was suspected before Mr Darwin called the attention of naturalists to the matter It seems from the studies of Sprengel Darwin Hermann Miillor and others that on the other hand many of the strange modifications in the form of flowers are due to insects Not only are clianges in form produced by the different kinds of insects and their varying mouthparts but it has been boldly suggested that origin ally the scent and color and even the honey of flowers are due to the influence of insects On the other hand any one On Britisli Wild Flowers considered in Relation to Insects By Sir John Lubbock MacmUlan Co 1875 uUUfii ALP HOURS WITH INSECTS Hbyeading the admirably lucid statements of Miiller and Lubboclv can for himself realize how dependent the form of the insect particularly the form of the mouthparts and legs are on the form of the flower As Lubbock remarks there has thus been an interaction of insects upon flowers and of flowers upon insects resulting in the gradual modification of both The transfer of pollen from plants of different varieties or species results in hybrids which are much larger than the original forms Cross fertilization as this is called is an advantage to the plant and is resorted to constantly as ever body knows by horticulturists Lubbock quotes Dar wins remark that all experimenters have been struck with the wonderful vigour height size tenacity of life precocity and hardiness of their hybrid productions Mr Darwin was the first to show that if a flower be fertilized by pollen from a different plant the seedlings so produced are much stronger than if the plant be fertilized by its own pollen Lubbock from whom we take this statement saw these ex periments of Mr Darwin and remarks that the difference was most striking It is moreover remarkable that in many cases plants are themselves more fertile if supplied with pollen from a different flower a different variety or even as it would appear in some instances in the passion flower for example from a different species Nay in some cases pollen has no effect whatever unless transferred to a different flower Fritz Midler has recorded some species in which pollen if placed on tlie stigma of the same flower has not only no more effect than so much inorganic dust but which is perhaps even more extraordinary in others he states that the pollen placed on the stigma of its own flower acted on it like a poison This he noticed in several species the flower faded and fell off the pollen grains themselves and the stigma in contact with them shrivelled up turned brown and decayed while other flowers on the LN SECTS OF THE FIELD 201 same branch which were not so treated retained their fresh ness Now as we have said the great agencies in nature in performing this act of cross fertilization are llie wind and insects principally the latter The stamens and pistils of the pines birches poplars grasses corn and other cereals are so arranged that the Avind fertilizes them but in a largo nnmber of flowers the stamens are so situated in relation to the pistils that the ovule in the latter can only bo fertilized by the agency of insects For this end the plant must hold out some inducement to the bees and moths in order to attract them something besides bright colors and sweet smells which are known to attract insects Flowers how ever sweetsmelling or beautiful would not be visited by insects unless they had some inducements more substantial to offer These advantages are the pollen and the honey although it has been suggested that some flowers beguile insects hy holding out the expectation of honey which does not really exist just as some animals repel their enemies by rcsemlling other species which are either dangerous or disa greeable That many insects arc attracted b smells wg well know but Lubbock has been the flrst to show that bees and wasps are attracted by and can distinguish colors I placed he says slips of glass Avith honey on paper of various colours accustoming different bees to visit special colours and when they had made a few visits to honey on paper of a particular colour I found that if the papers were transposed the bees followed the colour The bright streaks of different hues which adorn the petals of flowers serve the most utilitarian purpose namely as guiding lines to show the bee the way down to the deposit of honey At figure 151 indicates the bright col ored guiding lines which lead down to the nectary Lub bock remarks that he did not realize the importance of these guiding lines until by experiments on bees he saw how 9 202 mucli time they lose if lioney which is put out for them is moved even slightly from its usual place With good rea son therefore he adopts Sprengels suggestion that the lines and bands by which so many flowers are ornamented have reference to the position of the honey Lubbock observes that these honey guides are absent in night flowers where of course they would not be visible and would therefore be useless as for instance in certain English flowers as Lychnis vespertina or Silene nutans it is a curious fact that the for mer flower is white while Lychnis diurna which flowers by day is red In some cases bees baffled in their attempts to find the honey take a short cut and perforate the corolla with their jaws The first and only instance yet known of this curious Fig 151 Geiardia perforated bj bees trait in this country is that given by Mr W W Bailey in the American Naturalist 1873 He noticed that the flowers of Gerardla edicularia were perforated by the bees at the point indicated by p in figure 151 also seen at a where the corolla is split open Mr Bailey writes I have seen bees approach the front for a moment and then retire 10 INSECTS OF THE FIELD 203 as if bafilod Most of them however begin operations at the back at once The alight with the tail towards the open end of the flower and at once insert the head into tlie little hole I have never seen them make the apertnre although it is difficult to find a blossom without one Even the buds are often penetrated out of a large number of flowers plucked at random from different plants in different localities I can not find one flower without the slit The bees alluded to were humble bees In Europe they are known to perforate the flowers of the bean and similar plants Lubbock in concluding a chapter on the importance of insects to flowers says that to insects flowers are indebted for their scent and colour nay for their very existence in their present form Not only have the present shape and outlines the brilliant colours the sweet scent and the honey of flowers been gradually developed through the unconscious selection exercised by insects but the very arrangement of the colours the circular bands and radiating lines the form size and position of the petals the relative situations of the stamens and pistil are all arranged with reference to the visits of insects and in such a manner as to insure the grand object whfch these visits are destined to effect It will be seen from these facts and suggestions that the distribution of insects depends largely on that of plants A field of clover will attract humble bees for miles around the night flying moths are attracted long distances to those flowers which are open at dusk at night or in the early morn ing such as the honeysuckles pinks scarlet runners petu nias and other tubular flowers Indeed Lubbock remarks in this connection that flowers which are fertilized by night flying insects would derive no advantage from being open by day and on the other hand that those which arc fertilized by bees would gain nothing by being open at night Nay it would be a distinct disadvantage because it would render them liable to be robbed of their honey and pollen by in 11 204 HALP HOURS WITH INSECTS sects which are not capable of fertilizing them I would venture to suggest then that the closing of flowers may have reference to the habits of insects and it may be ob served also in support of this that windfertilized flowers do not sleep and that some of those flowers which attract insects bj smell emit their scent at particular hours thus Hesperis matronalis and Lychnis vespertina smell in tlie evening and Orchis hifolia is particularly sweet at night The tongue of the hawk moth is often of great length adapting it for probing the deep corollas of various orchids etc For example the tongue of the moth of the tobacco worm Fig 152 a caterpillar 6 chrjsalis with its large tongue case reaching to the middle of the body is very long but still moderate in its proportions compared to that of a Madagascar species in which it attains a length of nine and a quarter inches and as there are said to be orchids with flowers as deep as this there is evidently a relation of cause and effect between the two facts Some moths such as the silk worm moths have the tongue undeveloped and they are not known to visit flowers Other modifications in the palpi and legs of insects are correlated with the different methods insects take to collect and bear away pollen and honey It is a significant fact which has been alluded to by authors that in the arctic regions many flowers are wanting which elsewhere are fertilized by insects also absent from circumpolar lands If plants were introduced they would become extinct possibly not on account of the severity of the climate but because there would be no insects to render the flowers fertile and capable of producing seeds The advent of mauy if not nearly all the flowering plants in past geological periods undoubtedly went hand in hand with the appearance of insects Now the bees and moths and butterflies particularly the bees are among the most highl developed of insects and were the last to appear in the later geological periods What a striking exemplification of the 12 IXSECTS OF THE FIELD 205 Fig Ir2 The Tolacco Worm Cliiysalis and ftfoth 13 206 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS harmonies of nature this coeval birth of flowers and insects each modifying the other new forms of animals giving rise to new floral creations But in this utilitarian age and country it will not do to speak of field insects without mentioning those which ravage our field crops as well as those which aid introducing them Perhaps no insect in this country except the cotton worm has carried more consternation among farmers than the plumpbodied phlegmatic welltodo looking beetle which from living a quiet harmless life on the wild useless species of Solanum in the valleys at the base of the Rocky Moun tains has suddenly invaded our potato fields and robbed our farmers of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of this important crop Not a European importation this insect has made its home in a region of our country differing far more in its ph3sical and climatic features from its native territory than does Europe from the northeastern states It is an example to use the language of the botanists of a prepotent insect which lilce a weed when introduced into a new country increases far more rapidly than at home and crowds out the native insects asserting itself everywhere in our farms and highways and byways Mr B D Walsh late state entomologist of Illinois has given us an interesting history in the Practical Entomol ogist of the first appearance of this insect He shows that the original home of this beetle was in the valleys of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado Territory where for nearly fifty years it has been known to feed upon a wild spe cies of potato Solanum rostratum When these vallejs became settled and the potato planted there this beetle adopted it as its food and then began a new chapter in its history It should be remembered that the potato is also a species of Solanum and the change in the nature of the beetles food not great By 1859 it had spread eastward to within a hundred miles of Omaha Nebraska In 1861 it 14 IJSrSEOTS OF THE FIELD 207 passed into Iowa and in 18G4 and 1865 it crossed tlie Mis sissippi a thing whicli never ought to have been allowed It invaded Illinois on its western border crossing over from northeastern Missouri and Iowa Mr Walsh predicted that it would advance eastward at the rate of fifty miles a year In 1868 it appeared in Ohio Mr Riley states that its aver age annual progress towards the east has been upwards of seventy miles At the same rate of progression it Avill touch the Atlantic Ocean in about ten years from now or AD 1878 But in fact it has travelled faster than that and the year 1876 will witness the arrival of this pilgrim from the west in the potato patches of the descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers This beetle belongs to the family of leafeating Coleoptera or Chrysomelidse of which the common striped squash Fig 153 Fig 154 Doryphora juncta D 10lincata beetle is a familiar example It lays its eggs on the leaves of the plant it inhabits in the larva or

habits In the latitude of St Louis there are three broods during the 3ear the last brood wintering over in the beetle state under ground They are usually dug up in the spring of the 3ear in land that had been planted to potatoes the jear before The beetles issue of their own accord from the ground about the first of Ma and the last brood of beetles enters the ground to hibernate during the month of October Though in general terms this beetle may be said to be threebrooded yet it may be found at almost any time of the year in all its different stages This is owing to the fact that the female continues o deposit her eggs in patches from time to time covering a period of about forty das and also from the fact that among those laivae which all batch out in one day some will develop and become beetles a week and even ten dajs earlier than others Thus it ma be that some of the late individuals of the third brood pass the winter in the pupa state though the normal habit is to first transform to beetles Each female is capable of depos iting upwards of a thousand eggs before she becomes barren and in from thirty to forty da3s from the time they were deposited they will have produced perfect beetles These beetles are again capable of depositing eggs in about two weeks after issuing from the ground and thus in about fifty days after the egg is laid the offspring begins to propagate This insect should not be confounded with a closely allied species D juncta Fig loo which feeds upon the horse nettle Solanum CaroUnense a wild plant common in the southern and western

and west We were less to blame for allowing the Hessian fly to get a foothold in our land During the Revolutionary war before we had gained a nationality this midge was brought over in straw by the Hessian troops As early as 1788 at least this insect or one exactly like it in habits as shown by Dr Harris was known to be destructive in Switzerland Harris states that jt was first observed in the yeal 1776 in the neighborhood of Sir William Howes debarkation on Staten Island and at Flat Bush on the west end of Long Island The history of its advance inland as given by Harris is a repetition of the mode of naturalization of the European cabbage butterfly and saw fly known with cer tainty to be imported insects The Hessian fly Fig 167 a larva b pupa is about 20 INSECTS OF THE FIELD 213 half the size of the mosquito but differs from it in wanting the long mouthparts wliile the antennjB are more hairy It is black with black wings while the hind body is tawny and the legs are pale red with black feet The body is about a tenth of an inch in lengtli and the wings expand about a quarter of an inch There are two broods the flies appearing both in spring and autumn At these times the fly lajs from twenty to thirty eggs in a crease in tlie leaf of the young plant Four days after if the weather be favor able the young pale red maggots may be seen crawling down the leaf until arriving at a joint in the stalk of the plant they remain head downwards as at figure 167 c Fig 107 Hessian FI7 and young under the base of the leaf where by the simple pressure of their bodies they become embedded in the side of the stem Two or three maggots thus embedded are sufficient to cause the plant to Avither and die In five or six weeks they ma ture and by the first of December their skin hardens and becomes of a chestnutlrown color This is the socalled flaxseed state The outer larval skin encases the larva or maggot whose body is contracted and somewhat changed in form In this state it remains through the winter Towards the end of April or early in May the pupa becomes perfected and by the middle of May in New England escapes from the  pupacase in which it has been wrapped like a mummy This occurs just as the wheat is coming up For a period extending over three weeks they lay their eggs and then disappear The maggots hatched by the eggs laid by the spring brood assume the flaxseed form in June and July and are found unchanged in the autumn most of them re maining in the stubble This is a most important fact of which the farmer may take advantage Now if the stubble be burned in the autumn millions of these maggots will be destroyed and if this process were carried on in every wheat field in the country the ravages of this and other destructive insects would be stayed As it is now we are almost wholly Fig 168 Parasite of Hessian Fly dependent on natures means of preventing their too great increase Figure 168 shows much enlarged a parasitic fourwinged Chalcid fly which has the instinct to thrust its ovipositor through the sheath of the leaf under which the maggot of the Hessian fly lurks and deposit an egg in its body Dr Fitch has suggested that the European parasite of this and the wheat midge should be imported and bred by the quantity so as to stop their ravages It would be a simple thing to do A quantity of stubble from an English or French wheat field could be imported and scattered over the wheat fields of southern New England and the Middle 22 ESrSECTS OF THE FIELD 215 States and in this way the parasites with but slight expense be had by the quantity Why have not commissioners before this been appointed by the several state authorities to attend to this important matter While the Hessian fly attacks the root the wheat midge adopts the ear as its point of attack When the wheat is in blossom the females lay their eggs in the evening in clusters of from two to twenty by means of the long retractile tubelike extremity of the body within the chaffy scales of the flowers The orangecolored maggots appear in from eight to ten days after and when fully grown are oneeighth of an inch long They crowd around the germ of the wheat Fig 169 Parasite of the Wheat Midge which by pressure becomes shrivelled and aborted About the first of August it casts the skin either while in the ear or after it has descended to the ground After descending to the earth it spins an earthen cocoon smaller than a mustard seed and remains through the winter about an inch under ground The midge appears the next June and July Figure 169 represents its most deadly parasite In dealing with this midge it is obvious that if the wheat field is ploughed after the stubble is burnt off either in the autumn or spring great numbers will be cut off for when buried five or six inches the fly is unable to reach the surface of the ground Another method is to sow grain late in the season 23 216 HALF HOURS WITH INSECTS for example in New England after the 15th or 20th of May By early sowing the 3oung wheat will have got the start of the flies and too large and strong for them to kill it For a third and often still more destructive insect which sometimes succeeds in cutting off a half and sometimes nearly the whole of a crop of wheat oats or barley we must turn to the very family of parasitic chalcid flies which are as a rule beneficial to agriculture A few of them make galls in the stems of plants and the maggots instead of feeding on the juices of living insects which serve as their hosts prey on the juices of plants Such is the famous joint worm or Eurytoma hordei This is a native insect It is a little shining black fourwinged fl a little over a line in length with the knees and feet pale yellow The hind body is attached by a slender pedicel to the thoiax and the male antennae are provided with tufts or verticils of fine hairs When the wheat or barley is about eight or ten inches high their growth is often checked the leaves turn jellow and irregular galllike swellings arise between the second and third joints of the stalk or in the joint itself In November in New England the worms transform into the pupa state living through the winter unchanged in the straw or remaining in the stubble in the field In Virginia where the joint worm has been fearfully destructive the maggot does not transform until late in February or early in March From early in May until the first week in July the flies issue from the galls in the dry stubble and are sup posed to immediately lay their eggs in the stalks of the young wheat or barley plants From a knowledge of the habits of this insect it is evident that the prudent farmer by cooperating with his neighbors can successfully cope with this insect if he and they are careful to burn the stubble in the autumn and spring and carry on the process for several successive years over a large 24 INSECTS OF THE FIELD 217 tract of countr Ploughing in the stubble in this case does not injure the insects as with their hard bodies they can work their way out of the earth The joint worm has several parasites members of its own family and it must be a pleasant sight to the agriculturist however it may strike the moralist to see the members of this large family falling upon and destroying one another and in such an atrocious way too Indeed our sole dependence for protec tion against noxious insects is the literally intestinal wars by which their numbers are kept down to a moderate figure The Army worm of the north is essentially a field insect It is not usually a common object but at long intervals it swarms in immense numbers cutting off acres of wheat barley oats and grass This worm is the caterpillar of the Leucania unipuncta one of the family of nightflying moths represented by the cut worms Agrotis see Figs 9 10 11 and Cucullia etc The present moth is rusty grayish ochre ous brown with the wings free from the usual markings and only a few dark dots forming a row parallel to the outer edge of the wing with a single white dot near the centre of the wing She probably lays her eggs near the roots of grasses such as the timothy and red top about the middle of June In the Middle and Western States the eggs arc probably laid in April and May and the moths lay their eggs for a second brood in June and Jul while in New England the moth appears in October and probably then lays eggs which do not hatch till the spring The caterpillars on hatching feed for alout four weeks until nearly fully fed when they stray oif to seek fresh pas tures Usually their numbers are inconsiderable but several times during the last and the present century they have ap peared in immense armies In New York and Now England they have occurred in great numbers in 1743 1770 1790 and 1817 In southern Illinois they abounded in 1818 or 1820 In 1842 they were very destructive In 1856 they 25 218 HALF HOUES WITH HNSECTS appeared in such numbers as to attract general attention but in 1861 the year in which the writer first made their acquaintance they were a grievous plague A writer in Danvers Mass says They were seen in great numbers through the entire field of several acres climbing up the stalks of the barley eating the blades and cutting off the heads of the grain The day after these worms were discovered the barley was mowed in order to preserve it when they dropped to the ground throwing themselves into a coil a habit of the insect when disturbed Many of them soon commenced a march for the neighboring fields and gardens while others blindly pushed forward a column across the highways over a stone wall where they were crushed by travellers on the road But the main body marched to the adjoining gardens and enclosures where the proprietors were waiting to receive them in their entrench ments which had been thrown up a foot wide and two feet deep The worms as they fell in their advance into the trenches were assailed in various ways by eager combatants some spreading over them lime tar or ashes while others resorted vigorously to pounding them In this way count less numbers of them were destroyed The rear guard composed principally of those of smaller growth kept in the field where they were picked up by a troop of fifty young redwinged blackbirds I also noticed the robins feeding on these vermin Again In adjoining lots they were commencing their devastation upon the corn turnips cab bages weeds and grass They leave the grass ground com pletely clean and white so that it has the appearance of having been scorched in the sun The cabbage and turnips they destroy by eating the tender parts of the plants while they attack the corn by descending the spindle and conceal ing themselves in large numbers among the leaves where the corn is to make its appearance Corn thus attacked looks wilted and drooping In some hills the stalks were stripped 26 Packabd insects of the FIELD 219 of all their leaves There were no worms upon the potato tops though they have killed all the grass to the borders of the field The name Army worm is suggestive of the regular trained way in which myriads of these caterpillars march together in long deep columns side by side steadily over every obstacle wherever their food or instinct may lead them Unlike the cut worms which move by night singly from field to field and secrete themselves by daytime at the roots of the plants they attack the Army worm feeds in the forenoon as well as the evening They may be seen scat tered over fields of grain or grass either devouring the leaves or cutting off the heads and letting them fall on the ground They will thus eat theirway across a field wan tonly mowing off the heads of the grain In this way in Plymouth county Mass they destroyed an acre and a half of wheat in one night and then attacked a corn field in the same ruthless manner This caterpillar appears first in July in Massachusetts and a month later in Maine where we saw it at Bangor and northward between the first and middle of August It is about an inch and a half long like the cut worm in shape It is dark with a light interrupted threadlike line along the middle of the back on the sides a light line edged with two threadlike lines and a light colored waved line just above the legs About the middle of August it descends into the earth and there constructs a rough earthen cocoon or contents itself with making a rude cell of dry grass just below the surface in a day or two after assuming the chrysalis state Lying here for ten days or a fortnight the moth flies about at the end of August In dealing with this insect the best remedy is of a pre ventive nature If the grass lands and wheat fields are buint over in autumn multitudes of the moths or chrysal 27 220 I ides will be destroyed The natural enemies are birds and ground beetles which collect about the rear and van of the moving army Six species of ichneumon flies prey upon them among which is a kind of Ophiou Fig 170 These parasites either attach an egg to the outside of the body of the caterpillar or insert it beneath the skin Mr Walsh who discovered most of these parasites also found that a Tachina fly an insect somewhat like the ordinary house fly was in Illinois so destructive that out of nearly sixty worms all but two had the eggs of these flies stuck in groups of Fig 170 Parasite of the Army Worm from one to six on the upper side of the body From these caterpillars he bred fiftyfour Tachinas and only two moths Such is the effective warfare waged upon one insect by an other In this way the balance of nature is preserved As to their mode of attack he states that Jefferson Russell an intelligent farmer had repeatedly on damp cloudy morn nings watched a large bluish green fly about the size of a blowfly attacking the army worm and depositing its eggs on the shoulders of the victim as he ascertained by a 28 DiSECTS OF THE FIELD 221 double lens As they were attacked the army worms kept dropping to the ground and gathering in clusters or hiding under clods until finally the wheat on which they occurred was entirely free from them The Army worm of the south or cotton worm is quite a different sort of caterpillar from its northern namesake It loops in its gait and may thus be distinguished from the boll worm also found upon the cotton Its body Fig 171 moth and larva natural size egg much enlarged is rather thick in the middle tapering towaixls both ends and it is green covered with short hairs and dotted with black along a yellowish line situated on each side of the back and with black dots beneath The moth fig ni is reddish brown the wings quite free from the markings usual in the group to which it belongs the fore wings are triangular with two indistinct dark zig zag lines with a conspicuous dark spot near the centre of the wing in the middle of which are two white dots She lays from four to six hundred low flattened greenish eggs ornamented with vertical ribs placing them upon the under side of the leaf In from two to ten days the young worms hatch and begin to feed on the pulpy portion of the leaf but as they grow larger they devour the entire leaf as well as the buds and blossoms During their life as cater pillars which only lasts from fifteen to twenty days they cast tlieir skins five times As regards the habits of the cotton worm I cannot do better than to quote from Mr Rileys second Report on the Noxious Insects of Missouri in which he says that there are three different broods of worms during the year the first appearing in June or July and the last which does the most damage appearing in 29 Cotton Worm egg and moth 222 August or September or even later Mr Lyman in the little work already referred to says That nature has made no provisions by which either the fly the worm the chrysa lis or the eggs can survive the winter or exist for any length of time where the cotton plant is not a perennial But this is surely an error which Mr Lyman would never have made had he possessed a better knowledge of insect life and as Mr Glover found that the chrysalis was killed by the slightest frost the insect evidently winters over in the moth state as do many others belonging to the same tribe Mr W B Seabrook gives strong evidence that this is the case in a Memoir on the Cotton Plant read in 1843 before the State Agricultural Society of South Carolina wherein he says That the Cotton Moth survives the winter is nearly certain An examination of the neighboring woods espe cially after a mild winter has often been successfully made for that purpose And Dr Phares states positively that the moth hibernates in piles of cotton seed under shelter under bark and in crevices of trees in dense forests and other secluded places and that it may often be seen on pleasant days in winter While this worm is young and small it does not seem to attract attention but early in the autumn it suddenly be comes abundant and at certain years extremely destructive One of these visitations which fell under the observation of the eminent botanist Professor J Darby of Auburn Ala bama is thus described in a letter to the writer Saturday September 19th I was in the field examining the forms buds before flowering and the young bolls fruit after the floral organs have fallen off I examined all carefully with no signs of eggs or worms On Sunday I did not see it On Monday I passed it as usual and observed nothing unusual On Tuesday morning I passed it and noticed nothing unusual On Tuesday noon every plant in the field was stripped of all its upper leaves not one remaining as far as could be seen and the plants were covered with mil lions of worms I counted on one plant fortysix worms They commence at the top of the plant eating every leaf When the leaves were gone they attacked the young bolls eating through the perianth and consuming the young cot ton In the course of four days the work was done They did not touch the grape or any other plant in the field so far as I have been able to see Many left the field and thousands were in the road and on the fences but not one in a thousand thus escaped Today September 23d there is scarcely one to be seen Their disappearance is as mys terious as their coming They have left no signs that I can see either on the stalks or in the ground They have ex tended over hundreds of miles and nothing has proved a barrier to them having been as destructive on islands in the river as elsewhere Onethird of the cotton crop has been destroyed Nothing of the kind has occurred in thirty years past to my knowledge After the caterpillar has become fully grown it draws a leaf around it and then changes to a chrysalis It remains in this state for one or two weeks when the moth escapes In dealing with this insect the only practicable way to diminish its powers of doing mischief is for all the cotton planters to combine and employ handpicking looking over the leaves for the eggs when the moths lay them and again picking off the worms when they are detected The use of carbolic acid cresylic soapsuds and other washes have been recommended This insect seems to appear wherever cotton is raised It is very destructive in the West Indies and in South Amer ica and either this or a similar insect occurs in Egypt It is also sometimes found in New York and I have taken several specimens late in the summer on an island in Salem harbor Massachusetts Mr Grote thinks that away from the Gulf States the whole brood dies every year and that 31 224 the caterpillars of the next summer come from eggs laid by moths which have flown north from the Gulf States This is not however in accordance with the habits of moths gen erally and we shall expect to find that the moth winters over in the middle and northern states where it is a straggler as well as in the southern states It will be interesting to know on what plant the caterpillar feeds north of the cotton states The boll worm Fig 172 moth and larva is more like the cut worm in appearance It feeds on the boll of the cotton plant the moth laying her eggs singly up to the num FlG 172 Boll Worm and Larva ber of five hundred on the calyx of the plant The cater pillars appear in three or four days They pierce through the calyx and destroy the flower buds When fully fed it makes an oval cocoon just under the surface of the soil where it iemains in the pupa state three or four weeks There are two broods of this worm in the Middle States « three in Geoigia The last

the richest assemblage of insect forms in the world Their number and beauty diminish as we go north or south Luxuriance of forests with great heat and moisture produces the widest diversity of forms and richness of hues A large proportion of the insects sent home by collectors from tropical coun tries are the butterflies and large showy moths with boring beetles the Scarabeids preying on rotten

in the intelligent care of her replanted forests How carefully the trees are nur tured how intelligently their diseases are studied and with what pains the habits and forms of the destructive insects

forethought of the people who encourage by their patronage the publication of such expensive and 228 richly illustrated works Such a work as that of Ratzeburg entitled Animals Injuring Forests has a double value Not only is it of high practical importance but the minute information therein contained regarding the habits of the destructive insects and their many parasites the relation of the trees

theoretical points in biology such as the supposed struggle for existence in organized beings the origin of sports strains races varie ties and species which combine to lend the highest interest to such stores of facts as are to be found in the works of this learned German Let us now walk through the pine woods and notice the work of some of the more remarkable insects I could take the reader by a favorite walk in the pine woods of Maine and show him among a splendid growth of tall straight white pines one enormous tree whose girth twenty feet from the ground is between fifteen and twenty feet Above that the trunk divides into four branches curved outwards at their base forming a double crotch In another walk I could show him several large trees all within a few rods of each other variously gnarled and distorted either with single curved trunks or double or tripleheaded monsters specimens of vegetable monstrosities which would delight a Geoffrey St Hilaire or Dareste What is the origin of this deformation It is a common little weevil which has the habit of laying its eggs late in the spring in the terminal shoots of white pine bushes Sev eral grubs hatch out and burrow in various directions under the bark As they grow apace they sink into the wood as far as the pith and by the end of the second summer according to Professor Peck as quoted by Harris they have each made a little cell in the wood cleverl lined with pine 4 INSECTS OF THE FOREST 229 chips in which the grub changes into a chrysalis It is easy to find a stem of the pine containing a dozen or more of these cells situated at quite regular intervals under the bark now loosened or peeling off If we examine it in the autumn we shall find the grubs their pupa3 or chrysalides together with the beetles The accompanying excellent figures 174 of the pine weevil its young and chrysalis or pupa the two latter magnified three times will give an ex cellent idea of the different stages of growth of this weevil The footless grub is white with a honeyyellow head The white pupa has a mummified look with its eyes partially concealed by its wings and its legs folded on its breast In this attitude it lies in its cell or sarcophagus awaiting the Fig 174 Piuc Weevil a grub b pupa dawn of a new life in the outer world It either presses out from under the bark and seeks some other hiding place or lies in its cell until some warm day in April when with a troop of its fellows it flies about in the sunshine busied with the care of providing for the continuance of its race Now this work of tunnelling and mining causes the death of the terminal shoot of the young tree The bush sends out lateral shoots more or less ciooked One can see plenty of them in the course of any walk in the edges of the woods Thus deprived of flieir leading shoot such dwarfed and gnarled bushes grow up and vastly injure the appearance of the forest and its value as lumber Dr Fitch says that young thriftygrowing pines are its favorite resort and among these it selects those that are most vigorous and whose topmost shoot has made the great est advance the preceding year But I have seen it so nu merous that not only the topmost shoots of every tree in the grove but many of the lateral ones also were invaded and destroyed by it The tree that is attacked con tinues its growth upward during the fore part of the season as usual sending out from the summit of the shoot that is infested a leading shoot with a number of lateral branches around its base But the growth of these new succulent twigs is arrested and they begin to wilt and wither about the middle of July the worms having by this time become so large and mined and wounded the stalk below to such an extent that its juices are exhausted and it fails to transmit any nourishment to these tender green shoots at the summit which consequently dry up and perish Here again the forester is aided by his best ftiends the birds which pick out the grubs and eat them There are also several parasitic insects which further reduce their ranks Another pine weevil equally abundant and often as de structive is the Hylobius It is a larger beetle and darker less reddish than the white pine weevil Pissodes strobi It is particularly destructive to the pitch pine so much so in the southein states that Wilson the ornithologist thus speaks of its depredations near Charleston South Carolina as quoted by Harris Would it be believed that the larvifi of an insect or no larger than a grain of rice should silently and in one season destroy some thousand acres of pinetrees many of them from two to three feet in diameter and a hundred and fifty feet high Yet whoever passes along the high road from Georgetown to Charleston in South Carolina about twenty miles

their wintrylooking arms and bare trunks bleaching in the sun and tumbling in ruins before every blast presenting a friglitful picture of desolation Until some etfectual preventive or more com plete remedy can be devised against these insects and their larvaB I would humbly suggest the propriety of protecting and receiving with proper feelings of gratitude the services of this and the whole tribe of woodpeckers letting the odium of guilt fall to its proper owners Not remotely allied to the weevils which are distinguished by their more than Roman noses are the little snubnosed cylindrical timber beetles Their hard bodies short legs and strong jaws admirably adapt them for boring in the bark and solid wood of trees They are some Fig 15 times called woodengravers They may well be styled animated gimlets as they bore straight even and true holes as if driven by the hand of a carpenter There are several species which have different modes of assault Tlie first is the Tomicus xylo graphus Fig 175 the true wood engraver It is quite small chestnutcolored about a line in length its wingcovers are bevelled off at the tip the edges of the declivity being armed with four or five teeth on each side The female mines the outer surface of the sap wood and inner layer of the bark lengthwise to the tree Curi ously enough there are more males than females and they help their partners each working in turn This is one of the few cases among insects in which the two sexes unite in the work of providing for the welfare of their future offspring The female is said by Dr Fitch from whose admirable observations I am compiling this account to make little notches at intervals along the burrow In each of these notches from one to four eggs are placed As the beetles 7 232 HALP HOURS WITH INSECTS clothed with the short stiff hairs which cover their bodies pass backwards and forwards in their burrow they brush the dust and chips into the notches thus covering the eggs up When they hatch the young grubs gnaw their way straight out for two or three inches from the primary tunnel which may be from four to eight inches in length It has been noticed that the burrows are alwa3s separate never touching or crossing each other When about to pupate i e change to a pupa the grub sinks deep into the wood at the outer end of the burrow This species attacks the pine wdien in perfect health Another wood engraver nearly two lines in length is the Tomicus cdlligraphus It makes short large irregular bur rows and is common in the yellow pines of the Carolinas as well as the pitch pine of the northern states The burrow of the Tomicus pini is like a birds claw or the fingers of a hand As the beetle is a line and a half in PiQ 170 length its burrows are rather II I I f I I f I Iisfi than usual i i The smallest form known is Tunnel of Timber Beetle TomicuS pusillus slightly more than half a line in length It mines extremely fine slender wavy passages in every di rection mostly in the wood The eggs are laid so that the 3oung grubs mine outwards travelling awaj from each other In the bark beetles there are several males to one female at work in a mine We now come to the true timber beetles which sink their tunnels deep into the wood Here the fe males are most numerous and are probably not aided in their work by the males The Tomicus materarius is aline and a half long and red dish3ellow in color It makes a straight burrow with regu lar secondary tunnels running out at right angles to the main one somewhat as in Fig 176 Its presence may be known by the clean white piles of borings it throws out of its hole Tackard INSECTS or TIIE FOREST 233 Fig 177 Fig 178 Wine cask borer enlarged Chrysobothris larva Fig 179 Avery slender form is the wine cask borer Fig 177 which

abundant these insects may become a piece of elm three feet long bored by the Scolrtus destructor of Europe was estimated to have contained 280000 larviie while the Tomicus monographus which does much mischief by drilling holes in maltliquor casks in India has been thought to bore as tr J many as 134000 holes in the staves form ing a single cask These little beetles when soft flesh grubs are attacked by multitudes of the young of carnivorous beetles such as Staphylinus and Hister and their allies Often in walking through the woods ones attention is attracted by large flakes of bark peeling off the trunks of pines They are loosened by the gnawing teeth of grubs such as are figured here Fig 178 a Chrysobothris larva and 179 9 A giant borer natural size the larva of Euchroma columbica from Central America It Avill be noticed that the body is broad and flattened just behind the hard horny head while behind the en largement the body becomes narrow and cylindrical It thus bores broad shallow grooves between the bark and the solid wood consuming the sap wood the vital part of the tree Our largest and most abundant borer of this group is the Chalcophora Virginiensis It is an inch or more in length the body rough and hard and dark steel brown with a brassy or coppery hue It may be observed flying about on hot days in May and June or sunning itself on the trunks of pine trees The grub forms a long shallow groove more or less ser pentine in its course As the young borer grows its track increases in width which is stufled with chips finely packed behind it Finally when fully grown and ready to transform it bores a large oval hole deep in the wood where the insect reposes during its pupal sleep The insect lives one year as a larva Another species C liberta is rather smaller but very similar to the Virginian Chalcopliora and when at rest resembles the young fruit cones The beetle itself eats the 3oung buds of the pine Pine saplings are much injured by the larval Chrysobothris which girdles the trunks and branches When passing in our strolls among the pines some vet eran tree whose days of usefulness have departed and which already show signs of deca our ears are often saluted with a harsh creaking noise issuing from the tree The strain is intermittent and sometimes several voices join in a chorus of harsh crepitant sounds It is difficult at first to fix upon the exact site of the choristers but on pulling off a piece of the bark out tumble two or three large shining white worms which tell the story They are the young of the common 10 INSECTS OF THE FOREST 235 pine borer Monoliammus notatus whose creaking noise we often notice in passing by piles of white pine wood and sometimes hear issuing from some chair or table or chest of drawers in Avhich it has remained while they are passing through the saw mill and carpenters shop on their way to the chamber or kitchen Its mysterious creaking noise nat urally occasions a good deal of speculation as to its source One sometimes finds the beetle in sawn and planed lumber lying in its cell or it may issue from the leg of a table or bureau drawer with its long legs and horns like a ghost from another world when its advent causes nearly as much of a flutter in the heart of the housekeeper as would the ap pearance of a veritable spirit I have found these larvae in July in abundance when they were a little over an inch long and had apparently com pleted their first year I was unable to find any beetles or ehrsalides and am disposed to think that they produced the noise by rubbing their hard smooth horny heads or jaws against the sides of their burrow Dr Fitch however states that the beetle itself makes the noise and it is evi dent that both larva and beetle produce a similar sound I will quote his statement entire On a still summers night the peculiar grating or crunching noise which the larvoe make in gnawing the wood may be distinctly heard at a distance of eight or ten rods That the insect does not open a passage out of the wood whereby to make its exit until it attains its perfect state I infer from tlie fact that several of these leetles gnawed their way out of one of the pillars of the portico of a newly built house in my neighbor hood some years since the noise being heard several days before they emerged and whilst tliey were still at some dis tance in the interior of the wood The grub is nearly cylindrical white and soft with nu merous fine reddish hairs The second segment of the body is flattened and larger than the others the succeeding rings 11 236 HALF HOUBS WITH INSECTS are very short with a transverse oval rough space in the middle of the upper and under side of the body Its burrow is large and winds around under the bark finally sinking into the wood where the grub undergoes its transformations into a beetle which has remarkably long feelers and is of a granite gray color By its habit of tun nelling logs it is an annoying insect to lumberers who remove the bark from the logs in order to free the wood from its attacks Similar to this beetle with antennae twice as long as its body is a beautiful olive green species with a white spot on Fig 180 Orthosoma grub with heid and thoracic Iings enlarged the scutel at the base of the wingcovers It ma be seen flying about white pine bushes in June when it lays its eggs It is

whose grub may often 12 rSECTS or the forest 237 be found in rotten pine stumps The beetle itself occasion ally enters our houses at night Pine stumps are excellent breeding places for this and the borer of the large black Prionns beetle Fig 181 beetle and pupa which occasion ally leaves its native pine and cuts down our young plums pear trees and grape vines As an example how forest insects may by their widespread ravages change the entire appearance of a landscape I may cite the case of the injury committed one season in a growth of young pine saplings or rather bushes about six Fig 181 Prionus and pupa feet high For several square miles their tops had turned yellow as if they were dying at the roots But near the tops were exudations of pitch forming large masses On cutting these off a little caterpillar was found in a hole be neath the pitch and this was without much doubt the secret of the mischief It seemed at the time impossible for one or two little caterpillars to do such injury to a large and flourishing bush I have not since seen such an unusual fatality in joung pitch pines nor this caterpillar and am now inclined to think that the mischief was produced by the 13 238 little caterpillar the more since similar damage is caused to pine bushes in Europe by a little Tortrix with similar habits A not uncommon sight in isolated pine trees is a nest of sawfly caterpillars whose sawdustlike castings form a large mass collected among the leaves These false caterpillars as they are called are social and live huddled up together on the end of a pine branch Small trees are often ruined by them It always seems as if artificially planted forests suflTer the most from the attacks of injurious insects One of these saw flies before unknown to science has been found ravaging a plantation of young pitch pines on Cape Cod By means of the sawlike ovipositor these curious flies are able to cut slits in the leaves and stems of plants The present species Lophyrus pinirigidi thus slits and inserts an Qgg in each side of the needle of the pine The males are easily distin guished from all otlier sawflies by the beautifully pectinated antennae and shining black bodies We could go on describing the insects injurious to our pine trees but the enumeration would be tedious to the reader About a hundred different species are known to prey on our native pines and a number of them attack the imported ornamental pines and flrs of our lawns They attack the roots the trunk the leaves and the seed in the cones M Perris a French naturalist has written an ex tensive work on the insects of the maritime pine of France describing with care a hundred species found on that tree alone and not only the destructive kinds but all the nu merous parasitic and carnivorous forms which take up their abode beneath the bark of the tree and wage a ceaseless warfare against the primitive occupants If au one would like to look behind the scenes and witness the struggle for existence going on under the bark of a pine tree let him go to the woods for himself and study the various insects in 14 ESTSECTS OF THE EOREST 239 eluding many spiders mites and thousandlegs which con gregate in these retreats Now turning our steps towards tlie hard wood growths we shall find that the oak harbors a great number of insect inhabitants We could enumerate from thirty to forty dif ferent kinds injurious to the oak in tlie northern states The walnut is infested by a still larger number fully seventy species The elm struggles against the attacks of about twentyfive diflTerent kinds while the locust and maple have a less number of species specially injurious The oak suffers from the attacks of numerous gallflies which not content with deforming the branches and leaves With unsightly tumois sting even the roots producing excres cences like ground nuts on the smaller rootlets These little root gallflies are wingless and look lilie little black ants They are strange to sa found only early in winter on the snow They are rare and more curious than destructive If one will examine a pile of freshly cut red oak wood he will find the sticks of cord wood pretty thoroughlj riddled with large holes and tunnels nearly half an inch in diame ter This is the work of a large fleshy caterpillar the young of the Cossus It is the most destructive of all the insects feeding upon the oak as after the worm is hatclied and there are a good many of thom since tlie female lays about three hundred eggs they bore directly into the heart of the tree leaving a passage for the rain and moisture which aid iu the work of destruction The caterpillar is thought to be three years in attaining its full size its life being an unusually long one as few caterpillars are known to live longer than one season It also infests the locust tree If a favorite shade tree has been attacked the best way to prevent farther mischief is to soap the trunk in June and July and thus prevent the moth from depositing its eggs or after the holes appear to plug them up in order to keep the water out 15 240 HALF HOURS WITH LNSECTS Another borer is the Brenthian weevil Eupsalis miniita Fig 182 By means of its long snout armed with short stout jaws at the end it bores a hole through the bark in serts an egg and the grub hatching out bores into the solid wood finally making a burrow about a tenth of an inch in diameter Mr Riley has described and figured in his Sixth Report on the Noxious Insects of Missouri the transformations of this interesting beetle He draws attention to the combative nature of the males in the following words The males of the Brenthians are known to fight desperately for the female and as it has been remarked by Mr A R Wallace it is interesting as bearing on the question of sexual selection F G 182 case as in the stag beetles when the males fight together they should not only be better armed but also much larger than the females The eggs are deposited during the months of May and June and perhaps later the female boring a cylindrical hole with her slender snout and therewith pushing her egg to Eupsalis jg bottom of the hole as is the habit of all snout beetles Mr Howard thus describes his own observations on these insects It requires about a day to make a punc ture and deposit the egg During the time the puncture is being made the male stands guard occasionally assisting the female in extracting her beak this he does by stationing himself at a right angle with her body and by pressing his heavy prosternum against the tip of her abdomen her stout forelegs serving as a fulcrum and long body as a lever When the beak is extracted the female uses her antennae for freeing the pinchers or jaws of bits of wood or dust the antennae being fuinished with stitf hairs and forming an excellent brush Should a strange male approach a heavy contest at once ensues and continues until one or the other The Malay Archipelago p 482 is thrown from the tree The successful party then takes his station as guard These contests sometimes last for hours and are always repeated if the pioper male is defeated though not often if he is successful I think it is by mere happen so that the stranger passes by or runs across the busy couple and if successful in routing his rival he takes the same care of the female as did the vanquished indi vidual The habits of these insects are much like those of the Curculio family When disturbed they fold themselves up as well as they can and drop to the ground where they Fig 183 Oak weevil and young feign death They will soon come to and hide beneath pieces of bark stones or other rubbish Curculiolike Another weevil which may be found in all its stages of larva pupa and adult early in May under the bark of decay ing oaks is the fagdalinus olyra Fig 183 a larva pupa enlarged tluee times The most interesting and intelligent of all the borers is the oak Pruner Stenocorus putator Fig 184 a larva b pupa lying in its hole The ectle appears in June and deposits its eggs near the axilla of a leaf stalk or small twig or in the bark of larger branches The grub hatches and sinks into the centre of the twig Now comes the strange part of its history in which this grub evinces a most unusual trait in these boring insects When lialf grown it nearly cuts the brancli off It then withdrawsPackakd into the hole in the portion of the branch beyond the cut and plugs up the opening behind it before the limb is broken off by some strong wind and falls to the ground But as I am alread indebted to Dr Fitch for most of the facts regarding this intelligent insect I will let him tell them in his own words The worm being about half grown is now ready to cut the limb asunder But this is a most nice and critical oper ation requiring much skill and calculation for the limb Fig 184 h Oak Pruner must not break and fall whilst he is in the act of gnawing it apart or he will be crushed by being at the point where it bends and tears asunder or will fall from the cavity there when it breaks open and separates To avoid such casual ties therefore he must after severing it have time to with draw himself back into his hole in the limb and plug the opening behind him before the limb breaks and falls And this little creature accordingly appears to be so much of a philosopher as to understand the force of the winds and their action upon the limbs of the tree so that he can bring them into his service He accordingly severs the limb so far that it will remain in its position until a strong gust of wind strikes it whereupon it will break off and fall But the most astonishing part of this feat remains to be 18 ESrSECTS OF TIIE FOREST 243 noticed The limb which he cuts off is sometimes only a foot in length and is consequently quite light sometimes ten feet long loaded with leaves and very heavy A man by carefully inspecting the length of the limb the size of its branches and the amount of foliage growing upon them could judge how far it should be severed to insure its being afterwards broken by the winds But this worm is impris oned in a dark cell only an inch or two long in the interior of the limb How is it possible for this creature therefore to know the length and weight of the limb and how far it should be cut asunder A man moreover on cutting a number of limbs of different lengths so far that they will be broken by the winds will find that he has often miscalcu lated and that several of the limbs do not break off as he designed they should This little Avorm however never makes a mistake of this kind If the limb be short it severs all the woody fibres leaving it hanging only by the outer bark If it be longer a few of the woody fibres on its upper side are left uncut in addition to the bark If it be very long and heavy not more than threefourths of the wood will be severed Having cut the limb asunder so far that he supposes it will break with the next wind which arises the worm with draws himself into his burrow and that he may not be stunned and drop therefrom should the limb strike the earth with violence when it falls he closes the opening behind him by inserting therein a wad formed of elastic fibres of wood He now feeds at his leisure upon the pith of the main limb hereby extending his burrow up this limb six or twelve inches or more until he attains his full growth quietly awaiting the fall of the liml and his descent therein to the ground It is quite probable that he does not always sever the limb sufficiently in the first instance for it to break and fall Having cut it so much as he deems prudent he with draws and commences feeding upon the pith of the limb 19 244 above the place where it is partially severed until a high wind occurs If the limb is not hereby broken as soon as the weather becomes calm he very probably returns and gnaws off an additional portion of the wood repeating this act again and again it may be until a wind comes which accomplishes the desired result And this serves to explain to us why it is that the worm severs the limb at such an early period of his life For the formidable undertaking of cutting asunder such an extent of hard woody substance we should expect he would await till he was almost grown and had attained his full strength and vigor But by entering upon this task when he is but half grown he has ample opportunity to watch the result and to return and perfect the work if he discovers that his first essay fails to accom plish the end he has in view Thus the first part of the life of this worm is passed in a small twig branching off from the main limb This is so slender and delicate that on being mined as it is by the worm and all its green outer end consumed it dies and be comes so decayed and brittle that it is usually broken off when the limb falls whereby it has escaped the notice of writers hitherto The remainder of his larval life is passed in the main limb first cutting off this limb sufficiently for it to break with the force of the winds and then excavating a burrow upwards in the centre of the limb both before and after it has fallen to the ground feeding hereon until he has grown to his full size Fitch adds that not only the limbs but small joung trees at least of the white oak are sometimes felled by these insects in which cases the worm instead of cutting the wood off transversely severs it in a slanting or oblique direction as though it were aAvare the winds would prostrate a perpendicular shoot more readily by its being cut in this manner The larvo3 become fully grown in the autumn and some 20 INSECTS OF THE FOEEST 245 change to pupoe in the autumn while others wait till the fol lowing spring The beetle appears in June Now in the remarkable habits of these insects we find a variation in their mode of working corresponding to some difTerence in the size and nature of the branch in which they live This is something quite different from the blind unva rying instinct usually ascribed by the unthinking to the lower animals The oak pruner selects a fitting place in which to la its eggs and because it does so for generation after generation no one can deny that there was not a time when this habit was in process of formation and gradually established after a course of experiments continued through perhaps many generations Again the borer itself is not entirely the creature of circumstances there is some room left for the exercise of what we may call judgment The incision it makes in the branch varies in depth with the size of the branch and it must exercise a certain be it a mini mum amount of reason to adjust its life vvith the ph3sical forces about it in order that the life of the species may be maintained Doubtless it makes many mistakes many branches falling too soon or not falling at all many deaths occurring from these mistakes Unfavorable seasons calm weather a too dry or too moist atmosphere its parasites all conspire to reduce its numbers and render its struggle for bare existence exceedingly precarious But this is the history of every species of animal The life of each species is a record of mistakes and disease and often death in con sequence of those mistakes And turning to the human species the philosophic historian of his race is forced to confess that it is often by their misfortunes that races as well as individuals of marked individualism have moulded their characters We submit then that these unusual instinctive acts of the oak pruner have been in all probability gradually acquired after many trials mistakes and failures until the peculiar habits distinguishing this species from its allies 21 246 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS Fig 185 have become moulded into a comparatively inflexible mode of life when the creature is governed by what commonly goes under the name of instinct a term too frequcntlj used to cover our ignorance and stifle free inquiry into the origin of the different psychological traits of different races of ani mals The leaves of the oak are often ravaged by the young of the sen atorial moth a gayly caparisoned caterpillar with two horns arising directly behind the head It is nearly two inches in length black with four yellow stripes along the back and two on each side It lives in clus ters on the trees some times well nigh

into the wood eject ing the chips and castings through an orifice in the bark Eternal vigilance should be the watchword in dealing with the locust borer Its presence may always be known by the little

pests than any other deciduous tree some seventy species are already known to draw their supply of food from these noble trees Our black walnut wood comes from the western states particularly Indiana

species of this and closely allied beetles in Central and South America we are hardly in a posi tion to deny but that there may be other spe cies with quite similar habits which in their turn may be related to still other forms which may exhibit traits intermediate between the girdler and the average longicorn beetle It is only by comparing the intellectual acts of a long series of closely allied species that we shall be able to ascertain what is excejtional and pos sibly be able to get a glimpse at the origin of such excep tional habits It is for this reason that the study of the habits of

were girdled with a deep notch in such a manner as to induce an observer to believe that the object in view was to kill the branch beyond the notch and extraordinary as it may appear this is actually the fact and the operator is an insect whose instinct was implanted by the Almighty power who created it and under such circumstances that it could never have been acquired as a habit The effect of girdling is unknown to the insect whose life is too short to foresee the necessities of its prog eny during the succeeding season This insect may be seen in Pennsylvania during the two last weeks in August and the first week in September feed ing upon the bark of the tender branches of the young hick ories Both sexes are rather rare particularly the male which is rather smaller than the female but with longer an tennae The female makes perforations in the branches of the tree upon which she lives which are from half an inch to less than a quarter of an inch thick in which she depos its her eggs she then proceeds to gnaw a groove of about a tenth of an inch wide and deep around the branch and below the place where the eggs are deposited so that the exterior portion dies and the larva feeds upon the dead wood and food which is essential to many insects although but few have the means of providing it for themselves or their progeny by an instinct so remarkable Where this insect is abundant it must cause much dam age to young forests of hopholes by the destruction of the principal shoot A wood engraver plies its trade of scoring the trees be neath the bark This is the Scolytus caryce whose habits have been well described by Mr Riley In Illinois during a period of about ten years it destroyed many hundreds of fine young trees Mr Bryant writes that it has sadly thinned my beautiful grove and bids fair to destroy all the 30 PACKAKD INSECTS OF THE EOEEST 255 hickory trees in it Mr Riley adds tlie beetles issue the latter part of June and fore part of July Both sexes bore into the tree the male for food and the female mostly for the purpose of laying her eggs In thus entering the tree they bore slantingly and upward and do not confine them selves to the trunk but penetrate the small branches and even the twigs The entrance to the twig is usually made at the axil of a bud or leaf and the channel often causes the leaf to wither and drop or the twig to die or break off The female in depositing confines herself to the trunk or larger limbs placing her eggs each side of a vertical cham ber as described by Mr Bryant Here she frequently dies and her remains may be found long after her progeny have commenced working The larvae bore their cylindrical chan nels at first transversely and diverging but afterward lengthwise along the bark always crowding the widening burrows with their powdery excrement which is of the same color as the bark The fullgrown larva is soft 3cllowish and without trace of legs The head is slightly darker with brown jaws and the stigmata so pale that they are with dif ficulty discerned It remains torpid in the winter and transforms to the pupa state about the end of the following May The pupa is smooth and unarmed and shows no sex ual differences The perfect beetle issues through a hole made direct from the sapwood and a badly infested tree looks as though it had been peppered with No 8 shot The sexes differ widely from each other the male having spines on the truncated portion of the abdomen not possessed by the female The eggs are deposited during the months of August and September and the transformations are effected within one year as no larvjc will be found remaining in the tree the latter part of July The chestnut tree is sometimes infested by the Shining Arrhopalus Fig 195 Except the fact that it has

blue reflec tions The top of the head and the sides of the prothorax Fig 195 The Shining Arrhopalus and under side of the body are covered with short fine gray hairs and there are silvery wlike markings on the wing covers We have thus seen what a force in the world these beetles are Their work is done slowly but effectively and their gnawing teeth though slow in action are as resistless as the mordant tooth of time Beetles have in fact well earned the right to have engraved on the escutcheon of their order the old saying Scarabceus aquilam qucerit 10 Insects as mimics MAN especially in his savage state is as a rule obliged to vesoit to various subterfuges to provide himself with animal food The hunter tracks his quarry through the woods his dress of hides or his naked skin harmonizing with the dusky hues of the forest his step is wary and light his weapons are noiseless the deer falling dead from his arrow the bird from his blow gun without startling their fellows or he hunts them by traps from behind screens or while hidden by the foliage of trees At times he disguises himself and stalks the deer dressed in the head and skin of one of their ovn kind He mimics their voices calling the moose by means of a birch bark horn and whistling to the woodcock or snipe The civilized sportsman if he would be successful in the chase adapts his hunting suit to the colors of the field or woodland wearing gray or green some color harmonizing with the landscaie through which he ranges Even his pointers or setters are protected by their tanbrown hue lie makes decoy ducks and tolls in a flock of ducks or geese flying overhead or feediug offshore beyond the reach of his gun The fact that birds and quadrupeds are so easily deceived is a good proof that the use of disguises among animals in a state of nature is an actual fact If some birds can be deceived Iy clumsy painted wooden decoys others may mistake a caterpillar for a twig a weevil for a bud or an edible butterfly mimicking one which they gen erally discard as too nauseous to their taste All this mimicry on the part of man is conscious What is often necessary with man is still more essential with animals In the animal world there is an unconscious mim 17 1 258 iciy The manifold disguises are worn unwittingly by the brute the bird or insect or moUusk but there is no less an underlying design in nature and some useful end subserved That everything which exists lias some use in the world may be regarded as an axiom The savage knows that himself and his offspring will starve unless he by strategem and through some disguise can kill his game Unless the insect protects itself from harm b imitating some natural object or other insect whicli enjoys immunity from the enemies pe culiar to the mimic it and its species will die out All the disguises in nature are then for a manifest utilitarian pur pose and we shall see that each species is by some pecu liarity in its form or color or movements at one or another critical period in its life protected and preserved in the struggle for existence It often happens that the weaker species are overlooked by their enemies while on the other hand the predaceous species are as often enabled to approach their prey through the disguise they have assumed But it will be seen that the ultimate fact in this matter of mimicry is as insisted on by Messrs Darwin and Wallace the advantage to the species It will not unlikely occur to the unbiassed reader that the result of this law of mimicry is rather tlie lireservation of forms already established than the origin of new ones I shall assume as true that quadrupeds birds and insects and the lower animals as well are deceived and protected in turn b the disguises thc assume and that the end is a utilitarian one while I disagree with the conclusions of those who believe that species originate from mimicry as suming that if some species owe their preservation to this cause they may have originated from the same natural causes as their unsuccessful fellows whom mimicr or rather the want of it failed to preserve The fossiliferous strata of our globe are filled with the remains of organisms which have perished in unsuccessful attempts to survive in the struggle for life in a vvorlcl existing in a state of constant incquiiihriuni It is the changes in the conditions of life the revolutions in the physical surroundings of organisms which have induced the transformation of one species into another while protective mimicr has often acted as a con servative agency in preserving the species Both sets of causes have then been factors in the origination of animals and plants as we see them and Darwinism is perhaps as essential as Lamarckianism in explaining the present condi tions of life on the globe But to come at once to the subject of protective mimicry we will study in the first place Insects mi7nicking other natural objects The examples under this head illustrate some of those harmonies in nature which the distinguished Bernard de Saint Pierre saw so clearly Tiie adaptive coloration of animals the harmony in tint and form with the trees on which they live or the rocks among or under which they hide the sand over which they run arc a part of the general harmony in nature A desert animal is of a sandy complexion a silkworm moth is brown a grasshopper is duskytfor much the same reason that the grass is green the sky seems blue or the rocks are gray These harmonics in form in color are as striking in the world as a whole as in isolated portions of it or isolated species of the animals or plants growing on its surface These harmo nies extend to other worlds and systems of worlds and are cosmical in their nature So the causes that lead to the origination of life of a new species are perhaps of a piece with tliose resulting in the origin of a planet We must remember that life at first resulted in all probability through the action of cosmical laws Before animals and lants had multiplied to an extent where was the material for the laws of natural selection to act upon There was once a time when some of the mills of the gods failed to run for the reason that there was nothiu to jrrind Tiger Beetle Among the insects adapted by their peculiar style of col oration to live on the sand or soil are the tiger beetles They are most commonly seen running over sands by the river or on the Avarm light colored soil of wood or forest paths The Cicinclela generosa Fig 196 is ornamented more conspicuously than usual with broad light bands and spots It is found on the white sands of Cape Cod and the beaches southward But a more decided case of protective mimicry is the whitebacked tiger beetle Cicindela dormlis Here the wing covers and front of the head cl3pcus are white while the back part of the head and the prothorax are dark so tliat as the beetle lies on the white sand in wait for its prey it would be easily mistaken for a hole or dark spot or pebble On the other hand the bright green six spotted Cicindela C sexguttata is adapted for its life in the grass in which it runs and flies and in its flight would be mistaken by its enemies or victims for a large green fly Miisca vomitoria The beautiful Cicinclela gloriosa of a very deep velvety green color was only taken upon wet mossy stones in the bed of a mountain stream wheie it was with the greatest difficulty detected A large brown species C hems was found chiefly on dead leaves on forest paths and one which was never seen except on the wet mud of salt marshes was of a glossy olive so exactly the color of the mud as only to be distinguished when the sun shone by its shadow Where the sandy beach was coralline and nearly white I found a ery pale Cicindela wherever it was volcanic and black a dark species of the same genus was sure to be met with Wallace The black or reddish ants are protected from observation by their dark colors in climbing the trunks of trees while 4 IACKAitD INSECTS AS MIMICS 261 the smaller lighter species frequent the sandy light paths about our dwellings Within doors the Reduvius Figs 56 57 covers itself with dust a good disguise in approaching its prey and escaping its enemies Ground spiders by their hues simulate the inequalities of the dark soil over which they run The trap door spiders Mygale Fig 62 are col oied like the soil in which they excavate their nests The desert Mantis Erernophila is of a sandy hue and is easily confounded with the sands of the Sahara An example of protective coloration is probably afforded by a moth of the silk worm family Eideucophceus tricolor Fig 197 Avhich inhabits New Mexico Instead of the dark brown hues of its allies it has a faded appearance adapting it for conceal FlG 197 Eulcucoplitcus ment while resting on the dry parched ground It will be interesting to learn whether its exceptional style of color ation adapts it for a life in the deserts of New Mexico Here the change is evidently induced by the dry climate The grasshoppers nearly always harmonize in color with the general hue of the fields in which they abound They are most abundant towards the last of summer when the fields have lost their freshness and the grass has turned brown at this time the russet garb of the Carolinian locust and the redlegged grasshopper admirably conceal them when at rest I have noticed the sulphurwinged grasslK per Arpliid sulphurea flying about dry hillsides and in northern IVIaine the crackling grasshopper Trimerotropis 5 262 Packakd verruculata is especially abundant on burnt lands and ele vated hill tops or in mountain valleys where it harmonizes well with the soil The maritime grasshopper Trimero tropis maritima is lilce the maritime tiger beetle specially adapted for concealment pn thio sea shore as observed by Mr Scudder who says it so closely resembles the color of the sand on a sea beach that it is difficult to see it when alighted It differs remarkably from its inland allies by the white or pale bands and spots How protective mimicry may affect the different species of a genus is shown in the common redlegged grasshoppers The spretus of the west and the femurrubriwi of the east harmonize in color with the brown hues of the grass lands in August and September but the large twobanded one Caloptenus bivittatus so abundant during the same months in our gardens in its green coat with yellow stripes agrees with the green and 5ellow tints of our garden vegetables among the leaves of which it lives From its comparatively sedentary habits it grows larger and much more clumsy than its lean and agile congeners There are numberless little froth or spittle insects such as the green Helochara communis and the russet Ptyelus Uneatris our commonest spittle insect which pass their youth in concealment in masses of froth on the stems of grass in June These masses of bubbles would be easily mistaken for drops of dew or at least not suspected of con taining any living beings The bright peagreen leaf hopper abounds late in summer with others of its ilk in the highly colored grasses of damp places which retain their freshness late in the autumn On the other hand the Ptyelus in its brown dress harmonizes with the hues of the upland fields which have turned brown by the summer droughts Many other hemipterous insects however gayly colored after they fly about in their early wingless stages are green like the herbage in which they hide The common squash bug is of the exact color of the garden soil it is only seen about the roots of the plant near the ground while the little yellow beetle Fig 199 is a frequent visitor of the yellow flowers Among the moths which hide on the surface of the ground or in the grass are the numerous species of owlet moths Noctuidic The Agrotis and Mamestra and many others of this family as caterpillars show many pecu jg liar adaptations in color to the soil on which they live The dusk livid cut worms would be easily overlooked as the crawl over the soil when disturbed from their retreats under sticks and stones They move about at night and nocturnal insects are usually dull colored On the other hanl the pretty green cinnamon ° hiiiuish Bug spotted Leitosia L concinnimacula flies by day in the short grass When the larger dull brown moths such as that of the army worm of the north are disturbed they quickly dart into the dry rusty stubble and it is almost impossible to detect them if they remain quiet as they often have the instinct to do when an enemy is close at hand Lichencovered rocks are frequented by certain moths and Fig 190 butterflies which aflord some of the most remark pw Jille cxamiles of protective coloring I have ever V observed This is particularly noticeable in Arc vIliK tic and Alpine Lepidoptera The cranberry fields and barren moors of Labrador abound in little Squash gjjy jjjj imj colored leafrolling moths which Beetle o 7 are impossible to detect until the are startled Some geometrid moths are called carpet moths in England from the large number observed carpeting the lichen and mossgrown rocks of the hills of Scotland I have captured within an hours time as many as seventyfive of the Polar Glaucopter3x on Table Rock at the mouth of the Straits of Belle Isle As they rested on the lichened rocks it was 7 2G4 extremely difficult to detect them so well did their pepper andsalt and greenish hues agree with the gray and green rocks On another occasion while entomologizing on some peculiar light gneiss rocks overgrown witli gray lichens a couple of hundred miles farther north on the Labrador coast I found it impossible to detect the Anartas though resting almost under my feet so closely did these owlet moths re semble the rocks over which I clambered Again on the hills above the Moravian settlement of Hopedule thousands of the beautiful duntinted Chionobas of different species fluttered feebly over the lichenclad rocks the underside of their wings corresponding exactly in color with the ground Fig 200 Fig 201 tinonobaa Buiiiidia Grapta progne on which they rested This scene is iepeated on that bit of Arctic landscape the extreme summit of Mt Washington where the Chionobas semidia Fig 200 from Tennoys Zool ogy occurs as well as in other Alpine peaks of Europe and the Rocky Mountains A georaetrid moth Marmopteryx strigularla which inhabits the mountainous regions of the eastern states from Vermont to AVest Virginia has the same peculiar marbled under surface of the hind wings and also an allied species found in the Sierra Nevada The under side of the Grapta butterflies Fig 201 Grapta progne right side have the color of dead leaves and as they sit in paths with their wings folded over their backs would Packakd INSECTS AS MIMICS 265 be readily mistaken for a dead leaf All these Graptas with Vanessa Antiopa are among the most abundant of our but terflies The most perfect resemblance to a leaf with its stalk is afforded by the well known case of the Kallima figured and described by Mr Wallace in his interesting book entitled The Malay Archipelago The caterpillars which feed on herbage or the leaves of trees are almost universally protected from the attacks of birds by their adaptive coloration Those caterpillars which feed on the pines have a family look though belonging to Fig 202 Fig 203 m Pine Lyda Honeysuckle Abia different natural families For example the larva of the Eu ropean pine Fidonia our native Cleora of the pine the pine Trachea the iine hawk moth EUema and other caterpillars have markings very much in common having as a ground color the peculiar green of fresh pine needles with red stripes and bars corresponding in tone to the red sheaths of the needles The leaves of the Austrian iine are devoured by a saw fly larva Lyda Fig 202 which is reddish olive green with reddish and purple patches and lines The Abia jf the Tartarean honeysuckle Fig 203 is of a peculiar 9 266 pale bluish green color somewhat resembling the peculiar glaucous green hue of the leaf on which it feeds It is gen erally overlooked until the bushes are striped This worm does not seem to be eaten by birds probably on account of the fluid which is suddenly poured out through the pores in the sides of the body when it is disturbed The false cater nillar of the currant saw fly is rarely eaten by birds and enjoys an unusual immunity so also the pear slug Fig 204 perhaps if not on account of its resemblance to a slug for slugs are greedily devoured by birds possibly on Fig 204 Fig 205 Fear Slug Cimbex Larva account of some disagreeable taste The larva of the Cim bex Fig 205 when coiled upon a leaf has a tolerable like ness to the common Helix alholahris Returning again to the grasshoppers the species of the family of Locustarians to which the Katydid belongs are modified for a life hidden among the leaves of trees Nearly all the species are green In their youth tiiey hop about in the grass and are better protected from harm than the young Acrydians which are usually dark though some are green 10 INSECTS AS MIMICS 267 Some species remain in the grass througliout their lives but most of the Katydids and others which produce a loud cry reside in the trees Here it is difficult to detect them their green hues matching so well the hues of the leaves forming their covert Moreover the fore wings are inclined to be broad and oval as seen in those of the Katydid Fig 20G It will be noticed in this insect how closely the veins resem ble those of the leaves There are in the Museum of the Peabody Academy of Science a number of Brazilian species Fig 206 Katydid allied to the Katydid which have very broad thick fore wings some oval in shape like orange or lemon leaves others with jagged outlines somewhat as in the holly leaf Others are of the color of a dead leaf Such is the Cyrto phyllus perspicillatus which bears a close resemblance to a withered leaf There is in Brazil a grasshopper of this fam ily which represents the East Indian Megalodon figured by Wallace on page 5b0 of The Malay Archipelago There are some insects which resemble anything but thera 11 268 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS Packaku selves This paradox may be explained by a glance at a Selandria larva Fig 207 which sometimes occurs on the chestnut Its body is entirely concealed by a cottony secre tion which rises half an inch above the body A group of these sluggish caterpillars could feed exposed on a leaf with impunity The bark lice such as Eriosoma cover them selves with a cottony exudation which serves as a disguise Many bright colored flower beetles are protected by their resemblance to the tints of the flowers in which they hide The Galeruca and Clytus almost invariably found on the golden rod in September are thus protected Why butterflies are so much more commonly seen than their caterpillars is not known It is probabl due to the jjQ 207 latter are often of the color of the leaves on which they feed The caterpillar of the Colias Philodice our common sul phur yellow butterfly which lives on clover is rarely found owing to its peagreen tint so much like Selandria Larva ijt of the clover leaf on which it feeds It is possible that the caterpillar is so well protected that the butterflies can aftbrd to have their numbers thinned out by predaceous insects and birds So with tlie caterpil lars of the white cabbage butterflies whose dark green vel vety coats so thoroughly assimilate them with cabbage or turnip leaves or stalks The caterpillar of Vanessa Antiopa is one of the most conspicuous objects in nature large clus ters of these black spiny creatures feeding exposed on the leaves of the willow and other plants It is probable how ever that bristling as they are with spines birds do not fancy them but the butterflies as well as the chrysalides assume the tints of dead leaves and old wood and the but terfly may be easily confounded with the trunks of the trees on which it rests as it does not settle on the ground as in 12 INSECTS AS MIMICS 269 the Graptas Mun geometric moths rest on the bark of trees where they eseape the observation of the entomologist whose eye is trained at loolving for them and perhaps also of the birds The white pine trees often shelter the Tcphro sia Canadcuia which I have found in no other position The Red Under wings or Catocalas spend their days on the bark of deciduous trees and only expose themselves to the attack of birds when they show their gorgeous red and yellow hues in flight The Arctian moths so brightly painted with strong con trasts of black and vermilion or red can afford to be snapped up by the birds which allow their spiny hairy larvae to go scotfree It is possible that the bright colors of the Arc tians and other Bombycidj as well as the butterflies are needed to ensure the meeting of the sexes as by their bright colors they can detect each other afar off though the acute sense of smell possessed by these moths whose antennae are broadly pectinated may be sufficient for ensuring the prompt recognition of each others presence That the white colors of the Spilosoma Virginica and the moth of the fall web worm Ilyphantria textor serve the same purpose of mutual recognition as the conspicuous white Pieris seems probable Mr Darwin Descent of Man i 387 Apiletons edition 1871 states that the common white butterfly as I hear from Mr Doubleday often flies down to a bit of paper on the ground no doubt mistaking it for one of its own spe cies The owlet and geometrid motlis fly in such large numbers that there is a greater chance of their encountering one another in the night particularly as they feed on com mon objects of attraction i e the honey of flowers But all these points need to be thoroughly investigated Many statements and assertions on the subject of mimicry need reexamination and confirmation and some of the Aicts I give here arc simply hints for future observation and ex periment 13 270 The most wonderful cases of protective mimicry among caterpillars are afforded by the geometrids or spanworms I have never seen a better example than that afforded by the larva of Drepanodes varus Fig 208 which feeds on the Fig 208 Fig 209 Drepanodes and Larva and Pupa Stick Insect juniper It would be difficult in the accompanying figure as well as in life to tell where the caterpillar begins or the juniper twig ends The body of the larva holds itself out stiff and rigid after the manner of its tribe with warts over U INSECTS AS MIMICS 271 its back exactly like tlie leaf scars of the juniper and the entire worm concolorous throughout with the bark is a per fect imitation of the twig Nearly every bush has its distinct kind of inch worm or geometer which resembles a broken branch or twig when it is at rest and holds itself out stiff by its muscular hind legs Most caterpillars remain quiet by da when they need protection and feed at night The stick insect Fig 209 from Tenneys Zoology is so obviously a mimetic form that we need only speculate how it came to differ from its allied forms unless the intermediate forms have become extinct through the want of similar adaptation This and the celebrated leafinsect are the two insects which first come to mind when the subject of mimicry is mentioned The Phyllium is broad and flat with leaflike dilatations on the legs Avhile the broad wings are provided with a midrib and vein exactly like a dried leaf Other remarkable stick insects of the group of Phasmids are figured by Professor Westwood in his Tiiesaurus Euto mologicus Oxoniensis Such as the Extatosoma bufonium from Australia Ileteropteryx Castehiandii from Tringany Malacca and Ceroys laciniatus from Nicaragua They are much alike in form though inhabiting different quarters of the globe and are slender with long legs with flattened tubercles and spiny expansions resembling the young and spiny twigs on which they possibly rest The caterpillars of the leafrolling and Tineid moths often live in rolledup leaves where they are protected in a great measure from their enemies thougli the insec tivorous birds attracted perliaps b the deformation they cause in the foliage feed uiCn them and their insect parasites particularly the minute chalcid flies have the requisite instinct to find them out and oviposit in their bodies No insects hoAvevcr protected by these disguises arc ever thoroughly safe from the attacks of enemies cspe 15 272 TPackare cially created to gain their livelihood by preying upon them One of the most striking cases of mimicry is afforded by the caterpillar of the Tohjje Velleda as avcU as that of its ally the lappet moth which is found on apple trees and would easil when at rest be mistaken for a swelling or can kered spot on the bark Harris Treatise on the Injurious Insects of Mass 1862 p 379 Miss Dix as quoted by Harris on the same page states that when at rest the re semblance of its upper surface was so exact with the young bark of the branch on which it was fixed that its presence might have escaped the most accurate investigation and this deception was the more complete from the unusual shape of the caterpillar which might be likened to the ex ternal third of a cylinder The sides of the body were cloaked and fringed with hairs It was of a pale seagreen color above marked with ash blended into white and beneath of a lrilliant orange spotted with vivid black When in motion its whole appearance Avas changed it ex tended to the length of two inches and twothirds of an inch in breadth its colors brightened and a transverse open ing was disclosed on the back twothirds of an inch from the head of a most rich velvetblack color It was sluggish and motionless during the day and active only at niglit The gray color and roughened surface of many longicorn and Buprestid beetles which rest in the daytime on the bark of trees are undoubtedly protective though why multitudes of these two groups of insects are on the other hand among tlie most highly colored and brilliant of any in exis tence needs further investigation Mr Wallace observes that these brilliant beetles would not be eaten by birds on account of their very hard dense tegument but this will equally apply to the gray and dull colored species which are evidently protected by these adaptive colors The bright colored species are the exception in the temperate regions 16 INSECTS AS MIMICS 273 and more the rule in the hot and moist forests of the tropics Here the ph3sical environment of the animal is nndoubtedly the primary cause of its higli colors The buds of plants and trees are imitated by many kinds of weevils whose oval often rough bodies and sluggish natures protect them Such is the plum weevil Fig 210 which looks like a dried plum bud The small cones of the pine are simulated by the Chalcophora liberta a Buprestid beetle Early in June wlien the brown Elaters are coming out of the ground and are found resting on the low maple bushes I have observed some to resemble closely the long leaf buds of that tree Certain small weevils resemble the seeds of plants AVal FiG 210 ¦ Fig 211 Plum Weevil ami Larva Young Clilaniy and case lace quotes Kirby and Spences statement that the small weevil named Onthojihilus sulcatus looks like the seed of an umlelliferous plant Wallace also quotes Bates as saying that some tropical spiders are exactly like flower buds and take their station in the axils of leaves where they remain motionless waiting for their prej Some beetles like the little tliick rounded oblong Chla mys have been noticed by Bates and also by Wallace to resemble the castings of large caterpillars and the case of the larva of this beetle Fig 211 which is not uncommon in the United States is black and oval in shape and would be readily mistaken for a pellet of birds dung Wal lace quotes the statement of an observer who had more than once mistaken an English moth Cilix compressa a little white and gray moth for a piece of birds dung dropped upon a leaf and vice versa the dung for a 110th Wallace also tells us that there are in the oast small bee tles of the family Buprestidse which generally res ca the midrib of a leaf and the naturalist often hesitates before picking them off so closely do they resemble pieces of birds dung The same might be said of the little dark brownish bronzed Brach3s often seen in midsummer resting motion less on the leaves of the oak Some carrion beetles are dark like the decaying bodies under which they live and so are their larvte but why ether Fig 212 Fig 213 Attageiuis Larva Anthrenus and joung forms like the Necrophori and Necrophili are banded sj conspicuously with red or 3ellow does not seem clear to us Many of the small Catops the Nitidulae the Staphylini are dark red or brown or black these colors harmonizing with the sombre tints of the decaying substances on which they Tve I have noticed that the Antherophagus ochraceus a duix ochreous reddish beetle is uf the same hue as the cells of the humble bee in which they are often

they luxuriate Tlie larvre especially are so densely clothed with gray or reddish brown hairs that it is difficult to detect them when at work in dried insects and bird skins Their stealthy ways also favor their protection and these beetles like the weevils and man others when disiturbed feign death How this mimicry of death so common among insects came to be such a universal habit would form a curious sub ject of inquiry It can scarcely perhaps be regarded as anything more than instinctive in the insects of the present day but in the earlier ages of the world Avhen the insects were schooling themselves in the arts of life such acts as these must have been in a degree conscious and only became habitual after many mistakes and trials resulting in the extinction of many individuals and incipient species When one looks at the beds of fossil beings of the earlier geologic periods he peers into the tombs of millions which could not adapt themselves to their constantly changing surroundings No fossil being is known to us which could not have been as well adapted to its mode of life as the animals now living but the conditions of life changed and the species as such could not withstand the possible influx of new forms due to some geological change which induced emigration from adjoining territories or to changes of the contour of the surface with corresponding climatic alterations Let one look at the geological map of North America before the Cretaceous period ere the Rocky Mountains appeared above the sea and reflect on the remarkalle changes that took place to the northward the disappearance of an Arctic continent the replacement of a tropical climate in Green land and Spitzbergen by Arctic cold Are there not here changes enough in the phjsical aspects of our country to warrant such hypotheses of migrations with corresponding 19 276 extinctions and creations of new faunas out of preceding ones as are indulged in by naturalists of tlie present day in the light of the knowledge pouring in upon them from Arctic explorers and western geologists Granted these extraordi nary changes in the phjsical surroundings of the animals whose descendants people our land do not a host of ques tions arise as to the result in the beings of our day of these changes in the modes of life the modes of thought so to speak the formation of peculiar instincts arising from new exigencies of life which have remodelled the whole psychol og as it were of the animals of our country Instincts vary with the varying structure and form of the animals Change the surroundings and at once the mode of life and psjchology of the organism begin to undergo a revolution These changes may result in the gradual extinction of Mhole assemblages of animals which are as gradually replaced by new faunas Many indeed most insects are in our northern hemisphere represented in the colder months of the year by the chrysa lis or eggs These are eagerly sought after by the smaller birds and are in most cases protected by their colors or by their resemblance to the bark of the trees on which they may be laid The eggs of the canker worm are gra like the bark of the tree or paling on which they are deposited The eggs of the tent caterpillar are covered over with a coating of gum so that the bunch looks like an excrescence on the tree The chrjsalis of Vanessa Antiopa is exactly of the color of old wood and it is often found hanging from fences and outhouses while before houses were built for this butterfly belongs to an ancient family it assimilated in hue the bark of trees The cocoons of many of the silk moths like those of the Promethea moth are covered with leaves drawn around them in the process of weaving and hang all winter on the wild cherr having the semblance of a dead leaf Those of the Polyphemus Fig 214 which fall  to tlie ground among the leaves of the oak are covered with dead leaves and the color of the cocoon when bare harmo nizes with that of the soil or leaves Aquatic insects are often nearly colorless like the water they inhabit Many water larvsB are pale green like the plants in which they hide What excellent mimics the cad dis worms and Ranatra and Belostoma are we have previ ously adverted to in the chapter on Insects of the Pond and Stream To the cases there given might be added certain sluggish larvaB like Psephenus Fig 215 and others which Fig 2U Fig 215 Cocoon of the American Silk Worm Psephenus adhere to the under side of pebbles and are thoroughly as similated in color to the mud of streams and the shores of the sea Much light may be thrown upon this subject by a study of cave animals Here the harmony in color and often in form to surrounding objects is most striking and the causes are quite apparent The cave insects becoming blind from the darkness of their subterranean abode lose their colors and are assimilated to the colors of the stalactites on which they walk or the walls of the cave to which they cling The ground beetles instead of being dark like their outofdoor relations here fade out to the color of the limestone sands over which they run The hurmon in form and color with the environments of their subterranean abode is as apparent as tlio cause All the cases hitherto given are examples of unconscious mimicry and in man if not most cases the effect of cli matic and other physical causes resulting in a general har mony of hue and form which adapts all animals to the world in which they live But there are a few cases known in which it is difficult not to believe that at some time in the life of the species there was a conscious intention to deceive I refer to the trap door spiders and other forms which curi ously conceal the entiance to their holes with the manifest design of hiding it from their enemies or of using it as an ambuscade I would refer the reader to Moggridges capital work on Harvesting Ants and Trap Door Spiders for much curious and reliable information regarding the habits of these spiders Like our trap door spider Mygale Fig 62 its allies in southein Europe excavate deep tunnels in the earth they seem to take unusual pains to conceal the entrance from their enemies The hole is usually situated in moss and small ferns etc After the door is made the top is actually planted with bits of moss and small plants so that it is often impossible for the practised e3e to detect the trap door Moggridge remaiks that the moss thus transplanted by the spiders grew as vigorously and had in every way the same appearance as that which was rooted in the surrounding earth and so perfect was the deception that I found it impossible to detect the position of the closed trap even when holding it in my hand There can be no doubt that many nests escape observation in this way and the artifice is the more surprising because there is strong reason to believe that this beautiful doorgarden is deliber ately planted with moss by the spider and not the effect of a mere chance growth The evidence he adduces is strongly confirmatory of this view In the nests of other spiders he tells us that it is rare to find any of the larger mosses or lichens growing upon them but as if to compen sate for this deficiency a variety of foreign materials are employed which are scarcely ever found in cork doors such as dead leaves bits of stick roots straw of grasses etc and I have seen freshly cut green leaves apparently gath ered for the purpose spun Fig 210 into a door which had re centl been constructed We have in this coun try a species of Tarantula Lycosa which as if by design covers its hole with a mass of dead and dry leaves as indicated in Fig 2IG after Emer ton In an article in the American Naturalist vol iv Mr Enierton tells us that his attention was drawn to these nests by Mr J A Lintner who noticed on the sandy hills west of Albany N Y a number of holes about half an inch in diameter each surrounded by a ring of sticks and bits of leaves loosely fastened togetlier by fine threads The larvse of Cassida the helmet beetle and Lema which live exposed IW 1 1 i ii Lycosa in it3 nest to the sight of their ene mies on the niper side of loaves arturd examples of what at some period in tlie life of the species may have been a conscious attempt at deception The larva of Cassida is broad flat and oval edged with long sharp spines By 23 280 means of the two long terminal spines terminating its up turned extremity it holds the old cast skin over its body like an umbrella The beetle itself in its resplendent golden hues has been compared by Wallace to glittering dew drops upon the leaves In another form Chelymorpha cri hraria Fig 217 a inpa whicli is considerably larger than Cassida and feeds very much exposed on the silk weed and sometimes on the raspberry is also protected by its cast skin though in a less degree The larva of the common potato beetle of the eastern states Fig 218 a larva c pupa rf eggs covers its dull gray soft body with a black mass of its excrement Fig 217 Fig 218 Helmet Beetle and Pupa Young Potato Beetle which is at once a protection from the heat of the sun and the attacks of birds wiiich probably regard them as any thing but living and edible insects It would seem then that while in the generality of cases insects harmonize in color and often in form with suiTound ing objects or even distinctly mimic natnral objects this is owing in all probability mainly to the physical environment of the animal in a few cases however there is an appear ance of design and natural selection has been the means by which the mimicry has been effected and the species preserved 24 Packakd LNSECTS as MIMICS 281 Mimicry of other Insects We now come to instances wliere insects resemble others of different genera families and orders They are exceedingly numerous and entomolo gists have been familiar with some of them for at least a century Struck with the fact that as a rule the insects which were mimicked were higher in the scale than the mim ickers tlie writer attempted in an essay published in 18G3 to classify some of the known facts adding some supposed to be new and to give a partial explanation of them In the light of the facts published a year previous to this by Mr Batest and afterwards by Mr Wallace J and JMr Darwin § I am inclined to the belief that the resemblance in pattern and color between insects belonging to different groups is probably due to causes more fundamental than natural and sexual selection and reaching possibly farther back in geo logical time I will quote the following passage from my essay If we consider the Hymenoptera Lepidoptera and Dip tera by themselves in the order in which Latreille has placed them we shall find these three groups full of reciprocal anal ogies Certain forms in the one suborder leap over their neighboring suborder to find their analogues in one a tliird removed or again we see analogous forms between the two higher groups leaving the lowest for a while isolated or on the other hand the two lower groups are thus united leaving the highest one standing by itself For example the clear winged Sesia imitates the humblebee in its form and flight the different species of JEgerians Fig 219 yEgeria tipuli Oii Syntlictio Tyies in Insects Journal of the Boston Society of Natural Hi tory 18i3 til W Bates

of nearly every hymenopterous family as we can see when recalling such names as apifor 7nis vespifo7nus pJiilanthiformis tipJiiceformis scoUceformis spheciformis cJirysidiformis cynipidiformis formiciformis icJmeuvionifoimis uroceriformis and tenthredini formis So also other Egerians resemble different famil forms of Dii tera as seen in the names culiciformls tijndiformis bibio foiviis anthraciformis muscceformis etc In the Diptera we find Bombylius resembling as its name implies Bom bus and also Laphria which so closely apes the humblebee in its form coloration size and flight even to the buzz which is if anything still louder Also there is the strong est resemblance in some Syrphi to Vespa and especially to different species of Crabro But while the Lepidoptera and Fig 219 Diptera resemble the Hmenoptera we cannot say that Hymenoptera ever assume the form of any flies and moths They seem isolated and resemble only themselves In tlie case of the Laphria the plump beelike form and tlie dense geria yellow and black hirsuties which cause them to be mistaken for humblebees by persons unacquainted with their structural differences are just those features that are exceptional iu the Diptera and are normal in the Hymenop tera Tlie fly to get tliem has to pass over one suborder to obtain a bizarre form which is a prevalent and common attribute of the Apidae There is a similar parallelism of analogous forms between the Coleoptera Hemiptera Orthoptera and Neuroptera which seem bound together by affinities such as those that unite by themselves the bees moths and flies Thus there are certain Hemiptera Corixa that resemble the coleop terous genus Brachys Forficula is analogous to the Staphj linidffi and Blatta may be said to resemble some Lampyridoe The close affinities between the Orthoptera and Neuroptera hardly admit of these analogous forms though we find them 26 INSECTS AS MIMICS 283 still Here again we see the isolation of the Coleoptcra from the other suborders with which it is connected The suborders below it by an exact parallel with the case above mentioned reach up and connect themselves by these re markable analogies with the Coleoptera which do not in turn assume any of their forms Some Orthoptera are very coleopterouslike and some Hemiptera are very coleopter ouslike The reverse cannot be said So the Diptera and Lepidoptera as they advance in their family forms are con stantly throwing out hints and suggestions of forms that seem very strange to them but become generalized in the group that tops them Thus in the broad irregular net veined neuropterous fore wing which becomes smaller and thicker in the orthopterous Blatta and still more coleopter ous in the hemipterous Corixa we arrive at the perfected elytron with its regular obsolete veins and new protective function Most of the examples above mentioned are familiar to entomologists and others will occur no doubt to illustrate the subject more fully IVIan authors hae agreed that the suborders of insects can be arranged into two series or groups often called Man dibulata and Haustellata though disagreeing as to the rela tive rank of these two divisions and the true places the suborders should occupy within them It is enough for my purpose to assume that there are two such series though believing that the two culminate in the llymenoptera and Coleoptcra respectivel in the succession that I have indi cated above What have we now in common with both and which shall reunite this seeming polarity in the two series of sub orders There is needed a group which while retaining its own strong fundamental features and maintaining an equal footing with its equivalent groups shall have besides the strongest analogies to those groups farthest removed by 27 284 Pacicard affinity in order tliat tliese two series may be virtually brought together while the successive forms in the several families shall afford us some conception of the larger cate gories these minor groups foreshadow Such a group Pro fessor Agassiz has pointed out in the class of Selachians which combine the characters of all the other classes of fishes existing during the same period and also by their being the earliest in time afford what he calls jfojhetic types Fig 220 Fig 221 Lepisma Campodea of all the coming classes of vertebrates The former case affords what he calls synthetic types In endeavoring to show that a similar synthesis as marked as in the fishes or reptiles or other groups of animals occurs in the different nonropterous families of insects the case of the Lejnsma Fig 220 L quadrlseriata or bristle tail may be cited which is closely allied to the Campodea Fig 221 Essay on Classification 28 INSECTS AS MIMICS 285 supposed to be a stem form of all the insects and which is a remarkable synthetic type combining the characters of the sixfooted insects and the Mriopods The two families of May flies and dragon flies do not have any species with marked analogies to other insects In an FlG 222 Adult of the Ant Lion other famly however of which the adult of the ant lion Fig 222 is an example we have the Ascalaphus which was regarded by Scopoli as a Papilio the wings being large and broad and the antennai knobbed The neuropterous Mantispa Fig 223 in its fore legs adapted for seizing its prey mimics the orthopterous Mantis The Panorpa Fig 224 the type of another family of netveined insects assumes the shape of the crane flies Tipula Bittacus has its analogue in the fly named Bittacomorpha The large lacc winged fly called Polystoechotes has some features reminding us of the Hepialus Fig 225 The Cdddis flics imitate the Tineid moths so closely that excellent entomologists have confounded them The species of Psocus mimic the Aphides so closely that they are often 2d Mantispa 286 HALF llOUKS WITH ENSECTS mistaken for each other and the wingless Atropos or death tick reminds us of the louse The ants have among the Neuroptera their well known analogues the Termites or white ants Like the true ants they live in large colonies and have wingless workers of two sorts Now these and certain peculiarities in structure which place the white ants at the head of the Neuroptera are just those which make them so much like the true ants which are among the most highly developed insects ranking near the honey bee From the facts here and elsewhere given it may be re garded as quite well proved that some if not the majority of mimics among insects belong to groups lovver in the or ganic scale than the insects they mimic Moreover the paleontological record shows that the Neuroptera were the Fig 224 Fig 235 Panorpa Hepialus first to appear The fossil forms discovered were also S3n thetic types combining the characters of other neuropterous and some orthopterous families These fossil insects it should be olserved were remarkable mimics but we have no proof that the living insects they resemble were then in existence Wo can only explain the matter by regarding ihem as prophetic tjpes anticipating in nature the coming of whole families and even orders of insects They repre sent ancestral or stem forms from which arose lines of de scent resulting in the present insect creation The original Devonian May flylike insect and the Xenoneura and Ilomo thetus as well as the Carboniferous Miamia and Hemeristia and Eugereon possessed features which they have perhaps transmitted through different sources resulting in families whose distinguishing marks are based on the primordial traits united in tlie same insect but now scattered in differ ent families For example the raptorial fore leg and form of the head of the singular neuropterous insect Miama the peculiar veining of the Avings form characters now existing in two very different families Just as the embryo dog passes through a fish and a reptile stage before attaining its canine physiognomy have the Neuroptera of the jresent day in the process of building up new groups based on a modification of a single character thrown aside the characters united in the more embryonic and primitive t3pes We would thus expect to find among the fossil insects the most startling anticipations of types not yet called into existence The scanty paleontological record we have shows that the grasshoppers and their allies appeared after the Neuroptera that the bugs Hemiptera appeared still later tliat the moths and butterflies were very late in their arrival that the flies probably preceded the Ilymenoptera and that the bees and wasps the most highly developed structurally and intellectually of all insects were the latest to be developed It is a startling fact that the white ants which foreshadow so wonderfully the true ants appear in great force in the coal formation while tiie ants do not occur fossil before the Tertiary period Now as an example of mimicry any one ignorant of the geological record would rcgaid the case of the white ants as one of the best but the fiict is the white ants were nearly as perfect and doubtless as wonderful in their colonizing instincts in the Carboniferous period as in the age of man Clearly then mimicry in the sense of being a factor in the origin of species does not as a rule exist thougli there may be exceptions and it is not improbable that a large iroportion of socalled mimics are so by virtue of their similar physical surroundings There have been cycles of creation as if the  same thought were taken up in successive geological periods and worked out in different ways but with the same funda mental plan The plan is the result of an unbroken line of forms transmitted by genetic descent the variations in the typical forms have been induced by changes in the soil and air These lines of development from socalled archetypal forms suddenly stop and we have to follow them back before we can again take up the thread of development of other lines There is not a continuous chain of being but lines of development sometimes parallel but more often diverging and connected by cross ties and branches linking the animal creation into a whole all converging to a primordial ances tor perhaps no more highly organized than the structureless Moner a drop of living moving selfreproducing proto plasm Turning now to the cases of mimicry in the butterflies described by Messrs Bates and Wallace and Trimen from South America the East Indies and South Africa respec tively all agree that the Heliconidae are mimicked by other butterflies which are ver unlike the members of their own families and cop in form and color the HeliconidiB which probably owing to a bad odor are not eaten by birds and thus multiply in great abundance The object of the mimic is claimed to be a utilitarian one It flies about in the dis guise of a Heliconia and were it not for this protection it and its offspring would become extinct This resemblance moreover has probably these authors claim been brought about by natural and sexual selection In the beginning some butterfly through the tendency to variation assumed by Mr Darwin had a remote resemblance to a Heliconia this favored it above its fellows and the character growing more strongly marked became perpetuated until after a great number of generations the similarity of form became perfected Mr Darwin adopts the view and regards the mimicry as brought about by natural and sexual selection 32 INSECTS AS MIMICS 2 Bates sajs that a large number of the species of Ileli couklae are accompanied in the districts they inhabit by otner species whicli counterfeit them in the way described The imitators belong to the following groups Papilio Pieris Euterpe and Leptalis family Papilionidse Proto gonius Nymphalidie Ithomeis Erycinidne Castnia Cast niadae Dioptis Pericopis Iljclosia and other genera Bom bycidae moths I conclude that the Heliconidie are the objects imitated because they all have the same family facies whilst the analogous species are dissimilar to their nearest allies perverted as it were to produce the resemblance from the normal facies of the genus or family to which they severally belong The resemblance is so close that it is only after long practice that the true can be distinguished from the counterfeit when on the wing in their native for ests I was never able to distinguish the Leptalides from the species they imitated although they belong to a family totally different in structure and metamorphosis from the Heliconidne without examining them closely after capture They fly in the same parts of the forests and generally in company with the species they mimic In the United States we have a similar example the only one known in this country The Danmis Disijnis is one of our most common butterflies It is closely copied by the Limenitis Archippxis Fig 226 from Tenneys Zoology which is unlike in color every otlier known species of its genus The Archippus enjojs immunity frfm the attacks of birds on account of its pungent odor which is supposed to be disagreeable to them hence it is vorj abundant Tiie Disippus butterfly on the other hand which is inodorous is supposed to be mistaken by tlic birds for the Archippus and thus multiplies in as great numbers as the pattern it copies Such are the opinions of these distinguished writers It will be noticed that tlie Ileliconidre are regarded by Mr Bates and in this respect Mr Trimen agrees with turn 19 1 gyu as standing at the head of the group of butterflies the Papi lio usually being assigned to this position Here then the mimickers are possibly lower in rank than the butterflies they mimic This is certainly the case with the Castnia and the moths mentioned by Mr Bates and bears out our idea that the mimickers may have been produced in an age ante rior to the origin of the Heliconidic and that the causes which produced the one perhaps originated the other The Fig 22G Limeiiitis Archippus mimickers created in a former geological period may have been preserved by virtue of their resemblance to butterflies originating at a later date Many of the Bombycid moths are remarkable mimics of other moths and this group with tlie wide gaps in it may be compared to the Neuroptera witli their isolated genera and families I regard the Bombycids as an ancient family in which time has made many inroads and the relics which have come down to us may have owed their preservation largely to the protective mimicry of tlie caterpillars anil co coons to leaves and other objects and of the moths to other moths Assuming then that protective mimicry has been an im puriant lactor in the preservation of species we will exam 2 INSECTS AS MIMICS 291 ine a number of cases some of which are not recorded so far as the writer is aware but which any one can see for Iiimself in his rambles out of doors The humble bees are mimicked bj the Apathus which takes up its abode in their nests The peculiar relations existing between the Apathus and its host are not well understood The Apathus is closely related to the humble bee only differing fiom it in the structure of the jaws and hind legs disabling it from gathering honey and pollen and caring for its young Another well known mimic of humble bees is the Volucella a large plump hirsute fly in form and color closely copying the bee Protected by this resem blance they enter the nests of their hosts and their young devour the young bees Bees fiq 227 are also mimicked by certain Syrphus flies see Fig 107 and by Laphria flies The wasps are imitated often very closely by certain Srphus flies Fig 26 a The most extra ordinary case of this kind is a Syrphus fly called Spilomyia I Vespa maciilata I once noticed this fly resting on a leaf in northern Maine and involuntarily drew back supposing it to be a white faced wasp Vespa maculata Fig 227 It is smoothbodied with the abdomen nearly cylin drical and thoroughly wasplike The position and form of the markings are almost exactly as in the wasp the face is white and the eyes are banded with white in imitation of the white orbits of the Avasps Even the abdomen or hind body is banded only towards the tip as in the wasp while the legs are slashed with white much as in the wasp An otlier Syrphus Epopter vittatxs with a cylindrical body is banded with bright yellow and resembles the Vesjya vulgaris while there are other species such as Doros hahjras which 3 292 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS resemble the Odynerus wasp Other forms recall the mason bees Osmia and two green species Srrjjhus ohscurus and Sargus obscurus recall Ceratina the little green bee which tunnels the blackberry and syringa The Euglossa a bee with a remarkably long tongue is mimicked by Pangonia equally favored with a long beak Wasps are also mimicked by lower Hymenoptera as the large Chalcis fly Leucospis Fig 228 which is so unlike others of its family The Trypoxylon wasp with its clubshaped body is copied by the Conops even to the peculiar hue of the front edge of the wings Descending the scale of hymenopterous life we come to the Pompilus Fig 61 which is mimicked by the large black Mydas fly whose antennae are unusuall loig and hymenopterouslike Certain ants are mimicked by species Fig 23 Clerus beetles which are colored in the same manner and run rapidly on the branches of bushes very much like ants A certain beetle is called Formicomus from its resemblance to Formica the ant Among butterflies the Papilio or swal lowtailed butterfly is very closely mim Leucospis 1 1 1 n icked both in form and color by the highly colored swallowtailed geometrid moth Urania and there is another geometrid moth that recalls the tailed The cla The Thyris moth is copied by the Desmia a little black P3ralid moth with large white spots on the wings On the otlier hand there are some moths which resemble so closely those of families below them that to this day in some cases entomologists have been mistaken in regard to them The Doryodes with its feathered antennoe is in reality an owlet Noctuid moth but has until recently been re gaxded as a geometrid moth allied to Aspilates So with Boletobia and Pachycnemia which are also Noctuid moths with analogies to the geometrid moths Among the Bomby cid moths are such forms as Euphanessa and Crocota which 4 IXSECTS AS MIMICS 293 remind us of geometiid moths and they fly by day associated with them The wingless flics nearl always show a tendency to re semble spiders from the wingless gnatlike Chionca Fig 229 a down to the sheep tick the bat tick Fig 229 c and the bee louse Fig 229 h I do not regard these however as cases of protective mimicry but interesting Fig 229 Chionea Bat tick Bee louse analogies resulting from the loss of wings and other dcgra dational characters induced by their usually parasitic mode of life A singular case of mimicry may be olserved in the moth Lycomorpha so named ly Dr Harris from its resemblance when at rest to Lycus which possesses broad wingcovers elytra The fore wings of the moth are shaped like the elytra of the beetle the veins being mucli raised like the ridges on the beetles wings while the arrangement of the colors is almost identical and the antenna of the moth are broad and flattened like those of the beetle The burrows of the mole cricket arc in North Carolina as I have been informed by Mr Slnite tenanted by a large bug which has fore feet somewhat like those of the mole 5 294 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS Packakd cricket Here the change in form has been evidently in duced by its fossorial life and we should not perhaps regard this as a case of protective mimicry There are other bugs of large size with the legs provided with flattened expan sions like some longhorned beetles 6 INSECTS AS ARCHITE A N historical sketcli of human architecture would scarcely begin Avith a description of the capitol at Washington or of Westminster Abbey or the still incomplete catliedral of Cologne but would rather extend back to the earliest forms of human shelter even to the pile dwellings of prehistoric Switzerland nor would the historian disregard the rock shelters of Europe and this country or tlie caves of Dordogne In his accounts of the rise of the art of building he would be obliged to treat the subject after the method of tlie paleontologist and recon struct the primitive dwellings of the men of the reindeer period from the scanty relics of their age with the aid of the huts and wigwams of savage tribes now living Work ing out these problems he would then reconstruct in the imagination the vast structure of Stonehenge the palaces of the Aztecs and would then be prepared to deal with the rise of architecture in Egypt India and Greece So we may study the subject of insect architecture in the light of paleontology and finding in the rocks the remains of lost tribes judge what manner of builders they might have been by the work of their survivors of the present day vhose forms for aught we know are little superior to those of their ancestors of Devonian times just as the sav age of today is perhas scarcely a step in advance of the wearer of the skull of Tuolumne valle or the cave of Neanderthal Without much doubt the first cavedweller was some Po duran Fig 230 or a Campodealike being if such lived in Presilurian times They were tlie troglodytes of that misty period living in holes in the earth which wound their devi 7 296 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS PAcnAKT ous way under stones There have been found in rocks of the coal period spiderlike forms supposed to be allied to our modern harvest men or the cave dweller of Vfyandotte Cave Fig 231 after Cope whose outofdoor relatives are said b Simon a French entomologist to burrow several feet deep in the porous soil of southern Europe Associated with these fossils are found the remains of undoubted spi ders and in all likelihood they spun silken nests and thus Fig 230 Fig 231 Podura Erebomaster anticipated eons ago the light graceful iron work of our suspension bridges crystal palaces and mammoth railroad stations But as early as the Devonian period the time which ushered in the Coal epoch when the ferns and land plants made their appearance and the huge ganoids and sharks disported in the seas at this early date insects resembling the May fly but much larger fluttered over the low shores and sluggish streams of our continent Since they must have had the same organization as the modern Ephemera see Figs 117 118 it is reasonable to suppose that they had the same habits The first architects then so far as fossil evidence goes in their larval stage lived in burrows con 8 INSECTS AS ARCHITECTS 297 structed in the mud or in rude tunnels beneath stones at the bottom of streams and ponds or they supported their arched ways on the stalks of aquatic plants These builders of Devonian times in a way unconscious to themselves tried the strength of their rude building material practised the art of the mason and applied the principles of the geome trician in their rough and ready mechanics In the Coal formation we find wings of fossil insects closely resembling our white ants and belonging perhaps in the same family Now some species of tliese insects are among the most skilled architects in the insect world We shall see farther on how remarkable their large roomy dwell ings are Otiiers construct tunnels in deca3ed trees Our common white ant Termes Jlavipes is known either to mine the roots of grape vines the trunks of elms pine stumps or to run secret galleries in the sills of houses or to live under flat stones with nests apparently like those of ants found in the same situations Different species so far as we know have quite different habits For example the nests of Termes arborum are described by Smeathman as surrounding the branch of a tree at the height of seventy or eiglity feet and though but rarely of so large a size as big as a very great sugar cask They are composed of small particles of wood and the various gums and juices of trees combined witli ierhaps those of the animals and worked by these little industrious creatures into a paste and so moulded into innumerable little cells of very different and irregular forms These nests are very compact and so strongly attached to the boughs on which they arc fixed that there is no detaching them but by cutting them in pieces or sawing off the branch The nest communicates with the ground by covered wa3S leading to the roots of the trees Again he describes some nests that resemble the complex nests of Tennes heUicosus but are smaller and of simpler construction They are built in sandy plains and 9 298 are composed of a black mud which is brought from a few inches below the white sand and are built in the form of an imperfect cone or bellshaped having their tops rounded These nests are generally about four or five feet high Smeathman Other nests are built in the form of a mush room The most elaborate architectural works perhaps under taken by any insects are the nests of the Termes bellicosus observed by Smeathman Our figure from Figuier after Smeathman will give an idea of the nest and its interior with the Termes family grouped in the foreground Smeath man a traveller in Guinea who published his account of these insects in 1781 claims and we think with reason that the Termites resemble the ants also in their provident and diligent labor but surpass them as well as the bees wasps beavers and all other animals which I have ever heard of in the arts of building as much as the Europeans excel the least cultivated among the savages It is more than prob able they excel them as much in sagacity and the arts of government it is certain they show more substantial in stances of their ingenuity and industry than au other ani mals and do in fact lay up vast magazines of provisions and other stores a degree of prudence which has of late years been denied perhaps without reason to the ants The nests or termitary of this white ant are more or less conical or sugarloafshaped rising from ten to twelve feet above the surface of the ground Indeed they are said to be still higher by Jobson in his History of Gambia quoted by Smeathman as follows The Ant hills are re markable cast up in those parts by Pismires some of them twenty foot in height of corapasse to contayne a dozen men with the heat of the sun baked into that hardnesse that we used to hide ourselves in the ragged tops of them when we took up stands to shoot at deere or wild beasts Purchass Pilgrims vol ii p 1570 Smeathman tells us 10 Packakp insects as ARCHITECTS 299 that on those he saw four men eoukl stand with ease The nests are ornamented with numerous conical turrets some times four or five feet high Tlie walls of this dome are exceedingly hard and form a sort of shell protecting an inte rior building divided into an amazing number of apart ments for the king and queen and the nursing of their numerous progeny or for magazines which are always found well filled with stores and provisions These colos sal hills begin as little turrets a foot high others are built near them the highest one being built in the middle until the spaces between are filled up and the whole built together into a single dome This outer shell or dome not only pro tects and shelters the rooms within but maintains an equi table temperature and moisture within very necessary for hatching the eggs and cherishing the young ones In the centre of the inner building near the base is the ovenlike royal chamber which is enlarged from an inch to six or eight inches or more in the clear as the queen in creases in size Here the king and queen are kept willing prisoners as the entrances are only large enough to admit the workers which are much smaller The ro3al chamber is surrounded by multitudes of smaller apartments which con nect with the larger magazines and nurseries The maga zines are filled with provisions consisting of the gum of trees in small tears resembling the sugar about preserved fruits The nurseries containing the eggs and young are built of wooden materials seemingly joined together with gums and situated around the royal chamber All these apartments lead by arched passages into an open area or rotunda under the dome which is compared by Sineathman to the nave of a cathedral This nave is surrounded bf three or four very large Gothicshaped arches which are sometimes two or three feet high next the front of the area but diminish very rapidly as they recede from thence like the arches of aisles in perspectives and are soon 11 ¦SOO »¦ ¦ lost atepnthe innumerable chambers and nurseries behind tliera This nave is covered with a roof sufficient to keep the room dry during the heavy rains This roof is not ex actly flat because the Avorkers are always adding to it by building more chambers and nurseries so that the divisions or columns between the future arched apartments resemble the pinnacles upon the fronts of some old buildings and demand particular notice as affording one proof that for the most part the insects project their arches and do not make them as 1 imagined for a long time by excavation The floor of the nave is very tliick and forms the roof of the royal chamber though containing several nurseries and magazines It is likewise water proof and contrived as far as I could guess to let the water off if it should get in and run over by some short way into the subterraneous pas sages which run under the lowest apartments in the hill in various directions and

galleries are lined very thick with the same kind of clay of which the hill is com posed and ascend the inside of the outward shell in a spiral manner and winding round the whole building up to the top intersect each other at different heights opening either immediately into the dome in various places and into tlie interior building the new turrets etc or communicating thereto by other galleries of different bores or diameters either circular or oval From these large galleries smaller ones extend to various parts of the building and a great many run three or four feet under ground where the Ter mites obtain the fine soil with which they build their nests Other galleries adds Smeathman ascend and lead out horizontally on every side and are carried under ground near to the surface a vast distance for if 3ou destroy all 12 INSECTS AS ARCHITECTS 301 the nests within one hundred 3ards of your house the in habitants of those which are left unmolested farther off will nevertheless carry on their subterraneous galleries and in vade the goods and merchandizes contained in it by sap and mine and do great mischief if you are not very circum spect Smeathman then remarks that the galleries are neiessarily large as they are the great thoroughfares for all the laborers and soldiers going forth or returning upon any business whatever whether fetching clay wootl water or provisions and they are certainly well calculated for the purposes to which they are applied by the spiral sloie which is given them for if they were perpendicular the laborers would not be able to carry on their building with so much facility as the ascend a perpendicular with great difficulty and the soldiers can scarce do it at all It is on this account that sometimes a road like a ledge is made on the perpen dicular side of any part of the building within their hill which is flat on the upper surface and half an inch wide and ascends gradually like a staircase or like those roads which are cut on the sides of hills and mountains that would otherwise be inaccessible by which and similar contri vances they travel with great facility to every interior part This too is probabl the cause of their building a kind of bridge of one vast arch which answers the purpose of a flight of stairs from the floor of the area to some opening on the side of one of the columns which support the great arches which must shorten the distance exceedingly to those labourers who have the eggs to carry from tlie royal chamber to some of the upier nurseries wliich in some hills would be four or five feet in the straightest line and much more if carried through all the winding passages which lead through the inner chambers and apartments Whether the work of these white ants is due to the opera tions of a blind instinct or unconscious automatism may well be doubted It should be borne in mind also that the 13 302 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS insects belong to the lowest division of the winged insects and even geologically speaking to a very ancient stock It is significant to find developed in them such a high degree of architectural skill The mechanical ingenuity of the case worms is shown in the construction of their cases Tliese are ancient types of insect forms thought to be in some respects similar to those occurring in the coal formation while undoubted caddis flies occurred in the Wealden strata of the Lower Creta ceous formation Sir Charles Lyell assures us that a large species of caddisworm which swarmed in the Eocene lakes of Auvergne in France was accustomed to attach to its dwelling the shells of a small spiral univalve of the genus Paludina It must have resembled the cases of the British Limnophilus Jlavicornis whose case Fig 232 is covered Fig 3 with little fresh Avater snail shells Other examples of the work of these interesting insects are given on page 132 They gather bits of leaves or sticks or particles of gravel Avith their jaws and arransje Case worm » j i o them around tlieir bod covering their hind body first and then building on to the anterior end gluing the particles together by means of a silky secretion They probably do not use their fore legs in this process at least the clothes moth does not in constructing a similar case Other cases are made by rolling up a strip of leaf deftly cut out of the required length and width as seen in Fig 92 while others more careless attach broad irregular pieces to their cases Another netveined insect which shows much ingenuity in the construction of its dwelling and mucli low cunning in providing itself with food is the ant lion This is the larva of the Myrmeleo Its body is broad and flat armed with enormous scissorlike jaws which project straiglit out from the head It lives in colonies sometimes numbering over 14 INSECTS AS ARCHITECTS 303 six liiinclrecl individuals eacli Ijing at the bottom of its hole Mr Emerton has described in the American Naturalist iv p 70 the habits of our Mijnneleo immaculatiis Fig 233 with the larva seen from beneath and the pupa It digs a pit in the sand an inch deep and two inches iu diam eter Mr Emerton thinks the ant lion begins its hole by making a circle and afterwards throwing out the sand from the centre In digging he used his flat head and jaws which were pushed under several grains of sand and then jerked upwards throwing their load sometimes as far as six inches and alwa3s far enough to avoid leaiug a ridge around the pitfall When the pit was finished he was en tirely concealed beneath it as in Fig 233 except his jaws Fig 233 Ant Lioii and its pit which were spread apart horizontally at the bottom The surface of the pit being as steep as the sand could be piled up was very easily disturbed and when an insect ventured over the edge the antlion was apprised of it at once by the falling sand lie immediately began to throw up sand from the bottom deepening tlie pit and so causing the sand to slip down from the sides and the insect with it The ant lion seized it with his long jaws and held it above his head until he had sucked all he wanted from it when he threw the remainder out of the hole and repaired the trap After eating he became more timid and sometimes would not take a second insect If however several were 15 304 put into the pit at once lie would bite one after the other until all were killed before deciding on which to begin While the grasshoppers do not construct nests they have various methods of securely depositing their eggs either in the earth or in rotten wood or on the surface of leaves Tiie wingless grasshoppers avail themselves of rocks as shelters a notable example being the wingless grasshopper of Mam moth and other caves in Kentucky Fig 234 The English cricket is said by White in his Natural History of Selborn to form burrows in the earth but this habit has not yet been discovered in our American species The mole cricket however is known to burrow in damp places in this country Fig 234 Cave Grasshopper as well as Europe where it forms an ovenlike chamber in which it deposits about a hundred eggs It also constructs extensive galleries similar to but smaller than those of tlie mole The tunnel runs just under the surface of the soil and may be detected by the slightl raised ridge of soil like that made by the mole Among the bugs Hemiptera the only species we can now recall as constructing a domicile is the young of tlie seventeenyear Cicada Our figure 235 after Rile repre sents the conical nests raised above the surface of the soil in wet and damp places rising from four to six inches above 16 Packaud INSECTS AS ARCHITECTS 305 the ground with a hole e at the base Mr Rathvon who observed this fact says that the pupae await in the upper end of these chambers

would attach themselves to the first object at hand and undergo their transformations in the usual manner Many plant lice allied to the Aphis by their punctures cause the adjacent parts of the leaf to curl over and conceal Fig Younpr 17vcar Cioaila and its nest them or even give rise to the true galls as elaborate as those of the gull lly A kind of Peniijhigus forms on the sumac the irregular growth represented by figure 23G after Riley The cockscomb elm gall Fig 237 after Riley often occurs in great numbers on the leaves of the white elm By the end of June or the beginning says JMr Walsh the gall becomes full of winged plantlice when the slit on the upper side of the leaf through which the mother plant louse built up the gall early in tlie spring gapes open and 20 17 306 HALF HOURS WITH IXSECTS allows the insects to escape into the open air These galls can scarcely be regarded as evidences of architectural skill as they are indirectly due to the simple punctures of the beak of the insect not to an intellectual act Among the beetles we shall not find evidence of any con siderable skill in building Tlie habit of the Chlamys of building a compact little case has already been referred to Its case is black and appears to be formed of little pellets of excrement with a seam along the middle of the under Fig 236 Sumac grail side which readily spreads open when the sac is pressed The case is slightly contracted at the entrance where the pellets are a little larger than elsewhere The weevils are the lowest of the beetles and yet they display in some cases great ingenuity in providing appropri ate places in which to lay their eggs I have often watched the doings of the Attelahus rhois Fig 238 represents an other species A analis while rolling up the leaves of the alder Late in June and during the early part of July in 18 INSECTS AS ARCHITECTS 307 Maine I observed the female while engaged in making one of these singular thimblelike rolls NVhen about to deposit an egg she picks up a leaf with her mandibles and begins to cut with her jaws a slit near the base of the leaf on each side of the midrib and at light angles to it so that the leaf may be folded together Before beginning to roll up the leaf she gnaws the stem nearly off so that after the roll is made and has dried for perhaps a day it is easily de tached by the wind and falls to the ground Then folding the leaf she tightly rolls it up with her jaws and legs neatly tucking ill the ends until a compact cylindrical solid mass Fig 217 Fig Cockscomb gall Attelabns is formed Before the roll is completed she deposits a single egg rarel two in the middle next to the midrib where it lies loose in a little cavity While she is thus engaged her partner a little smaller may often be seen watching her from the otlier end of the leaf but never lending his aid as in the case of the timber beetles The roll serves as a mass of food for the young grub to feed upon and may be ie garded as an artificial bud The larvfE of the Tiger beetles have the requisite instinct to make deep tubular pits in which they lie in wait for their 19 308 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS prey The construction of their nests does not require so much intelligence as is shown by the ant lion The larva is a hideous being with a large horn on its back by which it is enabled to prop itself up in its hole None of the flies are architects Some involuntarily form galls of various shapes in which the maggots are domiciled For example the gallfly of the willow forms the familiar pineconelike swelling Fig 239 found on willow twigs while another kind forms a mass of willow leaves like the Fig 239 Willinv gall Cabbnge willow gall sprouts on a cabbage Fig 240 The manychambered gall of the gallgnat of the grape vine is represented by figure 241 this and the two preceding figures from Riley and Mr Riley has delineated the filbert gall which grows in large masses on the grape vine Fig 242 representing a mass of them of the natural size Among the caterpillars of the moths are many of the smaller kinds which mine the leaves of plants or tunnel the stems others more skilful cut out portions of leaves and 20 INSECTS AS ARCHITECTS 309 convert them into sacks which they bear about with them much as in tlie caddis worms The 3oung clothes moth Fig 243 a its sack 6 chrysalis bites off pieces of the woollen cloth on which it feeds sticks them together by means of a silky secretion and thus forms a close dense sac As it grows instead of throwing away the sac it has outgrown it makes a slit on each side fills in the rent with new material and adds more to the mouth thus enlarging and refitting its house Certain small caterpillars of the Acrobasis and other allied genera economize their excrement constructing between the Fig 241 Mauychambered Grape Gall leaves of the birches on which they feed little trumpet shaped cases out of the little black pellets Tlie case of the basket worm is a curious object Fig 244 a moth wingless female c larva rf case repre sents the different stages of growth of a small species found in Florida by Mr T Glover Our common basket worm is a familiar object in the middle and southern states Its case is about two inches in length and while the interior is lined densely with silk on the outside are stuck pieces of cedar twigs and leaves sometimes half an inch in length We have seen the young just after leaving the egg beginning to build their cases which are at first broad and shallow like a basket and it is a comical sight to see the little tiny worms creeping rapidly along their tails held straight ui in 21 310 HALP HOURS WITH INSECTS the air capped by this basket reminding one of a small boy walking along with a large bushel basket over his head Then there are the tent caterpillars which spin from their mouths an immense quantity of silk out of which they build large tents between the branches of trees and run rope walks along the upper side of all the branches leading away Fig 242 Filbert Grape Gall from their tent The nest of a species of Tortrix which lives on the wild cherry consists of a large mass of leaves sewed together with silk forming a shelter from the heat and rain and a protection from the birds There are numberless modifications of leafrolling habits among the smaller caterpillars but after all no insects with 22 IJNSECTS AS ARCHITECTS 311 the exception of the Termites present such evidences of mechanical skill as the bees and wasps and ants The Hymenoptera of which they are the most familiar examples were among the latest insects to appear on the surface of the earth The lower forms so far as the scanty records show appeared first in the Jurassic rocks while the ants are first found in the amber of the Tertiary period so that the ants and wasps and bees were in all probability among the latest insect creations This inference is borne out by the fact that the individuals and species are ver abundant Did they belong to an ancient stock their numbers would have been thinned out The lowest hymenopterous insect which lives in a house of its own not however made with its own hands is a kind Fig 243 Clothes Mth

swelling or tumor is formed in which the falsecaterpillar lives and feeds on the walls of its house which grows with its growth Mr Walsh has studied these gall sawflies The gall in which Euura orbitalis lives is at first a bud vhich is enlarged two or three times its natural size l»cfore it unfolds in spring In the autumn it bores through the walls of its dwelling and descends to the ground burrowing an inch deep below the surface Here it 23 312 HALF HOURS WITH IXSECTS Packakd spins a thin silken whitish cocoon Other species take up their abode in galls made by twowinged gall gnats and are hence called guest or inquiline sawflies These galls are sometimes inhabited also by a caterpillar so that we have a sawfly caterpillar a true caterpillar and a maggot making use of the same kind of gall They do not however crowd into the same domicile at once In this case at any rate nature does not set the laws of hygiene at defiance and crowd two or three fiimilies in a single room The necessi ties of modern civilization or an outgrowth from it in our cities crowd several families in a single room Is not a human life of as much accouut as a caterpillars The sawflies with their exceptional gallmaking habits anticipate in nature the true gall flies those singular beings Fig 244 whom a gall is their world and the gall of bitterness a perennial foun tain of nectar To these little white maggots the young gall flies the poor scribbler who is obliged like Douglas Jerrold to feed his family out of an inkstand owes his all Quite uncon Basket Worm scious of the responsibility resting upon him our maggot truly an unconscious automaton by its simple presence in the leaf or stem and with no more intention to be an agent in bringing about a desired result than though it were a grain of sand lies passively in its cell while the growthforce of the plant erects a house over and around this foreign body No more intellectual act is needed on the part of the guest than in its unconscious host the plant The case of the gall maggot is an excellent example of unconscious automatism while I imagine the reader will agree with me that the case of the white ant or the true ants as well as many bees and Avasps is of an entirely dif ferent order and oarries us into a sphere where tlie sensibili ties the will and the intellect exert at least some force 24 PACKAun INSECTS AS ARCHITECTS 313 The largest gall we have is made b the Cijnips confluens found on the scrub oak It sometimes attains a diameter of two inches It begins to form as soon as the leaves unfold It is at first gicen and pulpy and has a central kernel in wliicli the maggot resides When tlie gall is ripe the shell becomes hard and dr and after the fly has es caped which occurs in June and again in October the de serted shell is often tenanted by wasps Some galls as the bedeguar of the rose are covered with vegetable hairs and the variety of form in others is very great On the rasp berry and blackborr as well as the blueberry occur differ ent sorts of galls All are the result of the sting of the female which is thought by some to convc a poison into the wound though it is a question whether the egg introduced by the sting or ovipositor docs not act as an irritant body causing an excessive flow of sap and accumulation of cells resulting in the formation of a tumor Passing by the ichneumon flies which after all have the best of it as they are tenants of living homes supplied with the choicest of food at no trouble and expense to themselves we come to the cuckoo flies The Chrysis Fig 245 is not a true wasp but is in some re spects allied to it Its integument is very hard and tliick and beautifully tinted with green and blue and vari ous metallic colors When assailed it rolls itself into a ball in the manner of a pill bug Its sting is large and exceedingly painful but not ioisonUs Tle Chrysis is called a cuckoo fly as it has the ichneumon trait of living at the expense of other insects This fly may often be seen flying about posts and hollow stalks of plants exploring the holes of wasps and bees wlure they lay their eggs The young hatch out some time after the larval bee or wasp anil then attack the latter sucking its 25 314 blood The patience and perseverance under great natural difficulties the danger to which they are exposed from the attacks of their unwilling hosts would form an interesting chapter but we must come now to the true builders The ants are their own architects their own masons and laborers I shall not now speak of their colonies and com plex mode of life It is well known that the workers carry on the labors of the colony and to these beings which have not the power of transmitting their qualities but inherit them from their parents has been imparted a high degree of skill in fact somewhat of those qualities which charac terize the highest types of human civilization for Avhile ants are fully capable of defending themselves and as every Fig 246 body knows are bold and aggressive to a fault the also excel in the arts of peace As bridgemakers they have anticipated our civil engineers The driver ants Anomma Fig 24G which are blind are said by Dr G A Perkins who has observed them in Western Africa to often bridge narrow streams of water when these come across their path by going in large numbers upon a flexible plant on one side of a stream until river n jj jjgit causes it to bend to the other side This ant is certainly equal in this respect at least to the monkeys which are said to cross streams in a similar manner But it is in the construction of underground tunnels that ants aie preeminent The late Gideon Lincecum so well known for his acute powers of observation in an account of the CEcodoma Texana states tliat they often carry their subterranean roads for several hundred yards in grassy dis tricts where the grass would prove an impediment to their progress On one occasion to secure access to a gentle mans garden where they were cutting the vegetables to pieces they tunnelled beneath a creek which was at that place fifteen or twenty feet desp and from bank to bank 26 INSECTS AS ARCHITECTS 315 about thirty fe5t Another species in Brazil according to Rev Hamlet Clark will tunnel a ditch and he adds Indeed I have been assured again and again by sensible men that it has undermined in its progress through the country the great river Paraiba as broad as the Thames at London Bridge at any rate without anything like a natural or arti ficial bridge it appears on the other side and continues its course It would be exceedingly interesting to watch the succes sive steps of this tunnelling process to learn how they plan their work how the mine is run under the stream with such true engineering skill from one side to the other how the danger of undermining and flooding are overcome Here we have a slight anticipation of the Thames tunnel though this is said to have been suggested by the tunnel of the ship worm which lines its hole with limestone Ants also dig wells The same Texan CEcodoma we are told by Dr Lincecum needs water as much as cattle or men and like the latter tiey dig their own wells In one case where a man dug a well reaching water at a depth of thirty feet the ants dug a well to the same depth with a diameter of twelve inches As mound builders the ants are indefatigable With the aid of their jaws they carry out grain after grain of sand and from being primarily tunnellers they become mound builders An ant hill common object as it is is a marvel of patient and untiring labor Think of the toil and mus cular exertion spent by these ants in climbing from the depths below up the perpendicular walls of their nests with their burdens and busy as they appear to us by day they are said to do the greater part of their work by night In clayey countries in Mexico the Oicodomas build enormous ant hills so that one perceives them from afar by the pro jection which they form above the level of the soil as well as by the absence of vegetation in their immediate neighbor 27 316 hood These nests occupy a surface of many square metres and their depth varies from one to two metres Sumichrast The exact height of these ant hills is not stated The largest earthen nests of which we have any account are those described by the Jesuit Dobrizhoffer and alluded to by West wood in his Introduction to the Modern Classification of Insects The conical nests of these ants which abound in the plains of Paraguay are said to be as hard as stone and three or four ells high A Flemish English and French ell are three five and six quarters of a yard respectively which measurement is intended by the Portuguese writer or Prof Westwood is not stated By English measurement the hills would be about twelve feet high This is the only case where the hills of the ants emulate in size those of the Termites Our largest native nests are made by the For mica sangicijiea or common large red ant and consist of sand or claj according to the nature of the ground Un doubtedly the object of the ants in making the hills is to keep the water out of their burrows but in Labrador where it rains nearly every other day I have observed that this or an allied species makes no hillocks but lives exclusively in underground passages Another kind of ant attains a still higher degree of civili zation The Agricultural ant of Texas studied for so many years by Dr Liucecura is said by him in the American Naturalist to build paved cities and construct roads In a year and a half from the time the colony begins the ants previously living concealed beneath the surface appear above and clear away the grass herbage and other litter to the distance of three or four feet around the entrance to their city and construct a pavement consisting of a pretty hard crust about half an inch thick formed of coarse sand and grit These pavements would be inundated in the rainy season hence at least six months previous to the coming of the rain they begin to build mounds rising a 317 foot or more from the centre of the pavement Within these mounds are neatly constructed cells into which the eggs young ones and their stores of grain are carried in time of rainy seasons In another place he adds that some old settlements have a pavement fifteen feet in diameter and a mound in the centre a foot high The roads extend for half a mile from the formicar or ant hill One kind of Mexican ant Pseudomyrma flavidula is known to live within the spines of the Mimosa the hole for the entrance and exit of the ants fig 217 being made near the end Fig 247 a In India a greenish ant CEco phylla smaragdina is said by Jer don to form a nest sometimes a foot in diameter by drawing living leaves together without detaching them from the branch and uniting thcin with a fine white web An other Indian ant like the paper wasp makes a small nest about Ant nest in thorns half an inch or rather more in diameter of some papyra ceous material which it fixes on a leaf Jcrdon The ants belonging to the genus Crematogaster and which from their resemblance to a wig are known bj the popular name of Negrohead in Brazil according to IMr F Smith construct their nests on the branches of trees suspending them in the same way as wasps to the nests of which they have a close resemblance on removing the outer covering however they exhibit a very different construction being composed of multitudinous curved intricate ramifications all leading to the interior chambers and galleries There are many sand wasps which excavate holes in the ground and deposit at the bottom of their burrow living but paralyzed insects among which they lay their eggs A 29 318 typical example is the Spliex Fig 59 whose habits have already been doscribecl The mud dauber PelopcBus Jlavi pes is a slender form brightly banded and spotted with yellow and is found all over the country Her cells of pel lets of mud plastered on the wall of a house are common objects known to every school boy These cells are built of la3ers of mud of unequal length the pellets being placed in two rows diverging from the middle Tliey are a little over an inch in lengtli and about half as wide and arc seen in section to be triangular in outline Tiie larva within spins a brown silken cocoon after eating up the store of paralyzed spiders whose remains may often be found tucked away at one end of the cell Several cells usually occur together covered over with a common layer of mud Tliis habit of collecting materials for their nests is shown more distinctly in the black Sphex S tibialis which forms its nest in the tunnels previously made by the carpenter bee in a piece of pine board In an example described in my Guide to the Study of Insects the hole was six inches long and the oval cylindrical cocoons were packed loosely either side by side where there was room or in a single row The interstices between them were filled with bits of rope which appeared as if they had been bitten in pieces b the wasp itself while the end of the cell was filled for a dis tance of two inches with a coarse sedge arranged in layers as if rammed in like gun wadding Another exception to the burrowing habits of the sand wasps is afforded by a Brazilian species of Larrada which according to Mr Bates builds a nest composed apparently of the scrapings of the wooll texture of plants it is at tached to a leaf having a close resemblance to a piece of German tinder or a piece of sponge In thus availing itself of the scrapings of the bark of plants we have a slight anticipation of the papermaking wasps The wood wasps evince fully as much if not more architectuial skill 30 Packaud insects as ARCHITECTS 319 than the sand wasps The different species of Crabro with their hxrge cubical heads tlie Philanthus Fig 248 and Cerceris refit old nail holes and tunnel rotten wood filling their holes Avitli aphides caterpillars beetles and spiders etc The European Philanthus apivorus has the unfortunate habit of provisioning its nest with hone bees so j 243 also with a species of Cerceris The smaller blackish species have the most interesting habits In Europe according to Prof West wood the prey of a species of Oxybelus con sists of flies which it has a peculiar mode Philanthus of carr3ing by the hind legs the while it either opens the aperture of its burrow or else forms a new one with its anterior pair A Tr3pox3lon wasp was detected in England frequenting the holes of a post preoccupied by a species of Od3nerus a solitary wasp closely allied to the social paper wasps into which it conveyed a small round ball or pellet con taining about fifty individuals of a species of Aphis this the Odyncrus upon her return invariably turned out flying out with it held ly her legs to the distance of about a foot from the aperture of her cell where she hovered for a moment and then let it fall and this was constantly the case till the Trypoxylon had sufficient time to mortar up the orifice of the hole and the Odyncrus was then entirely excluded for although she would return to the spot repeatedly she never endeavored to force the entrance but flew off to seek another hole elscwiierc The stems of the syringa elder black berry and other pithy shrubs are also favorite nesting places of these wood wasps Several species have been found by Mr Angus nesting in the stems of the syringa all their nests have a family resemblance being simple tunnels with out any pretensions to architectural skill The stems of the blackberry or syringa arc often tenanted by the little green Ceratina bee Figure 249 represents a 31 320 Fig 250 Fig 249 syringa stem containing the cells of this bee separated at regnlar intervals by little parchment partitions tlie spaces between them being filled with dirt The cells are filled by the parent bee with pollen a store of food for the grub A great step in advance is the home of the carpenter bee Fig 250 which is bored in solid pine wood or even hard wood sometimes for a foot or more The work is done by the jaws of the bee and the hole is bored as evenly as by an anger After boring the hole it is partitioned off by chip walls a pellet of pollen on which the larva feeds having been previously placed in each coll Here is a specimen of mechani cal ingenuity and architec tural skill which is cer tainly surprising and in dicates some forethought Nest of and a certain degree of Ceratina reasoning power In the succeeding chapter the

entire community Let us turn again to Smeathmans work for a general view of the indoor life of this busy people this model republic whose domes rose above the tall reeds of the low Guinea coast centuries before Plato wrote his Republic Of every species says Smeathman there are three orders first the working insects which for brevity I shall generally call labourers next the fighting ones or soldiers which do no kind of labour and last of all the winged ones or iierfect insects which are male and female and capaljle of propagation These might very oppositely be called the nobility or gentry for they neither labour nor toil nor fight being quite incapable of either and almost of selfdefence These only are capable of being elected kings or queens and nature has so orderetl it that they emigrate within a few weeks after they are elevated to this state and either establish new kingdoms or perish within a day or two 21 1 322 HALF HOUIIS WITH INSECTS LPackaud Fig 251 Female worker

about one hundred laborers to one soldier The winged females are found flying about at the begin ning of the rainy season After being on the wing for a few hours they descend to the ground where they are at once attacked by the true ants which drag multitudes of them into their nests so that Srneathman remarks that it is won derful that a pair should ever escape so many dangers and get into a place of security Some however are so fortu nate and being found by some of the labouring insects that are continually running about the surface of the ground under their covered galleries which I

which these labourers protect the happv pair from their innumerable enemies not only on the day of the massacre of almost all their race but for a long time after will I hope justify nic in the use of the term election The little industrious creatures immediately enclose them in a small chamber of cla suitable to their size into Avhich at first they leave but one small entrance large enough for themselves and the soldiers to go in and out but much too 324 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS Packakd little for either of the royal pair to make use of and when necessit obliges them to make more entrances they are never larger so that of course the voluntary subjects charge themselves with the task of providing for the offspring of their sovereigns as well as to work and to fight for thera until they shall have raised a progeny capable at least of dividing the task with them It is not until this time that the nuptials of the royal pair take place The queen then lays her eggs to tlie amount of sixty in a minute or eighty tliousand and upward in one day Meanwhile the laborers having construted a small wooden nursery as before described carry the eggs and lodge them there as fast as they can obtain them from the queen These nurseries may be in some cases four or five feet distant in a straight line and consequently much farther by their winding galleries Here adds our author the young are attended and provided with everything necessary until they are able to shift for themselves and take their share of the labours of the community As an illustration of the wonderful intelligence of these social Termites as compared with that of solitary insects Smeathman in speaking of their numerous underground gal leries by which thej go about in the neighborhood of their nests with the utmost security in all kinds of weather says that if they meet a rock or any other obstruction they will make their way upon the surface and for that purpose erect a covered way or arch still of the same materials continu ing it with many windings and ramifications through large groves having where it is possible subterranean pipes run ning parallel with lliem into which they sink and save them selves

with their arched galleries they give the alarm by loud hissings which we hear 4 THE SOCIAL LIFE OF INSECTS 325 distinctly at eveiy step we make soon aftei which we may examine their galleries in vain for the insects but find little holes just large enough for them by which they have made their escape into their subterraneous roads These galleries are large enough for them to pass and repass so as to pre vent any stoppages though there are always numerous pas sengers and shelter them equally from light and air as well as from their enemies of which the ants being the most numerous are the most formidable How Avell the soldiers perform their duty and the laborers theirs is described by Smeathman who says that if you make a breach in a slight part of the building and do it quickly with a strong hoe or pickaxe in the space of a few seconds a soldier will run out and walk about the breach as if to see whether the enemy is gone or to examine what is the cause of the attack He will sometimes go in again as if to give the alarm but most frequently in a short time is followed by two or three others who run as fast as they can straggling after one another and are soon followed by a large body who rush out as fast as the breach will permit them They then attack in their blind rage whatever object they come in contact with whether the leg or foot of the curious naturalist who has made the disturbance all the time making a crackling noise with tlieir jaws beating them on the sides of the building AVhen all is quiet and before the soldiers are all inside you will see the labourers in motion and hastening in various directions towards the breach every one with a burthen of mortar in his mouth ready tempered This they stick upon the breach as fast as they come up and do it with so much dispatch and facility that although there arc thousands and I may say millions of them they never stop or embarrass one another and you are most agreeably deceived when after an apparent scene of hurry and confu sion a regular wall arises gradually filling up the chasm Other instances are given by this excellent observer in illus 5 326 tration of the wonderful exactness of the division of labor in these insects Smeathman well observes that by tiie soldiers being so ready to run out upon the repetition of the attack it appears that they but just withdraw out of sight to leave room for the labourers to proceed without interrup tion in repairing the breach and in this instance they shew more good sense than the bulk of mankind for in case of a conflagration in a city the number of people who assemlle to stare is much greater than of those who come to assist and the former always interrupt and hinder the latter in their efforts The sudden retreat of the labourers in case of an alarm is also a wonderful instance of good order and disci pline seldom seen in populous cities where we frequently find helpless people women and children without any ill intention intermixing in violent tumults and dangerous riots Smeathman then speaks of the obstacles thrown in his way while examining the nests by these intelligent crea tures in addition to the brittleness of the works inside They fight to the very last disputing every inch of ground so well as often to drive away the negroes who are without shoes and make white people bleed plentifully through their stockings Neither can we let a building stand so as to get a view of the interior parts without interruption for while the soldiers are defending the outworks the labourers keep barricading all the way against us stopping up the different galleries and passages which lead to the various apartments particularly the royal chamber all the entrances to which they fill up so artfully as not to let it be distinguishable while it remains moist How faithfully the queen is watched over by the laborers who have so many other duties to perform is very striking and is a puzzling problem to those who would take the ground that these social insects are guided alone by blind instinct or an unconscious automatism Read Smeath mails account of their doings when the rojal chamber is finall laid bare He sa3s tliat these faithful subjects never abandon their charge even in the last distress for whenever I took out the royal chamber and as I often did preserved it for some time in a large glass bowl all the attendants continued running in one direction around the king and queen with the utmost solicitude some of them stopping in every circuit at the head of the latter as if to give her something When Ihc came to the extremity of the abdomen they took the eggs from her and carried them awaj and piled them carefully together in some part of the chamber or in the bowl under or behind any pieces of broken clay Yhich lay most convenient for the purpose It is the reserve mental power shown by these insects in rising to extraordinary occasions such as these that excites our astonishment Blind instinct will serve for the per formance of the most ordinary routine work of tlieir social life but even instinct is often at fault and unless there is sometliing in these beings akin to reasoning powers one is at a loss to account for their readiness in dealing with unex pected emergencies as seen in their manner of repairing their houses IIow insects came to be social is difficult to conjecture The whole course of nature is opposed to concentrated effort on the part of animals Nature from their birth scatters them The few species of insects which are social are the exceptions to the rule as the ancient civilizations of As syria pgypt and America are phenomena exceptions to the isolated tribes and families of savage peoples existing around them The whole course of human progress tends to show that man at first lived in scattered families which gradually assembled in scanty triles drawn together for mutual protection At first the fact tliat colonies of insects exist so highly differentiated as the white ants seems one of the most potent arguments against the development hypoth 7 328 esis but on reflection Ave cannot account for their origin witliout supposing that tliey have resulted through natural laws such as have acted in building up human societies And the fact that there are all grades of complexity of social life among the Termites down to species which are nearly solitary almost on a par socially with other insects shows that these clans powerful from their superiority in numbers and intelligence have been organized in consequence of pre eminence in physical and mental qualities in the veiy face of the disorganizing forces of nature This steady advance seen in certain lines of animal life the degradation and retrogression in many others show that there is something working through and above the ordinary laws of nature which evince Infinite Power and Willforce not of the world of matter Fritz Mijller who has observed the white ants of Brazil has discovered that besides the four kinds of individuals first made known by Smeathman there are wingless males and females as well as winged ones so that the complexity of the social life of these insects is still farther increased In a published letter to Mr Darwin he remarks For some years I have been engaged in studying the natural his tor of our Termites of which I have had more than a dozen living species at my disposition The several species differ much more in their habits and in their anatomy than is gen erally assumed In most species there are two sets of neuters viz laborers and soldiers but in some species Calotermes Hag the laborers and in others Anoploter mes the soldiers are wanting With respect to these neu ters I have come to the same conclusion as that arrived at by Mr Bates viz that diflTerently from what we see in social Hymenoptera they are not modified imagos sterile females but modified larvae which undergo no further met amorphosis This accounts for the fact first observed by Lespes that both the sexes are represented among the sterile packaud the social life of IXSECTS 329 or socalled neuter Termites In some species of Caloter mes the male soldiers may even externall be distinguished from the female ones I have been able to confirm in almost all our species the fact already observed by Mr Smeathman a century ago but doubted by most subsequent writers that in the company of the queen there lives always a king The most interesting fact in the natural history of these curious insects is the existence of two forms of sexual individuals in some if not in all of the species Besides the winged males and females which are produced in vast numbers and which leaving the termitary in large swarms may intercross with those produced in other communities there are wingless males and females which never leave the termitary where they are born and which replace the winged males of females whenever a community docs not find in due time a true king or queen Once I found a king of a species of Eittenaes living in company with as many as thirtyone such complemental females as they may be called instead of with a single legitimate queen Termites would no doiibt save an extraordinary amount of labor if instead of raising annually myriads of winged males and females almost all of which helpless creatures as they are perish in the time of swarming without being able to find a new home they raised solel a few wingless males and females which free from danger might remain in their native termi tary and he who does not admit the paramount importance of intercrossing must of course wonder why this latter manner of reroduction b wingless individuals lias not long since taken the place through natural selection of the production of winged males and females But the wingless individuals would of course have to iair always with their near relatives whilst by the swarming of tlie winged Ter mites a chance is given to them for the intercrossing of indi viduals not nearly related Among the ants the colony arises in the following manner 9 330 Packaed The workers hibernate rarely the females and in spring take care of the eggs and larvse produced the previous autumn In the course of the summer the males and females appear and late in summer on warm days they fly in the air in swarras After the nuptial flight the females may be seen running about on the ground biting their wings off They enter tlie ground sometimes the old holes and lay their eggs and then die The nests of some species of ants contain several thousand individuals There are no species of true ants which construct such complex nests as the Termites but in the sociability displayed by them their love for their own kind and interest shown in other insects they far surpass their prototypes the white ants and evince a psychological development that has a human element in it which apears to be superior and superadded to the usual law of selfpres ervation and selfish instincts controlling the lower animals I shall not dwell on the ordinary life of the colony as the history of the formicarium is given in entomological works It may be observed however that the ants simply place their 3oung in underground holes not building cells for them as do the wasps and bees and that the workers are undevel oped females while in the Termites the laborers are unde veloped individuals of both sexes We will now glance at some of the liabits of ants which are the result of their living in crowded communities but are not characteristics necessary for the preservation of each and every species One trait sometimes manifested in a prosperous and rich community of men is the oppression and enslavement of their weaker neighbors So welltodo luxurious colonies of ants go on foraging expeditions and each member of the party brings home in his jaws a sable ant Our common red ant Formica sangninea which builds high hills in the woods is known to enslave a negro ant How in one instance this operates on the captors is seen in the case of the Pohjergus 10 THE SOCIAL LIFE OF INSECTS 331 rufescois ¦which is said by Mr Frederic Smith to enslave four secies of ants These slave hunters are totally unable to perform their own labor as they are incapacitated as La treille tells us on account of the form of their jaws and the accessory parts of their mouth either to prepare habita tions for their family to procure food or to feed them The sole motive says Kirby for their predatory excur sions seems to be mere laziness and hatred of labor Tliey will not move or feed themselves Iluber shut up tliirty of the slavemaker ants in a glazed box supp3ing tliem with joung of tlieir own kind and hone Many of them died of hunger and the rest seemed likely to when he introduced a single negro which restored order making a cell in the earth in which it placed the young slaveholder brood and then saved the lives of the survivors Here we have two colonies united each consisting of three sets of individuals but the complicated work of the formicary goes on without any apparent disorder such is the perfect division of labor Tliesc Ilelots build or repair the common building make excursions to collect food at tend uion the females feed them and the hirvre and if the weather be suitable daily sun the eggs larvre and pupaj The love of acquisition so common a trait with ants as seen in their storing uj seeds and enslaving other species extends to the keeping of herds of cattle namely the docile Aphides which receive the Caresses of the ants and yield up their honey dew with true bovine meekness Some under ground Aphides live in ants nests The Aphides living pri marily on the roots of vegetables it is a question whether the ants excavate their nests around the root to which the Aphides are anchored by their long beaks or whether they are introduced by tlic ants These social creatures also go so far as to keep dilTerent sorts of beetles in their nests either on the surface of the ant hill under stones or down stairs in the basement of their dwellings When alarmed 11 332 the ants may sometimes be seen running down their holes with these entomological poodles in their arms If horses and dogs fraternize and institute Platonic loves why should not the ants Such patterns of all the domestic virtues have their pets This is a bright side to the ordinary selfishness and utter absence of an moral attribute in these beings and is a makeshift for goodness of heart which should draw out our sympathy towards these creatures The ants work day and night with occasional intervals of rest and we are told by Kirby that the actually amuse themselves with sports and games A colony of ants was observed by Bonnet enjoying the sunlight one of their amusements consisting in their carrying eacli other on their backs the rider holding with his mandibles the neck of his horse and embracing it closely with his legs Huber also saw a numerous colon of Formica rufa at play I approached one da he says one of their formicaries exposed to the sun and sheltered from the north The ants were heaped together in great numbers and seemed to enjoy the temperature which they experienced at the sur face of the nest None of them were working this multi tude of accumulated insects exhibited the appearance of a boiling fluid upon which at first the eye could scarce fix itself without difficulty But when I set myself to follow each ant separately I saw them approach each other mov ing their antennte with astonishing rapidit with their fore feet they patted lightly the cheeks of other ants after these first gestures which resembled caresses they reared upon their hind legs by pairs they wrestled together they seized one another b a mandible by a leg or an antenna the then let go their hold to renew the attack they fixed themselves to each others trunk or abdomen they embraced the turned each other over or lifted each other up by turns He compares these sports add Kirby and Spence to the gambols of two puppies and tells us that he not only  333 often observed them in this nest but also in his artificial one Surel these ants exhibit nearly as much intellect as the monkeys and other animals though perhaps not so intelli gent as the domestic animals which have been educated by their intercourse with man Tlie Qcudohia Mexicana Fig 252 female has two sorts of workers the common one with a small head and the Fig 252 Fig 23 Female CEcodoinu major workers with enormous heads Fig 253 Sumi chrast says that the intelligence of these ants is wonderful They are seen in immense numbers transporting leaves to place in their nests and this is done by the same principle of the division of labor so marked in the white ants A part of these workers cut off the leaves and others collect them and carrying them off to their nests march in long processions each with a leaf over its shoulder like an umbrella hence they are sometimes called um brella ants Sumichrast says that if the tree is not too lofty one can satisfv J vorkcr CEcoiomu himself that a party of foragers which have climbed the tree occupy themselves wholly in the labor of cutting them off while at the foot of the tree are the carriers which make the journeys between the tree and the nest 13 334 HALP HOURS AVITH INSECTS Packakd Bates previously made similar statements regarding the Brazilian CEcodoma ceplialotes They have he says reg ular divisions of laborers numbers mounting the trees and cutting off the leaves in irregularly rounded pieces the size of a shilling another relay carrying them off as they fall The largeheaded individuals do not work and are only to be seen on disturbing the nest An important part of the work in some ant colonies is the storing up of seeds An East Indian ant Pheidole provi dens collects so large a store of grass seeds as to last from January and February the time of their ripening till October We have in this country an agricultural ant whose histo rian the late Dr Lincecum of Texas declares has the instinct to sow the grass from which the seeds are gathered by it He is a reliable observer and studied this ant Myr mica molefacieiis for a period of eighteen jears The asser tion that the ants actually plant the grass may be confirmed or not by future observation He makes the statement however that at the site of their nests there were little patches of the same grass scattered about on the little glade which had doubtless been planted there by some experienced ant for it had been neatly cleared of all other vegetables in fact cultivated b them He subsequentl states in the same connection American Naturalist vol viii 51G that this species of ant subsists almost entirely on small seeds great quantities of which it stores away in its gran arycells to supply food for winter During rainy seasons in the autumnal months it happens right often that the ground becoming saturated the water penetrates their gran aries and swells and sprouts their seeds In this emer gency they bring out the damaged grain the first fair daj and exposing it to the sun until near night they take in all that is not actuall sprouted I saw them in G W Gentrys farm one day have out on a flat rock as much as a gallon of 14 PACKAKu THE SOCIAL LIFE OF INSECTS 335 wheat sunning I wanted to see how the would manage to get so much back again and returned again tliat evening just in time to see tlieir hosts come out and carry it in in five minutes But Mr Moggridge the autlior of tliat entertaining book Harvesting Ants and Trapdoor Spiders lias quite dis pelled whatever doubts have arisen in the minds of modern naturalists respecting the frugal irovidcnt habits of certain ants fulh proving the accuracy of Solomons words Go to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wise which having no guide overseer or ruler provideth her meat in the summer and gathereth her food in the harvest Again The ants are a ieople not strong yet they prepare their meat in the summer Our author also juotes Hesiod Horace and Virgil as rclerring to this habit of the ants But il21ian who lived in the time of Hadrian supplies full details Moggridge quotes him as follows In summer time after harvest while the ears are being threshed the ants pry about in troops around the threshing floors leaving their homes and going singly in pairs or sometimes three together They then select grains of wheat or barley and go straight home by the way they came Some go to collect others to carry away the burden and they avoid the way for one another with groat politeness and consideration espe cially the unburdened for tlie weight carriers Now these excellent creatures when they have returned home and stored their granaries with wheat and barley bore through each grain of seed in the middle that which falls olf in the process becomes a meal for the ants and the remainder is unfertile This these worthy housekeepers do lest when the rains come the seeds sliouhl sprout as the would do if left entire and thus the ants should come to want So we sec that the ants have good share in the gifts of nature in this resect as well as others Northern observers have denied that ants lay up seeds IT 336 HALF liOUJlS WITH INSECTS Now two of these species of harvesting ants noticed by Mr Moggridge inhabit France and Switzerland as well as Italy but are not known to have this habit north of the Alps so that it appeared probable to him that they do store in the south but not in the north Here we have one of the most striking cases on record of an entire change of habit in the same species in different climates One would think that the seeds stored up in this way would germinate and be a source of trouble to the ants They treat them however in such a way as to prevent their germination Tiiousands of seeds from twentyone nests were examined and only twentyseven in seven nests sliowed traces of germination though our author on removing the seeds from the granaries and planting them found that they readily grew When he says the seeds do germinate in the nests and it is my belief that they are usually soft ened and made to sprout before they are consumed by the ants it is ver curious to see how the growth is checked in its earliest stage and how after the radicle or fibril the first growing root of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous seeds has been gnawed off they are brought out from the nest and placed in the sun to dry and then after a sufficient exposure carried below into the nest The seeds are thus in effect malted the starch being changed into sugar and I have myself witnessed the avidit with which the contents of seeds thus treated are devoured by the ants While everything may go on harmoniously in one colony ants are nevertheless extremel sensitive to the code of honor and protracted duels take place between different colonies of the same species as well as of different species Moggridge says that the most savage and prolonged con tests which he has witnessed were those in which the comba tants belonged to two different colonies of the same species Atta barbara will carry on the battle day after day and week after week I was able to devote a good deal of time to watching the progress of a predatory war of this kind waged by one nest of barbara against another and whicli lasted for fortysix days from January 18 to March 4 These wars are usually the result of thieving expeditions Tliis Atta barbara is said b IMoggridge to drill holes in the rock a fact not known to me until after the last chapter on Insects as Architects was printed In two cases sa3s our author I have found nests oi Atta barbara at Mentone which were carried far into the living rock in places where it happened to be of an even grain and not gritty or pebbly as it frequently is It was quite by chance that I first discovered this very interesting fact having tracked a train of seedbearing workers to a part of the sandstone rock where steps had quite recently been hacked out leading to some terraces At one point where the rock was almost entirely solid and without tlaw or crev ice and where it was clear that the passages were entirely the work of the ants we measured a tunnel b worming a straw down into it and found it to be ten inches in lengtli He subsequently traced this tunnel or rock gallery down until it communicated with a chamber filled with Avinged ants and seeds of several kinds This granary was horizon tal and merely an enlargement of an ordinary galler of compressed spindle shape flattened from above downwards measuring as nearly as I could estimate three inches in length by a trifle less than an inch in breadth and half an inch in height The walls were tolerably smooth but not prepared or glazed in the way that certain small terminal cells which I shall shortl describe were IMany more facts afforded by competent observers might be adduced to throw light on the interior life of these ant repullics How perfecth each one does the work allotted to it how equally the division of labor is carried out with what admirable harmony and unity of purpose all work for the common end that end the preservation and maintenance 22 17 338 of the species we have seen The subject has by no means been exhausted Over a thousand species of ants have been already described The published observations relate to but a few of this legion of specific forms In this country no observers have yet occurred except Dr Lincecum and Mr J A Allen who have published anthing worthy of note on the habits of our native species Here is a rich nnworked mine of knowledge which will afford the most interesting results to the younger naturalists of the country AVhen the good time comes that millennium of American biological science when all our species of animals shall have been classified we shall hope for good work in the field of the observation of habits The wasps are both social and solitar3 The latter build separate cells of sand or mud sometimes placing several together These cells are filled with the paralyzed bodies of caterpillars and other insects and closed up The young wasp begins life with a living supply of food at hand The larvffi at least help themselves Not so with the newl born young of the social wasps They are daily fed by the parent or worker wasp Here we come again to insects where a large part of the duties of the hive those maternal cares only evinced in other insects by the mothers themselves devolve upon a spinster race who have apparently all the labors and anxieties with out the realities of maternity What a strange phenomenon this possession of the mental traits of the softer sex if that term will apply to these insects for the Avorkers sting while the males are harmless without the ower of transmitting them The simplest form of nest in the social wasps which we have in the United States are those of the Polistes which consist of a number of cells attached by a common stalk to the branch of some bush the entire nest being large enough to cover a third of ones hand the cells being placed mouth 18 THE SOCIAL LIFE OF INSECTS 339 downwards I have noticed in Virginia during the last week in April three species of Polistes beginning their nests and working in the same manner I never saw the nests at an earlier stage than when consisting of three cells but it was easy to see tliat the first cell was only partially built before the other two were begun and that virtually the wasp builds the three cells almost simultaneously Tlie outer edges of the incipient cells are said by Waterhouse to be perfectly circular but at the time I saw them they were slightly angular on the outer edge and by the time the cells are nearl completed the hexagonal form of the cells is attained The wasp thus changes her plan of working be ginning to build them saucershaped then cupshaped and finally forming them into deep hexagonal tubes But one wasp a female which has hibernated builds a cell Now this act of building the sixsided cell is in the wasps of the present day purely instinctive but I firmly believe that when nature had the ancestors of these wasps in training the built rude solitary more or less silierical cells and only as the force of surrounding circumstances made them social did they build more than one cell and put them together when they were obliged partly by the necessity of mathe matical laws acting in a degree under the control of their reason to build them in hexagons There are social bees such as the humble bees in which the cells made by the larvie are oval though closely pressed together Wh do not they assume a hexagonal form if this is due simply to mechanical pressure But look at the adult honey ee or the Meliiona or Trigona wliich build hexagonal cells They are not wholly the instruments of mechanical laws but prob ably had in the earlier histor of the species sulllcient intel lect to enable them to build their cells in hexagons I am induced to take this view from seeing the wasp change its plan of building from a circular to a hexagonal one as the cells grow higher and become more numerous These crea 19 340 tures are in a sense free agents and are able to make a slight use of physical laws through the exercise of reason It is probable that after thousands of generations these habits at first slowly and painfully acquired have become moulded into instincts sometimes even nowadajs at fault For wasps and bees may make mistakes as well as men My assertions would assume the form of arguments could I lay before the reader the multitudes of shapes in which wasps and bees build their nests The gradations from the simple nests of the solitary wasps up to the complicated enormous nests of some species of Vespa are manifold and are evidences that their different styles of architecture are outgrowths of a single simple spherical cell each kind dif fering according to the intellectual traits of its builder and the peculiar exigencies of its life The cells of these wasps though for the most part con structed of bits of wood and the bark of trees gnawed off by the wasp are in their earliest stages largely composed of silk secreted in the salivary glands of the wasp Perhaps chewing this woody matter promotes a freer flow of the se cretion At any rate the silk is plastered on thickly bj the wasp She is very careful to have the common pedicel by which the cells are suspended of great strength it must therefore consist almost entirely of silk I have watched a Polistes by the hour plastering the pedicel with silk going over it with its tongue and proving its work with its sensi tive antennae which rapidly patted the work as if they were fingers By the time three cells are perhaps onehalf made the wasp lays an egg at the bottom of two of them by the time the fifth cell is partly completed the four others each con tain an egg As the cells increase in number through the industry of the parent more eggs are laid The young hatch from the eggs first laid and now the duties of the parent wasp are doubled She feeds the young with flies 20 THE SOCIAL LIFE OF INSECTS 341 and other insects often aiding tlie butelier by flying off with the blowflies that spoil his meat Here is a field for the exercise of the wasps reasoning powers impelled and guided as they are by her primary parental instincts It is in the minor doings the accidents of life so to speak that their reasoning powers are brouglit into action Most of mankind live by their instincts rather than their reason They labor in the same fashion as their grandfathers as for instance in farming men till the ground in the same fashion as their forefathers and when quickwitted persons those who use their perceptive and reasoning faculties endeavor to improve upon the customs of the olden time everybody knows how hard it is to have them changed Their primitive mode of farming from becoming habitual becomes instinctive and often nothing but the love of money the selfish principle stronger in some men than the love of their kind gets them out of the ruts when from being qiasi creatures of a blind instinct unconscious automata they with others aid in the advancement of their race So there are philosophers and reformers who do the thinking for the masses And some thing of this kind must go on in the animal world or there never would have been progress upwards in the animal scale Some new exigency due to a change in their ihysical en vironment arises when a new line of action is begun re sulting in a new set of habits new instincts and new species the physical embodiments of the novel intellectual qualities characterizing the new creations In about a month a brood of workers appear Thoy at once aid the old queen in building more cells and now the nests incicase more iapidly in size The material for them is mostly taken by the workers from the bark of trees or the palings of fences the wasp gnawing them off with her large heavy jaws In this way the great hornets within the last ten or fifteen 3ears in the vicinity of New York have actu ally scraped off the bark of lilacs so as to disfigure them 21 342 Packaud But nature has prohibited them from rearing offspring of their own They feed the 3oung and watch over them until a new brood apiears late in the summer The famil circle is now completed A few females and males appear and linger on until the early frosts of autumn kill the latter when their wives take shelter under leaves or in cracks under the baik of trees there to await the warmer days of spring The paper making wasps various species of Vespa as soon as a tier of cells is partially built begin to build out a wall of paper from near the base of the pedicel This grows more and more as the cells iucrease in number when arranged in several tiers sup ported by pedicels they are completely walled in by the intelligent wasps The nests of the common wasp which Vespa maciilata builds about houses are seldom larger than ones fist but the nests of the Vespa maculata Fig 254 are twice as large as ones head All wasps are not makers of paper The oriental wasp Vespa orientalis builds its cells of cla and according to Waterhouse the work is exceedingly beautiful and true Another species sajs Mr Frederic Smith of the British Museum makes its nest of sandy loam the exterior being so hard that a saw used in opening one of its sides was blunted Among the social wasps there are two series and it is difficult to say which is the higher in fact the Hymenoptera as a group may be compared to a tree the topmost branches no one more preeminent than the others representing the social species The ants are fully as intelligent their social life as fully if not more complex than that of the wasps or 22 PuicAui THE SOCIAL LIFE OF INSECTS 343 liecs We may siiy that there is a parallelism in the intel lectual life as well as physical forms of these insects In the tioics there are social wasps with exceedingly numerous colonies Such is the Nectarina a plumpbodied visp which in Mexico huilds a large nest externally like that of a wasp but more irregular and with the walls con sisting of but a single layer The interior of the nest is ver dilferent the galleries of cells instead of being parallel being arranged in concentric spheres The papiermache wasp as we may call it or Chartergns chartarlns makes a nest of the consistency of the densest pasteboard which is attached by a broad base to the bough of a tree and is about twice as long as thick ending in a cone in which is the entrance from which is a passage from the middle to the basal gallery while the other galleries are formed ly a con tinuation of the sides of the nest and arranged in a conical plane The Tataa morio of Cayenne builds a nest somewhat like tliat of the 2Kpiermache wasp but the galleries form a flat floor and each gallery has a separate entrance from the outside of the nest The nest of the social Synoica cyanea is formed b a single layer of cells fixed against the trunk of a tree and protected by a dense covering made from the bark of dead trees some nests being three feet long There are numerous less social species belonging to the genera Apoica Icaria etc which luild uncovered nests of but few cells but those distinctly hexagonal tliese form a connect ing link between the populous nests we have just described and the solitary mud cells of the Oduerus and Kumenes Turning now to the bees we find an attempt at sociability in the nests of the Aiulrana viciiia a common bee in the northern states which ma best be described by saying that it is of the size and general appearance of the hone bee Mr Emerton has observed its habits quite closely and made the accompanying drawing of its cells The nest may be 23 344 L Fig 2 detected by its resemblance to an ants nest as the bee in burrowing throws up a small hillock of sand First she burrows straight down for two or three inches and then turn ing off a little forms a cell as at a Fig 255 where she deposits a mass of pollen as large as a pea and lays an egg upon it By the time this has hatched and the larva has passed into its pupal sleep as at a several other cells have been excavated the lowest one of course being the most recent In the figure the low est cell contains only the freshly laid pollen cell at e an egg is represented as laid by the bee on the upper surface of the mass while the partly grown larva is repre sented at I lying on its side devouring the pollen Avhich has as seen at b been eaten up the grub now being fully grown and ready to pass into the pupa state The little mason bee may be said to be social in some degree She builds her urn shaped earthen cells of clay or fine mud in tunnels or holes sometimes in empty snail shells The little green Osmia sim illima our commonest species of mason bee sometimes places four or five of her clay cells in deserted galls as in Fig 256 24 Audiena vicma packaijd the social life of ensects 345 The leaf cutter or tailor bee is also partly social in so far that it makes a munber of cells and places them close together in the hollow of the branch or stalk of some pithy plant such as the elder but like the Andrena and mason bee there is no combination of two or more indiviiluals as in the trul social wasps and bees The leafcutter bee some times builds as many as thirty cells arranged end to end Usually however but a few cells are made Fig 257 repre sents three such cells in the stem of an elder stalk I am not aware that there is any other bee which at all Fig 256 Cells of Mason Bee iu a srall approaches the tailor bee in the unique habit of cutting out circles from rose leaves and so adjusting them as to form a cartridge like cylinder Fig 258 represents the bee in the act of cutting out these circles The act is as deliberate and methodical as that of the Attelabus the weevil which so caie fully cuts and rolls up the leaf into a solid carliidgelike mass in which to deposit its eggs It also invariably so far as I am aware selects the rose A single bee in one in stance as observed by Mr F W Putnam cut out at least 25 346 Fig 257 a thousand such leaves with which to construct her cells The cell is filled with pollen and an egg is deposited on the mass before it is finally closed Another species of Megachile M hrevis in Canada ac cording to Mr E B Reed cuts circular pieces from the leaves of the plum tree and also rolls up the leaves of the tree as a covering for its nest Mr W M Davis Jr tells me that he has observed a leaf cutter bee cutting pieces out of the leaves of the sassafras and during his residence in Cordoba South America he found several nests of a Megachile in a bank the cells of which were formed of the 3ellow petals of a species of poppy In India besides certain species of Megachile which build cells of rose leaves one species M proxima cuts the leaves of the Clitoria creeper there are others which form them of mud According to Messrs Home and Smith the MegacliUe Janata builds in different objects within or about houses Both sexes appear to labor The mud is car ried under the head and in part sup ported by the fore legs and these authors believe that when the cla having been first prepared at the water is brought into use it is inspissated with some glutinous substance ejected by the insect It is certainly very carefully kneaded again by many of the claycellbuilders The Megachile disjuncta has the same habits as the Woolly Megachile A large proportion of the wild bees nest in the ground like the Andrena a few bees like the cuckoo live a parasi tic life in the cells of other bees It is not well understood what their young feed on but it seems most probable that 26 CeUs of Leaf Cutter Bee pacivakd the social life of insects 347 Fig 258 they do not attack the larva of their hosts but steal their beebread The bumble or humble bee is truly social and yet in a manner quite its own Besides the males and queens there are a large number of workers but they do not assist in building any cells as the larvae in part make their own cells The habits of the humble bees in this country have been studied with much attention by Mr Putnam He shows b independent observation that the queen which has hiber nated after selecting a site for her nest in an abandoned mousesnest or stump collects a small mass of pollen mixed with honey and in this deposits from seven to fourteen eggs grad ually adding to the pollen mass until the first brood is hatched Now it seems that as soon as the grubs begin to eat they make cavi ties in the mass and when fully grown spin an oval cocoon about them Thus the act of building these oval cells is a purely mechan ical one These grubs are in truth unconscious automata They how ever are in a degree aided by the queen who strengthens the thin walls of the cell by covering them witii a thin layer of wax The cells form an irregular mass but however thickly crowded together always retain tiieir oval form Fig 259 2 showing eggs laid in a pollen mass on one end of a cell It is this fact which leads us to believe that the wasp or honey bee in building its sixsided cells did so in the begiitning from design however instinc tive the act now is and that the are not compelled to do so unconsciously and in obedience to certain laws of me chanics which they are forced to follow The mechanical theory of the formation of the bees cell 27 Leaf Cutter IJee at work 348 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS Fig 259 Ccliri of Humble Bee has been most ably advocated by the Rev Samuel Haughton His view is that the hexagonal form of the cell may be accounted for simply b the mechanical pressure of the in sects against each other during the formation of the cell In consequence of the instinct that compels them to work with reference to a plane and of the cylindrical form of the insects body the cells must be hexagonal Now this view would scarcely apply to the hexagonal cells of the Avasps nests at the period when only three cells have been made and a single wasp is the builder nor to the nest of Icaria giMatipennis where six cells are arranged in a single row and attached to a branch by a slender stalk at one end of the row In this instance also there is no crowding together of several indi viduals working simultaneously but a solitary wasp freely building her hexagonal cells without being subject to me chanical constraint If there was not the agency of mind in the operation super added to the reproductive instinct which primarily impels all the insect world to action we should never have had an ad vance beyond the humble bee stage So among the wasps if they had alwa3s solely lived on the principle of each one pro viding for itself if the reproductive and selfish instincts alone held sway we should never have seen wasps building cells in common under a common shelter and working together for the common good of all The whole course of nature tends to establish the fact that in the early history of the sport or variety which gave rise to the species as we now find it some bees more quickwitted than others struck out in new directions took a step in advance of their fellows See the figure in my Guide to the Study of Insects Pi 5 and hit on a plan of building which proved advantageous to the species when Nature stamped her approval of the reform by preserving the species in the condition we now behold When the workers appear they aid in bringing home sup plies of pollen and hone but do not build and in fact the humble bee is not much of an architect In the stingless bees Melipona and Trigona of the trop ics however we have a high degree of architectural skill shown in the construction of their cells The domestic Melipona of Mexico constructs combs of hexagonal cells smaller though like those of the honey bee but they also have large irregular roundish cells an inch in diameter which serve as honey pots According to Fritz Mijller who has observed these bees in southern Brazil the wax is secreted on the upper side of the abdomen instead of the under as in the hive bee The wax is usually darkcolored but sus ceptible of bleaching He also states that while the larvae of the hone bee are fed ly the laborers at first with semi digested food and afterwards with a mixture of pollen and honey and while the cells are closed only where the larva aiC fullgrown the Melione and Trigonre on the con trary fill the cells with semidigested food before the eggs are laid and they shut the cells immediately after the queen has dropped an egg on the food With hivebees the royal cells in which the future queens have to be raised differ in their direction from the other cells this is not the case with Melipona and Trigona where all the cells are vertical Avith their orifices turned upward forming horizontal or rarely spirally ascending combs The colonics of these bees are exceedingly populous the workers being numbered by the thousands Smith says that Mr Stretch who lived at Panama described a hive that he saw occupying the interior of a decaying tree that meas ured six feet in length and the multitude of bees he com pared to a black cloud This colony belonged to a species 29 350 HALF HOURS AVITH INSECTS of Trigona Both this and Melipona are supposed to have more than one queen in a colon The mode of nesting in tiiese bees is very unlike in dif ferent species Many species build in the hollow trunks of trees others in banks some suspend their nests from branches of trees whilst one species constructs its nest of clay it being of large size Gardner It is but a step from the stingless bees to the hive bee and the wild species of which there are at least five The economy of the hive bee is so well known that I shall here only notice some of the habits of the wild species of the East Indies the home of all the species of Apis Wallace says that true honeybees are found in the west ern half of the Archipelago and in the southeast as fir as Timor where however it is possible that they may have been introduced Ajyis dorsafa and A testacea both con struct large combs suspended from the underside of the branches of lofty foresttrees They sting very severely yet the natives ascend the trees and with nearly naked bodies take away the combs protected only by a smoulder ing torch the smoke from which in some degree keeps off the insects The Dyaks of Borneo ascend the trees by driving strong pegs of bamboo into the trunk which they connect with an upright bamboo and thus form a good lad der The people of Timor literally walk up the trees by means of a long piece of creeper put round them and the extremities held in the hand It is a wonderful sight to see a man ascend thus a vertical trunk one hundred feet high and then creep out upon a horizontal branch and coolly brush away the myriads of bees from a comb a yard in diameter and become immediately enveloped in a cloud of anory insects while he cuts off the comb and lets it down to his companions below by a slender cord In this manner many tons of wax are annually collected the immature bees and honey supplying a luxurious feast to the beehunters 30 IACKAKD THE SOCIAL LIFE OF IISECTS 51 How the domestic liivebee builds its cells lias been dis cussed by Mr Darwin in the Origin of Species His theory seems to combine the iurel3 mechanical views of Haughton and Walcrhouse with the view that the bee un consciousl takes advantage of modifications of simple primitive architectural instincts such as many other insects possess If I understand his theory aright it implies that the bee by the very act of taking advantage of the simple instincts must in the nature of the case act as an intelligent agent He thus sums up the leading points in his theory Thus as I believe the most wonderful of all known in stincts that of the hivebee can be explained by natural selection having taken advantage of numerous successive slight modifications of simpler instincts natural selection having by slow degrees more and more perfectly led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given distance from each other in a double layer and to build up and excavate the wax along the planes of intersection the bees of course no more knowing tliat they swept their spheres at one particular distance from each other than they know what are the several angles of the hexagonal prisms and of the basal rhombic ilates the motive power of the process of natural selection having been the construction of colls of due strength and of the proper size and shape for the larvie this being effected with the greatest possible economy of labor and wax tliat individual swarm which tlms made the best cells with least labor and least waste of honey in the secretion of wax having succeeded best and having trans mitted by inheritance their newly acquired economical in stincts to new swarms which in their turn will have had the best chance of succeeding in the struggle for existence IMr Darwin has noticed the objection to such a theory in the fact that bees have a capacity of laying down under certain circumstances a rongii wall in its proper place be tween two justcommenced cells which is important as it 31 35 l3ears on a fact which seems at first quite subversive of the foregoing theory namely that the cells on the extreme margin of waspscombs are sometimes strictly hexagonal This seems to me as already stated in the Guide to the Study of Insects a fatal objection to any purely mechanical theory and I cannot but regard the method of building in hexagons as demanding in the first bee which built its cells in this fashion as much reasoning power as the beaver exerts in planning its dams and who will affirm after reading Mr Morgans work on the beaver that this animal is guided purely by a blind instinct or is an unconscious machine  IT is almost invariably the case that those who have closely observed and recorded the habits of animals nenrl always express their surprise at the high degree of intelligence exhibited by them and do not hesitate to state their opinion that animals are provided with some degree of reasoning power while others still more confi dent declare that this intelligence differs only in degree from that of man himself The works of DeGeer Reaumur Huber Bonnet and of later eminent observers of the habits of insects express the view that they exhibit more or less of a reasoning power On the other hand there are many generally those who have not personally observed the doings of animals and are biassed by considerations to which it is needless here to allude who are very strong in the faith for it is not with them a matter of observation or experiment that animals act simply by blind instinct that they are machines automata When asked how animals sometimes act in a manner so akin to that of man the only reasoning beino according to their view in existence the answer that they are taught by Divine Power This with them Is the end of the matter except that they seem indignant that any lower animal should for a moment be regarded as in any way allied to themselves as if the intellectual and moral standino of man is at all compromised by allowing that the animals possess intelligence and at periods act as if influenced by reason We have no controversy with those who believe that the instincts of animals have been implanted by the Creator as we are of the same opinion The question simply is 23 1 354 what is the kiiicl of mind possessed by animals have they a slight degree of reasoning power are they in some degree free agents And how did the instincts which all agree they possess originate We shall attempt to answer these ques tions speaking on this occasion simply in behalf of the insects As to the domestic animals the horse dog and others which by association with man have undergone a certain amount of education there are few people exercising their perceptive and reasoning faculties who do not ascribe to these animals a degree of reasoning power which they do not confound with their ordinary instinctive acts Confining our attention to the insects let us in an unprej udiced way examine this matter and ascertain what faculties resembling those of man they possess Our conclusions will have a degree of uncertainty and be based mainly on proba bilit so that there is little occasion for dogmatism Our space is not extended and in laboring to be brief we may seem but not intentionally to be dogmatic Those who observe the ways of insects have noticed their extreme sensitiveness to external impressions that their mo tions are ordinarily rapid and nervous Look at the ichneu mon fly as it alights on a leaf near a caterpillar With what rapid motions it walks and flies about how swiftly its feelers vibrate how briskly it walks up and down surveying its vic tim Look at a mud wasp as it alights near a pool of water to moisten its mouth How nervous are its motions how nimbly it flies and runs about the edge of the water The ant is a busy active dapper little creature a nervous brusque ness pervading its movements How susceptible insects are to the light may be tested on a damp dark night by opening the windows In dart a legion of insects of all sorts each with a different mode of entrance some beetle boldly flying about the room in its blundering noisy flight or a Clisio campa moth enters with a bound and series of somersaults over the table like the entree of a popular clown into the 2 Packaud mental powers OF INSECTS 355 ring of a circus though the latter may have the most self possession of the two In his Observations on Bees and Wasps Sir John Lub bock says that though bees do not come out at night they seem to be much affected by light One evening I lit a small covered lamp to go down to the cellar A bee which was out came to it and flying round and round like a moth followed me the whole of the way there Insects are like most animals extremely sensitive to elec trical phenomena Just before a thunder shower they are particularly restless flying about in great numbers and with out an apparent object The appendages of insects their feelers and their legs must be provided with exquisitely sen sitive organs to enable them to receive impressions from without Everybod knows that insects have acute powers of sight That they also hear acutely is a matter of frequent observa tion Often in walking through dry bushes the noise of ones feet in crushing through the undergrowth starts up hosts of moths disturbed in their noonday repose If insects did not hear acutely why should the Cicada have such a shrill cry For whose ears is the song of the cricket designed unless for those of some other cricket All the songs the cries and hum of insect life have their purpose in nature and are use less unless they warn off or attract some other insect We know with a good degree of certainty that some insects have an acute sense of smell The carrion beetles scent their booty afar off the ants the moths all the insects attracted to flowers b the smell of the honc in them evi dently have well developed organs of smell Insects evidently have like man perceptive faculties Let us now examine the organs of sense and the nervous system of insects and thus approach the subject of the instinctive and reasoning powers of these animals from the side of anatomy and physiology 356 HALF IlOUPtS WITH IXSECTS Fig 260 copied from a drawing by Prof Leidy repre sents the nervous system of a neuropterous insect the Coiy dalus figured on page 151 The central nervous system is a double cord enlarged at intervals forming nerve centres or ganglia of which there are sometimes thirteen pairs A Fig 260 Russian anatomist OfTsianni koff has found that the gan glion of a spiny lobster Pali mirus is composed of nucle ated cells from which arise ver long fibres which are gath ered into bundles forming the nerves ramifying tluoughout the bod There is thus a direct physical communication telegrnphic Avires as it were loading from all parts of the body to these nervecentres Of these there are two pairs lodgctl in the head the most anterior those situated in the top of the head are the larger and are for convenience called the biain but it will be seen that though thc are a little larger they do not differ from the other pairs of nerve cen tres From this socalled brain are distributed nerves to the Nervous System of Corydaius antenuffi the palpi and jaws a large thick nerve sent to the eye is the optic nerve a From the other nervecentres filaments are thrown out to the wings legs muscles and vessels in the body We shall see that these centres are really so many brains and that insects differ in this respect from the vertebrate animals in 4 Packakd mental powers OF IXSECTS 357 which there is a true brain or mass of ganglia lodged in the skull or brainbox though it may be added that the spinal cord is in a degree a nervous centre in itself The large e3es of insects are made up of a great number of simple eyes the optic fibres from each one of these simple ecs indicated externally by facets uniting to form a com mon nerve connecting with the brain How large may be sometimes the number of simple eyes united to form this composite eye is seen in a certain butterfly which has 17355 of them The eye of the dragon fly consists of 12544 while the eye of the common house fly has 4000 fiicets or cornese In these insects the composite eyes are exceed ingly large sometimes as in the house fly or dragon fl forming the greater part of the bulk of the head Tliere is every reason from the complicated structure of the eye which we will not here describe and from the movements of these insects to infer that they have acute powers of sight Even certain low insects and the young of the higher ones in which the eyes are rudimentary and single have it is known from experiment the power of distinguishing light from darkness a matter of considerable importance to these insects which mostly move about at night While the eyes in insects are invariably situated on the head this is not the case with a large number of little sense organs which are found in the antennae and the palpi or feelers attached to the accessory jaws maxillae and the under lip labium These minute organs consist of a little cavity covered by a membrane which is supposed to act as a tympanum In connection with the cavity is a nerve which runs to a gang lion When there are a number of these microscopic sense organs placed together the nerves iroceeding from them unite to form a common fibre as in the antennal nerve This sense apparatus is supiosed to be usually auditory in its function as it is in some form or other almost invariably 5 358 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS found in the antennae Similar organs also occur at the end of the palpi I have found a similar isolated sac on the under side of both the labial and maxillary palpi of a Perla Fig 99 It is probable that this is an olfactor organ and placed on the under side of the feeler next to the mouth so as to enable the insect to select its proper food by its odor giving an additional sensory function to the palpi of insects which are supposed to be organs of touch In the blow fly there are a number of these organs situ ated at the base of the wings and near tiie spiracles or breathing holes Similar organs are found in the wings of the carrion beetles and are supposed to be olfactory in their function There are also sense organs probably ears on the fore legs of certain species of grasshoppers Sense organs even occur in tiie jointed appendages of the hind body or abdomen Our attention was first called to this fact by the discoverj by Dr Dohrn of sense organs in the jointed appendages of the mole cricket Stimulated by this I examined the long slender jointed feelers of the cockroach and to my great joy found ninetyfive of these little pits on one and one hundred and two on the other It is evident that the crea ture is provided with a double set of antennae one on the head and another on the tail True abdominal antennae seem also to occur on the abdomen of the Mantis I have also found sense organs similar in appearance on the abdominal appendages of a fly Chrysopila and it is not improbable that these organs will be found in similar situations in other insects They are thus scattered at ran dom as it were over the surface of the body No wonder that insects are so alive to impressions from without Without much doubt the nerves distributed to tliese or gans are nerves of special sense and as the ganglia from which they arise may be situated near the end of the abdo men or in the thorax as well as in the head it appears that 6 MENTAL POWERS OP INSECTS 359 this chain of ganglia is really a series of brains so that if insects think at all the process is carried on in the abdomen as well as the trunk or the head This accounts for the fact that when insects are deprived of their head or abdomen they will sometimes continue to live for man hours They still have a few pairs of brains left 80 also when the sand wasp stings the caterpillar or spider in the thorax its whole body is paralyzed Probably the brain proper is never injured as the sting is not known to penetrate the head The hairs of insects found scattered over the body par ticularly those on the feelers and the more exposed parts of the bod are often provided with a nerve and are exceed ingly delicate tactile organs Mr R Beck suggests that spiders are capable of distinguishing sounds to some extent by means of very delicate waving hairs which are found on the upper surfaces of their legs During life they move at their peculiarly cupshaped bases with the least motion of the atmosphere but are immovable after death It is well known that sound is due to vibrations which are generally conveyed by undulations of the air now I am perfectly satisfied that if these undulations are of a certain character the hairs I am alluding to upon the spiders leg will move and I wish you particularl to notice that they are of differ ent lengths so that some might move whilst others would not and also that the longest is at the extremity of the leg and therefore can receive an undulation which miglit die away higher up I may thus mention that there is a group of these peculiar hairs on the flea The legs of a siider are most sensitive organs of feeling if they do not also embrace those of hearing The reader is by this statement reminded of the interesting discovery of Dr Johnson confirmed and extended by Professor A M Mayer regarding the sense of hearing in the mosquito which we have already referred to in a previous chapter 360 We have endeavored to establish the fact that insects are extremely sensitive to impressions made by external objects upon the senses Using the language of the mental philoso phers who divide the human mind into the sensibilities the will and the intellect any one will grant that insects are certainly endowed with sensibilities the first subdivision of the intellect Having perceived an object or received an impression on its organs of smell or hearing such as the odor of deca3ed carrion or of a flower the carrion beetle or bee immediately flies to the object How strong impulses arise from this acuteness of the sense of smell in the carrion beetle is shown by the following fact mentioned by Kirby and Spence A German naturalist Gleditsch relates that he one day spitted a toad on a stick which he fixed upright in the ground A number of burying beetles Necrophoriis ves pillo came around it but as they could do nothing with the toad while in the air they mined under the base of the stick till it fell and then buried toad and stick together Some insects are found in the flowers of plants which have the smell of carrion and frequent no oilier plants Here is certainly a power of choice an act of volition the insect rejects pleasant smelling flowers for bad smelling ones This act involves however not only powers of the will but of the intellect also as the very fact of its making a clioice proves that different odors affect it and that it selects a certain odor in preference to another The flesh fly has been known to be so misled by the odor of bad smelling plants that it has laid its eggs in the flowers of Stapelia hir suta instead of carrion Kirby and Spence If any one should have the hardihood to deny that insects exercise powers of volition that in other words they do not follow the lead of their senses acute as we now know they are let him catch an humble bee between his fingers and see if the creature hesitates to use its sting He will very soon 8 MENTAL POWERS OF INSECTS 3GI realize that the bee has a will of its own and that her will acts with a promptness and decision which at once appeals to the sensibilities of tlie experimenter But bees sometimes attack persons whom they seem to dislike or cluster as it were lovingly about one for whom they have some sort of regard Is not this an act of volition of the exercise of a will added to an operation of the intellect In illustration of this power of discrimination between their friends and enemies I borrow the following anecdote from the Rev J S AVatsons work on the Reasoning Power of Animals It may well be considered an indication of reason in bees that they know as is confidently asserted their master or the person who chiefly attends to them A singular state ment to this effect is given in Stedmans Voyage to Suri nam I was visited at my hut says Mr Stedman whose words I abridge by a neighboring gentleman who had no sooner entered than he leaped out again ioaring like a madman with pain and ran off to the river to plunge his head into the water The cause of his distress was that being a tall fellow he had struck his head against a large nest of wild bees which had built in the thatch I apprehen sive of a similar attack withdrew immediately from the hut and ordered the slaves to demolish the bees nest without delay They were just going to do so when an old negro came up and declared that tlic bees would never sting me personally offering to undeigo any punisliment if one of tliem ever did so Massa said the negro the would have stung you long ago had you been a stranger to them but being your tenant and allowed to liiill upon your premises they know both you and yours and will never hurt eitiier you or them This Mr Stedman found to be the case for even after shaking the nest the bees would sting neither him nor his negroes The same old negro told Mr Stedman that he had lived on an estate on which there was 9 362 a large tree in which there had been as long as he could remember a society of birds and another of bees living together in the greatest amity for if an strange birds molested the bees the birds on the spot drove them off in a body and if strange bees came near the birds nests the native bees attacked them and stung them to death The family of the owner he said had so much regard for the harmonious colonies that they considered the tree sacred Aside from mere physical stimulation such as the recep tion and appreciation of sounds smells and changes from light to darkness to which nearly all insects are subject close observers have told us that insects sometimes give every appearance of being subject to the passions Tiiey not only have strong reproductive instincts but undoubtedly a hungry tiger beetle is a very cross creature a maddened ant is a terror to a barefoot boy who treads carelessly on its hill and a terrified or angry humble bee buzzes with an intensit that proves that it has suffered a considerable shock to its feelings That bees do become angry is indicated by a different pitch to their hum Landois calculating the rapidit of the vibrations by the sound produced thereby states that the fly which produces the sound of F vibrates its wings 352 times a second and the bee which makes the sound of A 440 times a second On the contrary a tired bee hums on E and therefore vibrates its wing only 330 times in a second This difference is probably involuntary but the change of tone is evidently under the command of the will and thus offers another point of similarity to a true voice A bee in the puisuit of honey hums continually and contentedly on A but if it is excited or angry it pro duces a very different note Thus then the sounds of in sects do not merel serve to bring the sexes together they are not merely love songs but also serve like au true lan guage to express the feelings Sir John Lubbocks address 10 rACKARu MENTAL POWERS OF INSECTS 3G3 before the London Entomological Society 1868 But be sides all this we know that ants engage in sports that they wrestle and toss each other about in a playful wa as evi dently so as that young dogs or cats play with one another Insects of all animals must experience pleasure or pain in accordance with extremes of cold or heat They play only when stimulated by the rays of a hot sun Bees as Lubbock observes have a variable temper Generally they allowed me to handle them without an sign of irritation while at other times without an reason which I could discover the stung me sometimes several times in a day they seemed the more prone to do so the hotter the weather If it were not for their sensitiveness to pleasure and pain the instinct of selfpreservation so powerful with animals and which would cease to operate unless their willforce was strongly developed would cease to be exerted Kants expression Pleasure is the feeling of the furtherance pain of the hindrance of life applies to insects as well as men Tiie fact that insects must at times enjoy a warm sunny day that they have what we call animal spirits is a proof that they have not only feelings and will but possess intelligence and possibly in a slight degree self consciousness Having seen that insects have acute sensibilities that they see hear smell and feel witli sudicient acutcness to enable them to maintain their existence we have the foundations laid b wliich their will may operate That insects have a certain amount of willforce that they can act with energ and decision when their feelings are shocked that when pleasurable sensations arise they indulge those emotions for a longer or shorter time seems to be susceptible of proof Now granted that insects have sensibilities and will how Quoted by Mr 5ain in liis INIinil and ISody Aiipletond lutcrnational Sei entiflc Series are we to prove that they have an intellect Simply by observing whether they make a choice between two acts On entering a closet ants unhesitatingly direct their steps to the sugar bowl in preference to the flour barrel one sand wasp prefers beetle grubs to caterpillars to store up as food for her young In short insects exercise discrimination and this is the simplest of intellectual acts They try this or that method of attaining an object In fact an insects life is filled out with a round of trials and failures That they have the quality of perseverance in a high degree is proved ly the statements of many observers In building her nest how many unsuccessful attempts the spider often makes before she finally succeeds in properly fastening her threads the frame work of her web Robert Bruce is said to have admired the perseverance of a spider after repeated failures indeed the persevering labors of the ant ihe bee or the fly are matters of daily observation As an illustration of the perseverance shown by ants combined with the faculty of the communication of ideas which they possess to such a high degree is the experiment performed by Mr Jesse I have often put he says a small green caterpillar near an ants nest jou may see it immediately seized by one of the ants who after several ineffectual efforts to drag it to its nest will quit it and go up to another ant and they Avill appear to hold a conversa tion togctlicr by means of their antennne after which they will return together to the caterpillar and bj their united efforts drag it where they wish to deposit it Another fact in illustration of the same qualities is af forded by Kirby and Spence A German artist a man of strict veracity states that in his journey through Italy he was an eyewitness to the following occurrence He ob served a species of Scarabaeus Atetichus pilularius busily engaged in making for the reception of its egg a pellet of dung which when finished it rolled to the summit of a small hillock and repeatedly suffered to tumble down its side ap parently for the sake of consolidating it by the earth which each time adhered to it During this process the pellet un luckily fell into an adjoining hole out of which all the efforts of the beetle to extricate it were in vain After several in effectual trials the insect repaired to an adjoining heap of dung and soon returned with three of his companions All four now applied their united strength to the pellet and at length succeeded in pushing it out which being done the three assistant beetles left the spot and returned to their own quarters That the bee makes a choice is seen in the perforation of a flower when she cannot or will not reach the nectary by walking into the corolla The case observed by Mr Bailey already referred to on page 202 is in point lie observed humble bees which were baffled in their attempts to find the hone take a short cut and perforate the corolla with their jaws Here is an act of the will carried on under the stim ulation of the organs of smell Now as regards the act of choosing between two alternatives some bees are more intel lectual than otliers and the fact that there is a decided dif ference between two bees in this respect is additional proof that they have a reason In an article on the fertilization of various flowers by in sects in the Popular Science Review Dr Ogle refers to tliis well known habit of both humble and hive bees of either perforating the flowers of the bean or getting at the honey by entering the mouth of the corolla He noticed that while some bees visit the blossom in the natural way and in so doing take pollen from the anthers of one flower to the stigma of the next others avail themselves of the shorter cut but tliat an individual bee visiting a succession of boan flowers uniformly does one or the other It would thus appear that the habit is not an instinct belonging by inheri tance to the whole species but is in each case the result of 13 366 individual experience As with tlie same experience some bees liave acquired tlie habit and otliers liave not we must admit not only that these insects are intelligent but that they differ from each other in their degrees of intelligence some being slow in acquiring knowledge others quiclver The scarlet runner when the bloom is covered with gauze to keep off insects is wholly sterile and so indeed habitually are a good many of the uncovered blossoms The latter is probably owing to the observed fact that most bees have learned to get at the nectary by nipping the tube Were all bees equally clever there would be an end of scarlet runners unless indeed either nature or artifice were to induce some modification of structure by which the tube might be pro tected and the bees again driven to the mouth The following instances are taken from Kiiby and Spence and are we believe the earliest cases of this habit on record M P Huber in his valuable paper in the sixth volume of the Linnean Transactions states that he has seen large humble bees when unable from the size of their head and thorax to reach the bottom of the long tubes of the flowers of beans go directly to the calyx pierce it as well as the tube with the exterior horny parts of their proboscis and then insert their proboscis itself into the orifice and extract the honey They thus flew from flower to flower piercing the tubes from without and sucking the nectar while smaller humble bees or those with a longer proboscis entered in at the top of the corolla Now from this statement it seems evident that the larger bees did not pierce the bottoms of the flowers until they had ascertained by trial that they could not reach the nectar from the top but that having once as certained by experience that the flowers of beans are too straight to admit them they then without further attempts in the ordinary way pierced the bottoms of all the flowers which they wished to rifle of their sweets M Aubert du PetitThouars observed that humble bees and the carpenter bee Xylocopa violacea gained access in a similar manner to the nectar of Antirrhinum Linaria and majus and Mirah ilis tTcdappa as do the common bees of the Isle of France to that of Canna nidica and I have myself more than once noticed holes at the base of the long nectaries of Aquilegia vulgaris which I attribute to the same agency Another instance of change of habit by the individuals of a species is afforded in the same work we quote the fol lowing statement from Sturm It is the instinct of Geo trupes verncdis to roll up pellets of dung in each of which it deposits one of its eggs and in places where it meets with cow or horsedung onl it is constantly under the necessity of having recourse to this process But in dis tricts where sheep are kept this beetle wisel saves its labor and ingeniously avails itself of the pellet shaped balls ready made to its hands wdiicb the excrement of these animals supplies Another instance where choice is made between two alter natives is stated by Mr Darwin In liis Origin of Species he gives the following account One of the strongest instances of an animal apparently performing an action for the sole good of another with which I am acquainted is that of aphides voluntarily yielding as was first observed by Iluber their sweet excretion to ants that they do so voluntarily the following facts show I removed all the ants from a group of about a dozen aphides on a dockplant and prevented their attendance during several hours After this interval I felt sure that the aihides would want to excrete I watched them for some time through a lens but not one excreted I then tickled and stroked them with a hair in the same manner as well as I could as the ants do with their antennae but not one excreted Afterwards I allowed an ant to visit them and it immediately seemed by its eager way of running about to be well aware what a rich Hock it had discovered it then began to play with its antenniu on 15 368 the abdomen first of one aphis and then of another and each as soon as it felt the antennae immediately lifted up its abdomen and excreted a limpid drop of sweet juice which was eagerly devoured by the ant Even the quite joung aphides behaved in this manner showing that the action was instinctive and not the result of experience It is certain from the observations of Huber that the aphides show no dislike to the ants if the latter be not present they are at last compelled to eject their excretion But as the excre tion is extremely viscid it is no doubt a convenience to the aphides to have it removed therefore probably they do not excrete solely for the good of the ants Although there is no evidence that any animal performs an action for the exclusive good of another species yet each tries to take advantage of the instincts of others as each takes advan tage of the weaker bodily structure of other species That there is much difference among individual ants Dr Lincecum has affirmed in his article on the Agricultural Ant in the eighth volume of the American Naturalist I have recently discovered he sas a great difference in their mental operations and capacities Individuals there are which possess great intellectual superiority to the com mon laboring classes which is manifested in the fact that they assume the leadership in all their important public works and army movements Some are much more saga cious and cautious in avoiding traps and dangerous contri vances set for them by the scarcely superior human genus One of our Germans invented a very destructive ant trap It is set over the entrance to their city and is so contrived that going or coming it is sure to entrap them but not all of them Occasionally a well formed fellow is observed to arrive at the top of the precipice where he stops and gravely and cautiously suiveys the awful abyss below filled with frantic and terribly distressed thousands who have incau tiously precipitated themselves into inevitable ruin and after viewing the dreadful and disastrous condition of liis fellow laborers he seems to understand the true nature of the mis fortune and turning from tlie irremediable calamity hastens down tiie inclined plane into the grass weeds le3ond the reach of further observation Quite a number of them were seen to examine and hastily fly from tlic entrance of this destructive trap That this story is not overdrawn is proved ly a similar experience of Mr J D Hague of San Francisco related in Nature April 10 1873 Being annoyed ly thirty or forty ants on a shelf he killed some and maimed others The effect of this was immediate and unexpected As soon as tliose ants that were approaching arrived near to where their fellows lay dead and suffering they turned and fled with all possible haste In half an liour the wall alove the mantelshelf was cleared of ants During the space of an hour or two the colony from below continued to ascend until reaching the lower beveled edge of tlie shelf at which point the more timid individuals although unable to see the vase somehow became aware of trouble ami turned about without further investigation while the more daring advanced hesitatingly just to tlie upper edge of the shelf where extending their antennae and stretching their necks they seemed to peep cautiously over the edge until beholding their suffering companions when they too turned and followed the others expressing by their ehavior great excitement and terror An hour or two later the path or trail leading from the lower colony to the vase was almost entirely free from ants I killed one or two ants on their path striking them with ray finger but leaving no visible trace The effect of this was that as soon as an ant ascending towards the shelf reached the spot where one had been killed it gave signs immediately of great disturbance and returned directly at the highest speed possible 24 17 370 A curious and invariable feature of tlieir behaAior was that wlieu such an ant returning in fright met another ap proaching the two would always communicate but each would pursue its own way the second ant continuing its journey to the spot where the first had turned about and then following that example ¦For several days after this there were no ants visible on the wall either alove or below the shelf Then a few ants from the lower colony began to reappear but instead of visiting the vase which had been the scene of the disaster they avoided it altogether and following the lower front edge of the shelf to the tumbler standing near the middle made their attack upon that I repeated the same experi ment here with precisely the same result Killing or maim ing a few of the ants and leaving their bodies about the base of the tumbler the others on approaching and even before arriving at the upper surface of tlie shelf where their mutilated companions were visible gave signs of intense emotion some running away immediately and others advanc ing to where they could survey the field and then hastening away precipitately Occasionally an ant would advance towards the tumbler until it found itself among the dead and dying then it seemed to lose all selfpossession running hither and thither making wide circuits about the scene of the trouble stopping at times and elevating the antennoe with a movement sug gestive of wringing them in despair and finally taking flight After this another interval of several days passed during which no ants appeared Now three months later the lower colony has been entirely abandoned Occasionally however especially when fiesh and fragrant violets have been placed on the shelf a few prospectors descend from the upper nail hole rarel almost never approaching the vase from which they were first driven away but seeking to satisf their desire at the tumbler To turn back these stragglers tind keep tliem out of sight for a number of das sometimes for a fortniglit it is sufficient to kill one or two ants on the trail whicli they follow descending the wall This I have recently done as high up as I can reach three or four feet above the mantel The moment this spot is reached an ant turns abruptly and makes for home and in a little while there is not an ant visible on the wall Sir John Lubbock who has studied the ways of ants remarks that it is wonderful how much individual ants appear to differ from one another in character Instinct is known in a few cases among insects as well as other animals to be variable This is probably due to their power of discrimination such as the higher animals un doubtedly possess It has been asked sa3s Mr Darwin that if instinct be variable why the ability to use some other material when wax is deficient has not been granted to the bee But he answers what other material could bees use They will work with and use as I have seen wax hardened with vermilion and softened with lard Andrevv Knight observed that his bees instead of laboriously collect ing propolis used a cement of wax and turpentine with which he had covered decorticated trees It has lately been shown that bees instead of searching flowers for their pollen will gladly use a ver different substance namely oatmeal These instances seem to show that insects take the most advantageous means offered to them by nature for the ac complishment of their ends that the individuall exercise a choice and that instinct varies in different individuals of a species Within an exceedingly limited range insects exer cise choice and are free agents They adapt themselves to new circumstances and while there is perhaps little or no progress in the minds of individual animals they somehow as a class keep pace with a changing progressive world No one will deny that creation has not been tending up wards that higher forms of animal life have not on the 19 372 HALF HOURS WITH rNTSECTS whole succeeded the lower How could this have been brought afbout unless animals were provided with a variable instinct Indeed those who deny animals reason admit as an alternative that instinct is not always invariable But how can instincts vary unless insects have in a slight degree the power of discrimination Mr George H Lewes in an article on Instinct in Na ture April 10 1873 has well summed up this subject of choice or discrimination in the following words To con clude when there is no alternative open to an action it is impulsive where there is or originally was an alternative the action is instinctive where there are alternatives which may still determine the action and the choice is free we call the action intelligent It follows that if insects do choose between two courses of action they have the power of perceiving the likeness between two objects For example a white butterfly has been seen to suddenly change its course and fly down to a piece of white paper It perceives a similarity between the paper and one of its own species or perhaps to a cruciferous flower on the leaves of which it lajs its eggs If it were not for this principle how could insects recognize others of their own species It is obvious that insects have this prin ciple of similarity strongl developed Were it not for this mental quality the species would die out By means of this power the bee recognizes its companions and also by this power of identification or recognition it finds its hive after leaving it out of sight for a long time It is well known that bees and other insects may be lost When they first begin to fly from the hive they go but a little distance and act as though fixing the landmarks in their mind Making longer flights they familiarize themselves with the ground over which they fly until to those who have not known how this power of finding their way home has been attained the act seems purely instinctive and not one of individual odueation Whether this is not the basis of the viigratonj sense as we may call it of birds is worth inquiry As an illustration of this power of recognition in the crabs tlie next class below insects the following statement of Mr Robert Fox of Falmouth England is contributed by Mr P W Cox to Nature April 3 1873 The fisher men of Falmouth catch their crabs off the Lizard rocks and thoy are brought into the harbour at Falmouth alive and impounded in a box for sale and the shells are branded with marks by which eevy man knows his own fish The place where the box is sunk is four miles from the entrance to the harbour and tliat is above seven miles from the place where they are caught One of these boxes was broken the branded crabs escaped and two or three days afterwards tlie were again caught by the fislierman at the Lizard rocks They had been carried to Falmouth in a boat To regain their home they had first to find their waj to the mouth of the harbour and when there how did they know whether to steer to the right or to the left and to travel seven miles to their native rocks But bees could not find their way home from a distance of several miles unless they possess memory the third divi sion of the intellect Unless insects possess memorj which consists in storing up in the mind possibly through some change in the struc ture of the nervous system the results of external impres sions we are at a loss to conceive how they can discriminate or perceive the points of resemblance between two objects aficr having been out of sight of them for a greater or less length of time We arc therefore a priori led to suppose that all insects have memor Bain defines memor acqui sition or retention as being the power of continuing in the mind impressions that arc no longer stimulated by the same agent and of recalling them afterwards by purely mental forces This definition will hold in insect as well as human 21 374 L psychology How a bee can return to its hive from afar unless it remembers the way back we cannot understand It does not explain the fact to say that it is instinctive or due to some impulse The impulse is present but it simply urges the insect to start on tlie road memory aided by dis crimination and the sense of similarity show the bee how to perform the journey and select its own hive from among the others near it We may with Kirby and Spence not believe that the bee is guided liome by varied scents but in llogers fine lines can exclaim Who guides the patient pilgrim to her cell Who bids her soul with conscious triumph swell With conscious truth retrace the mazy clue Of varied scents that charmd her as she flew Hail Memory hail I tliy universal reign Guards the least link of IJeings glorious chain No automaton could find its way back to a point from which it had once started however well the machine had been originally wound uj Nor does the common notion of an inflexible instinct meet the case Memory is often due to a repetition of certain experiences and experiences lay the foundation for instinctive acts it is the sum of these inherited experiences which make up the total which passes under the name of instinct That bees previous to flying away for long distances ob serve closely the surrounding objects wliich serve as land marks or guideposts seems proved by the statement of Huber that if a hive be removed out of its ordinary posi tion the first da after this removal the bees do not fly to a distance without having visited all the neighboring objects The queen does the same when flying into tlie air for fecun dation Does not the bee act in the same manner as we would do on leaving for the first time a hotel in a strange city We mentally construct a topographical map as we walk away from the house in order to readily find our way 22 MENTAL POWERS OF ENSECTS 375 back Are not the mental processes the same in kind how ever different in degree But sa3s our author from wliom we have borrowed the suggestions just made the most striking fact evincing tlie memor of these last mentioned insects has been commu nicated to me by my intelligent friend Mr William SticI ne of Ridgcmont Ilolderness About twenty years ago a swarm from one of this gentlemans hives took possession of an opening beneath the tiles of his house Avhence after remaining a few hours they were dislodged and hived For many subsequent years when the hives descended from this stock were about to swarm a considerable party of scouts were observed for a few days before to be reconnoitring about the old hole under the tiles and Mr Stickney is per suaded that if suffered they would have established them selves there He is certain that for eight 3ears successively the descendants of the very stock that first took possession of the hole frequented it as above stated and not those of any other swarms having constantly noticed them and as certained that they were bees from the original hive by powdering them while about the tiles with yellow ochre and watching their return And even at the present tiuie there are still seen every swarming season about the tiles bees which Mr Stickney has no doubt are descendants from the original stock Had Dr Darwin been acquainted with this fact ho would have adduced it as proving that insects can convey traditionary information from one generation to another and at the first glance tlie circumstance of the descendants of the same stock retaining a knowledge of tlie same fact for twenty years during which period there must have been as many generations of bees would seem to warrant the iufer ence But as it is more prolable that the party of survey Dr Erasmus Darwin Uie graiulfatlier of the author of tlic Origiu of Species 23 376 ing scouts of the first generation was the next year accom panied by others of a second who in like manner conducted their brethren of the tliird and these last again others of the fourth generation and so on I draw no other conclu sion from it than that bees are endowed with memory which I think it proves most satisfactorily The daily acts of a bee are quite complicated if we take into account all the journeys it makes the pollen and honey it collects the complicated process of loading itself with the mass which it collects with its tongue rearranges by means of its jaws transfers from the fore to the hind feet and piles up on its shallow honeybasket Then think of the far more difficult operations that it carries on within the hive How are the impressions gained in its first days flight pre served and not only this but transmitted to its descendants I am now speaking of the queen humble bee or wasp The only theory that seems to account satisfactorily for these acts is the physical theory of some physiologists as Beale that every mental act is accompanied by a change in the cells of the nerve centres This is largely a matter of spec ulation and must be regarded as such Professor Bain has from the facts afforded by Beale been led to make a hypo thetical comparison between as he says these two things our acquisitions on the one hand and the nervous elements of the brain on the other He supposes that with a total of 200000 acquisitions of the assumed types which would certainly include the most retentive and most richlyendowed minds there would be for each nervous grouping 5000 cells and 25000 fibres Now this is hypothesis mere guess work as the author avows but based on anatomical facts Using this hypothesis simply for the purpose of illustration if these figures represent in a rude and meagre way the number of cells and acquisitions in the brain and mind of man how exceedingly small must be the number of cells and acquisitions in a bees brain and mind We know from  anatomical investigations that the number of nerve cells in the small ganglia of the bee must be very small perhaps a few hundreds at the most on this hypothesis the number of acquisitions must be correspondingly small Now there is not the differences between the brains of insects that there is in vertebrate animals There is a great uniformity in the size of the nerve centres of different insects and on ana tomical grounds there would seem to be a reason for assert ing that insects can never progress in intellect much beyond their present status We are only endeavoring to prove that insects have the primary intellectual divisions of the human mind but the chasm that still separates man from the lower animals is vast in its width and depth If we approach the subject fiom the side of anatomy and physiology the method is far less materialistic than that of him who advocates the view that animals are automata and act through instinct alone Having attempted to show that insects have a mind in its threefold divisions of the sensibilities will and intellect and supported in this view by the opinions of the ablest natural ists and philosophers let us look at some secondary mental characteristics resulting from the mutual operation of all these primary deiartments of the mind and which insects seem to have in common with ourselves From some facts previously stated it seems well estab lished that antG and a few other insects have the highly com plicated mental power of communicating their ideas to one another Dr Franklin believed that ants had this power and to put the matter to a test he put a little earthen pot containing some treacle into a closet where a number of ants soon congregated and began to prey on the contents When it was all eaten the Doctor cleared the pot of the ants and putting some fresh treacle into it susiendcd it by a string from a nail in the ceiling By chance a single ant remained in the pot which ate as long as it thought proper  but when it wanted to get away it could not for some time find the means It ran about the outside of the pot in per plexity but at last it found the way up the string to the ceiling along which it ran to the wall and so to the ground It had scarcely been half an hour gone when a numerous swarm of ants came into the closet climbed up the wall to the ceiliug and then descended by the string into the pot There they continued to eat till the treacle was all devoured each taking his departure when he was satisfied and one party running up the string and the other down Wat sons Reasoning Power in Animals There are other anecdotes on record more or less founded on observation and experiment which confirm the prevalent idea regarding this complicated mental process Sir John Lubbock has called in question in his Observations on Bees and Wasps the statements made by other observers that bees and wasps have this facult3 He made a number of experiments which in opposition to the statements of Huber and Dujardin seem to show that wasps and bees do not convey to one another information as to food which they may have discovered This does not necessarily oppose the view that these insects may communicate to one another the presence of danger In a later communication to the Linnifian Society of London as reported in Nature but not yet published in full Lubbock has recorded a number of experiments on ants which certainly seemed to show that whatever may be the case with bees ants do possess the power of communicating detailed facts to one another How insects can exist in colonies without this power is a pertinent question That individual insects undergo a process of education seems to be established from the fact that the social bees can be domesticated The honey bee is the only domestic insect we have Besides the AjjIs mellijica the Apis clorsata A inclica and A nigrocincta of India and the Apis fasci 26 MENTAL POWERS OP INSECTS 379 ata of Egypt arc domesticated in those countries and there are two or three other species not domesticated whose lioney and wax are used by the natives of the countries they in habit The Melipona doniestica is said b Iluber to be as its specific name indicates domesticated by the Mexicans Huber in his entertaining paper figures a long cylindrical clay nest which the natives of Tepic keep hanging up in their houses some of these nests are known to be over a century old so that it seems probable that the bees have for several centuries been in a state of domestication Another trait of much interest Avhich seems to result from its social life is that the honey bee ventilates its hive by fanning its wings This may be regarded as a simply in stinctive process but it appears to us an unusual act and one resulting from some degree of ratiocination Many animals are excellent mimics and it is a question whether the faculty of imitation is not very well developed in social insects Indeed were it not for this trait how could ants and bees act with that unanimity of iurpose which distinguishes their insect republics and which is the chief bond of action among them Were it not for this principle the life of the colony and of the species would soon come to an end After having in an imperfect manner gone over some of the obvious mental traits of the insects and which seem to our apprehension to be only properly classified as reasoning processes the question arises whether in performing some of the more unusual feats of mental strength such for example as communicating their ideas to one another they may not have a dim consciousness of what tliey are doing To talk of communicating their ideas without some degree of con sciousness during the act would seem illogical Whether insects are wholly dominated by an unconscious intelligence I leave for others better qualified than myself to judge meanwhile one in view of known psychological facts cannot 27 380 help suspecting that at times even insects know what they are doing while performing extraordinary superinstinctive acts Locke and Dugald Stewart says Brodie in his Mind and Matter do not allow that brute animals have the power of abstraction Now taking it for granted that abstraction can mean nothing more than the power of comparing our conceptions with reference to certain points to the exclusion of others as for example when we consider color without reference to figure or figure without reference to color then I do not see how we can deny the existence of this faculty in other animals any more than in man himself In this sense of the word abstraction is a necessary part of the process of reasoning which Locke defines as being the per ception of the agreement or disagreement of our ideas Brodie then observes that Dugald Stewart does not mean to deny that brute animals are capable of the simpler forms of reasoning Watson says that Locke was not unwilling to allow beasts a portion of reason for though he says they have no power of abstraction or use of language to increase their ideas yet if they are not mere machines we cannot deny them to have some reason and for his own part he adds it seems as evident that they do some of them in certain cases reason as that they have sense Now all that has been said regarding the intelligence of insects serves simply to pave the way for a consideration of the nature of instinct While engaged in collecting the material for this chapter and putting it in form this thought has often recurred if insects have sufficient intelligence to meet the extraordinary emergencies of their lives why may not their every day their socalled instinctive acts requiring a minimum of intellectual work have originated in previous generations and thus the instincts of the present genera tion be the sum total of the inherited mental experiences of former generations Indeed can there be any other rational explanation of that complex of mental processes we call instinct Insects in the first place act from impulse urged on b their appetites thus far they arc unconscious automata These automatic actions are due probably to reflex nervous acts and to the stimulation of their reproductive and other animal appetites upon meeting with the objects of their desires These reflex actions of the nervous ganglia arc essential for the maintenance of the life of the individual and of the species They do not come properly under the head of purely instinctive acts There are a great many acts however to which tlie term instinctive will appl3 As an example to show how many different instinctive acts may be performed by the individuals of a single species I will avail mself of the enumerations made by Kirbyand Spence occasionally condensing his language Beginning then with the formation of the colony By one instinct bees are directed to send out scouts previously to their swarming in search of a suitable abode and by another to rush out of the hive after the queen that leads forth the swarm and follow wherever she bends her course Having taken pos session of their new abode whether of their own selection or prepared for them by the hand of man a third instinct teaches them to cleanse it from all impurities a fourth to collect propolis and with it to stop up every crevice except the entrance a fifth to ventilate the hive for preserving the purit of the air and a sixth to keep a constant guard at the door In constructing the houses and streets of their new cit or the cells and combs there arc probably several distinct instincts exercised but not to leave room for objection I shall regard them as the result of one onl 3ct the opera tions of polishing the interior of the cells and soldering their angles and orifices with propolis which arc sometimes not undertaken for weeks after the cells are built and the 29 382 obscure but still more curious one of Aarnishing them with the 3ellow tinge observable in old combs seem clearly referable to at least two distinct instincts In their outofdoor operations several distinct instincts are concerned By one they are led to extract honey from the nectaries of flowers by another to collect pollen after a process involving very complicated manipulations and requir ing a singular apparatus of brushes and baskets and that must surely be considered a third which so remarkably and beneficially restricts each gathering to the same plant It is clearly a distinct instinct which inspires bees with such a dread of rain that even if a cloud pass before the sun they return to the hive in the greatest haste and that seems to me not less so which teaches them to find their way back to their home after the most distant and intricate wanderings When they have reached the hive another instinct leads them to regurgitate into the extended proboscis of their hungry companions who have been occupied at home a por tion of the honey collected in the fields and another directs them to unload their legs of the masses of pollen and to store it in the cells for future use Several distinct instincts again are called into action in the important business of feeding the young brood One teaches them to swallow pollen not to satisfy the calls of hunger but that it may undergo in their stomach an elabor ation fitting it for the food of the grubs and another to regurgitate it when duly concocted and to administer it to their charge proportioning the supply to the age and condi tion of the recipients a third informs them when the young grubs have attained their full growth and directs them to cover their cells with a waxen lid convex in the male cells but nearly flat in those of the workers and by a fourth as soon as the young bees have burst into day they are im pelled to clean out the deserted tenements and to make them ready for new occupants 30 MENTAL POWEKS OF INSECTS 383 Numerous as arc the instincts I liave already enumerated the list must yet include those connected with that m3steri ous principle which binds the working bees of a hive to their queen the singular imprisonment in which they retain the 3oung queens that are to lead off a swarm until their wings be sufficiently expanded to enable tliem to fl the moment they are at liberty gradually paring away the waxen wall that confines them to their cell to an extreme thinness and only suffering it to be broken down at the precise moment required the attention with which in these circumstances they feed the imprisoned queen by frequently putting honey upon her proboscis protruded from a small orifice in the lid of her cell the watchfulness with which when at the period of swarming more queens than one are required they place a guard over the cells of those undisclosed to preserve them from the jealous fury of their excluded rivals the exquisite calculation with which they invariably release the oldest queens the first from their confinement the singular love of monarchical dominion by which when two queens in other circumstances are produced they are led to impel them to combat until one is destroyed the ardent devotion which binds tliem to the fate and fortunes of the survivor the dis traction which they manifest at her loss and their resolute determination not to accept of any stranger until an interval has elapsed sufficiently long to allow of no chance of the return of the rightful sovereign and to omit a further enumeration the obedience which in the utmost noise and confusion they show to her wellknown hum I have now instanced at least thirty distinct instincts with which every individual of the nurses amongst the work ingbees is endowed and if to the account be added their care to carry from the hive the dead bodies of any of the com munity their pertinacity in their battles in directing their stings at those parts only of the bodies of their adversaries which are penetrable by it their annual autumnal murder 31 384 HALF HOTJKS WITH INSECTS of the drones etc etc it is certain that this nnmber might be very considerably increased perhaps doubled Most though perhaps not all of these acts are as purely instinctive as any one can imagine all bees do them in nearly the same inanner and as readily the moment they leave their cells as a few days or weeks after Such acts may be called automatic though not so much so as the process of walking flying running and biting their pre They may be accomplished by the reflex action of the nerve centres in the insects of the present generation though in the beginning secondarily reflexive As regards the ordinary instinctive acts one may quite agree with Descartes that insects are automata But the matter does not rest here There is a history we beaevc yet to be written in the light of facts which remain to be discov ered by patient observation of the origin of animal instincts and which will tend to prove that instincts ma be regarded in most cases at least as the sum of inlieritcd experiences Lamarck believed that instincts were due to certain inhe rent inclinations arising from habits impressed upon the organs of the animals concerned in producing them INIr Darwin combats Lamarcks view which he calls the well known doctrine of inherited habit as advanced by Lamarck Rev J J Murphy in his Habit and Intelligence leads us to infer that he regards instinct as the sura of inherited habits lie well remarks and this is the sum of the whole matter reason differs from instinct only in being con scious Instinct is unconscious reason and reason is con scious instinct This is tantamount to sajnng that the instinct of the present generation of insects is unconscious automatism but that their ancestors who first learned by experience how to build for example hexagonal cells were taught by reason were conscious intelligent agents and this is where we would leave the subject
