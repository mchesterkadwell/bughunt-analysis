Chapter that but little preface is needed  Its main object is to acquaint young people with the  structure and habits of the lower forms of life and  to do this in a more systematic way than is usual in  ordinary works on Natural History and more simply  than in textbooks on Zoology  For this reason I have adopted the title Life  and her Children to express the family bond uniting  all living things as we use the term Nature and her  Works to embrace all organic and inorganic pheno  mena and I have been more careful to sketch in  bold outline the leading features of each division  than to dwell upon the minor differences by which it  is separated into groups  I have made use of British examples in illustration  wherever it was possible and small specimens of most  of the marine animals figured may be found upon  our coasts at low tide  In conclusion I wish to express my great obligation to Mr R Garnett of the British Museum for his  most kind assistance in finding works of reference on  the special subjects and to many men of science  especially Mr Lowne FRCS and Mr Haddon Demonstrator of Comparative Anatomy at Cambridge  for their valuable criticisms on the proofsheets  The Illustrations of the marine animals have been  drawn by Dr Wild artist of the Challenger Expedi  tion and those of the insects by Mr Edwin Wilson  to both of whom my thanks are due for the care  and assiduity with which they have carried out my  instructions  CONTENTS  CHAPTER I  PAGE  LIFE AND HER CHILDREN i  CHAPTER II  LIFES SIMPLEST CHILDREN HOW THEY LIVE AND MOVE  AND BUILD 14  CHAPTER III

AND HER CHILDREN  CHAPTER I  Wisdom and Spirit of the Universe  Thou Soul that art the Eternity of Thought  And givst to forms and images a breath  And everlasting motion WORDSWORTH  WONDER whether it ever  occurs to most people to con  sider how brimful our world is  ju of life and what a different place  it would be if no living thing had  ever been upon it From the time  we are born till we die there is  scarcely a waking moment of our  lives in which our eyes do not  rest either upon some living thing  or upon things which have once  been alive Even in our rooms  the wood of our furniture and our  doors could never have been with  out the action of life the paper on our walls the  carpet on our floors the clothes on our back the  cloth upon the table are all made of materials which  life has produced for us nay the very marble of  our mantelpiece is the work of once living animals  and is composed of their broken shells The air we  breathe is full of invisible germs of life nor need  we leave the town and go to the country in search  of other living beings than man There is scarcely  a street or alley where if it be neglected for a  time some blade of grass or struggling weed does  not make its appearance pushing its way through  chinks in the pavement or the mortar in the wall  no spot from which we cannot see some insect creep  ing or flying or spinning its web so long as the  hand of man does not destroy it  And when we go into the quiet country leaving  man and his works behind how actively we find life  employed Covering every inch of the ground with  tiny plants rearing tall trees in the forest filling the  stagnant pools full of eager restless beings anywhere  everywhere life is at work Look at the little water  beetles skimming on the surface of the shady wayside  pool watch the snails feeding on the muddy bank  notice the newts putting their heads above water  to take breath and then remember that besides these  and innumerable other animals visible to the naked eye  the fairyshrimp and the waterflea and other minute  creatures are probably darting across the pond or  floating lazily near its surface while the very scum  which is blown in ridges towards one corner of the  pool is made up of microscopic animals and plants  Then as we pass over plain and valley and  mountain we find things creeping innumerable both  small and great some hidden in the moss or the thick  grass rolled up in the leaves boring into the stems  and trunks of trees eating their way underground or  into even the strongest rock while others such as  the lion the tiger and the elephant roaming over  Africa and India rule a world of their own where  man counts for very little Even in our own thickly  peopled country rabbits multiply by thousands in  their burrows and come to frolic in the dusk of  evening when all is still The fieldmice land and  water rats squirrels weasels and badgers have their  houses above and below ground while countless in  sects swarm everywhere testifying to the abundance of  life Not content moreover with filling the water  and covering the land this same silent power peoples  the atmosphere where bats butterflies bees and  winged insects of all forms shapes and colours  fight their way through the ocean of air while birds  large and small sail among its invisible waves  And when by and by we reach the sea we find  there masses of tangled seaweed the plants of the  salt water while all along the shores myriads of  living creatures are left by the receding tide In  the rocky pools we find active life busily at work  Thousands of acornshells many of them scarcely  larger than the head of a goodsized pin cover the  rocks and wave their delicate fringes in search of food  Small crabs scramble along or swim across the pools  sandskippers dart through the water feeding on the  delicate green seaweed which in its turn is covered  with minute shells not visible to the naked eye and  yet each containing a living being  Wherever we go living creatures are to be found  and even if we sail away over the deep silent ocean  and seek what is in its depths there again we find  abundance of life from the large fish and other mon  sters which glide noiselessly along lords of the ocean  down to the jellymasses floating on the surface and  the banks of rocky coral built by jelly animals  in the midst of the dashing waves There is no  spot on the surface of the earth in the depths of  the ocean or in the lower currents of the air which  is not filled with life whenever and wherever there is  room The one great law which all living beings  obey is to increase multiply and replenish the  earth and there has been no halting in this work  from the day when first into our planet from the  bosom of the great Creator was breathed the breath  of life the invisible mother ever taking shape in  her children  No matter whether there is room for more living  forms or not still they are launched into the world  The little seed which will be stifled by other plants  before it can put forth its leaves nevertheless thrusts  its tiny root into the ground and tries to send a  feeble shoot upwards Thousands and millions of  insects are born into the world every moment which  can never live because there is not food enough for  all If there were only one single plant in the whole  world today and it produced fifty seeds in a year  and could multiply unchecked its descendants would  cover the whole globe in nine years But since  other plants prevent it from spreading thousands and  thousands of its seeds and young plants must be  formed only to perish In the same way one pair  of birds having four young ones each year would if  all their children and descendants lived and multi  plied produce two thousand million in fifteen years f  but since there is not room for them all but a very  few must die  What can be the use of this terrible overcrowding  in our little world Why does this irresistible living  breath go on so madly urging one little being after  another into existence Would it not be better if  only enough were born to have plenty of room and  to live comfortably  Wait a while before you decide and think what  every creature needs to keep it alive Plants it is  true can live on water and air but animals cannot  and if there were not myriads of plants to spare in  the world there would not be enough for food  Then consider again how many animals live upon  each other if worms snails and insects were not  overabundant how would the birds live upon what  would lions and tigers and wolves feed if other  animals were not plentiful while on the other hand  if a great number of larger animals did not die and  decay what would the flesh feeding snails and  maggots and other insects find to eat And so we  see that for this reason alone there is some excuse  for the overabundance of creatures which life thrusts  into the world  But there is something deeper than this to con  sider If in a large school every boy had a prize  at the end of the halfyear whether he had worked  or not do you think all the boys would work as  hard as they do or learn as well If every man  had all he required and could live comfortably and  bring up his children to enjoy life without working  for it do you think people would take such trouble  to learn trades and professions and to improve them  selves so as to be more able than others Would  they work hard day and night to make new inven  tions or discover new lands and found fresh colonies  or be in any way so useful or learn so much as they  do now  No it is the struggle for life and the necessity  for work which makes people invent and plan and  improve themselves and things around them And  so it is also with plants and animals Life has to  educate all her children and she does it by giving  the prize of success health strength and enjoyment  to those who can best fight the battle of existence  and do their work best in the world  Every plant and every animal which is born upon  the earth has to get its own food and earn its own  livelihood and to protect itself from the attacks of  others Would the spider toil so industriously to  spin her web if food came to her without any  exertion on her part Would the caddis worm  have learnt to build a tube of sand and shells to  protect its soft body or the oyster to take lime from  the seawater to form a strong shell for its home if  they had no enemies to struggle against and needed  no protection Would the bird have learnt to build  her nest or the beaver his house if there was no need  for their industry  But as it is since the whole world is teeming  with life and countless numbers of seeds and eggs  and young beginnings of creatures are only waiting  for the chance to fill any vacant nook or corner  every living thing must learn to do its best and to  find the place where it can succeed best and is least  likely to be destroyed by others And so it comes to  pass that the whole planet is used to the best advan  tage and life teaches her children to get all the good  out of it that they can  If the ocean and the rivers be full then some  must learn to live on the land and so we have for  example seasnails and landsnails and whereas  the one kind can only breathe by gills in the water  the other breathes air by means of airchambers  while between these are some marsh snails of the  tropics which combine both and can breathe in both  water and air We have large whales sailing as  monarchs of the ocean and walruses and seals fish  ing in its depths for their food while all other  animals of the mammalian class live on the land  Then again while many creatures love the bright  light others take advantage of the dark corners  where room is left for them to live You can scarcely  lift a stone by the seaside without finding some  living thing under it nor turn up a spadeful of  earth without disturbing some little creature which  is content to find its home and its food in the dark  ground Nay many animals for whom there is no  chance of life on the earth in the water or in the  air find a refuge in the bodies of other animals and  feed on them  But in order that all these creatures may live  each in its different way they must have their own  particular tools to work with and weapons with  which to defend themselves Now all the tools and  weapons of an animal grow upon its body It  works and fights with its teeth its claws its tail its  sting or its feelers or it constructs cunning traps  by means of material which it gives out from its own  body like the spider It hides from its enemies  by having a shape or colour like the rocks or the  leaves the grass or the water which surround it It  provides for its young ones either by getting food for  them or by putting them even before they come out  of the egg into places where their food is ready for  them as soon as they are born  So that the whole life of an animal depends upon  the way in which its body is made and it willlead  quite a different existence according to the kind of  tools with which life provides it and the instincts  which a long education has been teaching to its  ancestors for ages past It will have its own peculiar  struggles and difficulties and successes and enjoy  ments according to the kind of bodily powers which  it possesses and the study of these helps us to under  stand its manner of existence  And now since we live in the world with all  these numerous companions which lead many of  them such curious lives trying like ourselves to make  the best of their short time here is it not worth  while to learn something about them May we not  gain some useful hints by watching their contrivances  sympathising with their difficulties and studying  their history And above all shall we not have  something more to love and to care for when we  have made acquaintance with some of Lifes other  children besides ourselves  The one great difficulty however in our way is  how to make acquaintance with such a vast multitude  Most of us have read anecdotes about one animal or  another but this does not give us any clue to the  history of the whole animal world and without some  such clue the few observations we can make for our  selves are very unsatisfactory On the other hand  most people will confess that books on zoology where  accounts are given of the structure of different classes  of animals though very necessary are rather dull  and do not seem to help us much towards under  standing and loving these our fellowcreatures  What we most want to learn is something of the  lives of the different classes of animals so that when  we see some creature running away from us in the  woods or swimming in a pond or darting through  the air or creeping on the ground we may have an  idea what its object is in life how it is enjoying  itself what food it is seeking or from what enemy  it is flying  And fortunately for us there is an order and  arrangement in this immense multitude and in the  same way as we can read and understand the history  of the different nations which form the great human  family spread over the earth and can enter into their  feelings and their struggles though we cannot know  all the people themselves so with a little trouble we  may learn to picture to ourselves the general life  and habits of the different branches of the still  greater family of Life so as to be ready by and by  to make personal acquaintance with any particular  creature if he comes in our way  This is what we propose to do in the following  chapters and we must first consider what are the  chief divisions of our subject and over what ground  we have to travel It is clear that both plants and  animals are the children of Life and indeed among  the simplest living forms it is often difficult to say  whether they are plants or animals  But it is impossible for us to follow out the  history of both these great branches or Kingdoms  as naturalists call them so we must reluctantly turn  our backs for the present upon the wonderful secrets  of plant life and give ourselves up in this work to  the study of animals  First we meet with those simple forms which  manage so cleverly to live without any separate  parts with which to do their work Marvellous  little beings these which live and move and  multiply in a way quite incomprehensible as yet to  us Next we pass on to the slightly higher forms  of the second division of life in which the members  have some simple weapons of attack and defence  Here we come first upon the wonderful living sponge  building its numerous canals which are swept by  special scavengers these form a sort of separate  group hovering between the first and second division  and from them we go on to the travelling jellyfish  with their rudiments of eyes and ears and their  benumbing sting and then to the seaanemones with  their lassocells and to the wondrous coralbuilders  Already we are beginning to find that the need of  defence causes life to arm her children  The third division is a small yet most curious one  containing the starfish with their countless suckerfeet  the seaurchins with their delicate sharp spines and  curious teeth and the sea cucumbers with their  power of throwing away the inside of their body  and growing it afresh This division goes off in  one direction while the next or fourth though start  ing with creatures almost as simple as the coral  builders takes quite a different line having for its  members mussels and snails cuttlefish and oysters  and dividing into two curious groups the one of  the shellfish with heads and the other of those  without any  The fifth division starting also in its own line by  the side of the third and fourth includes the creeping  worms provided with quite a different set of weapons  and working in their own peculiar fashion some living  in the water some on the earth and some in the flesh  of other beings feeding upon their living tissues An  ugly division this and yet when we come to study it  we shall find it full of curious forms showing strange  habits and ways  The sixth division is a vast army in itself with  four chief groups all agreeing in their members  having jointed feet and subdivided into smaller  groups almost without number The first group  including the crabs and their companions live in the  water and their weapons are so varied and numerous  that it will be difficult for us even to gain some  general idea of them The other three groups the  centipedes spiders and six legged insects breathe  only in the air This sixth or jointedlegged division  contains more than four fifths of the whole of the  living beings on our globe and it forms a world  of its own full of interest and wonders In it we  have all the strange facts of metamorphosis the  wondrous contrivances and constructions of insect  life and at the head of it those clever societies of  wasps bees and ants with laws sometimes even  nearer to perfection than those of man himself  Lastly we come to the seventh and vast division  of backboned animals which will claim a separate  volume to itself This division has struggled side  by side with the other six till it has won a position  in many respects above them all Nearly all the  animals which we know best belong to it the fishes  toads and newts amphibia the reptiles the birds  and the mammalia including all our fourfooted  animals as well as the whales seals monkeys and  man himself  Under these seven divisions then are grouped the  whole of the living animals as they are spread over  the earth to fight the battle of life Though in many  places the battle is fierce and each one must fight  remorselessly for himself and his little ones yet the  struggle consists chiefly in all the members of the  various brigades doing their work in life to the best  of their power so that all while they live may lead  a healthy active existence  The little bird is fighting his battle when he  builds his nest and seeks food for his mate and his  little ones and though in doing this he must kill the  worm and may perhaps by and by fall a victim  himself to the hungry hawk yet the worm heeds  nothing of its danger till its life comes to an end  and the bird trills his merry song after his break  fast and enjoys his life without thinking of perils  to come   While ravening death of slaughter neer grows weary  Life multiplies the immortal meal as fast  All are devourers all in turn devoured  Yet every unit in the uncounted sum  Of victims has its share of bliss its pang  And but a pang of dissolution each  Is happy till its moment comes and then  Its first last suffering unforeseen unfeard  Ends with one struggle pain and life for ever  So life sends her children forth and it remains  for us to learn something of their history If we  could but know it all and the thousands of different  ways in which the beings around us struggle and  live we should be overwhelmed with wonder Even  as it is we may perhaps hope to gain such a glimpse  of the labours of this great multitude as may lead us  to wish to fight our own battle bravely and to work  and strive and bear patiently if only that we may  be worthy to stand at the head of the vast family of  Lifes children  CHAPTER II  LIFES SIMPLEST CHILDREN HOW THEY LIVE AND  MOVE AND BUILD   The very meanest things are made supreme  With innate ecstasy No grain of sand  But moves a bright and millionpeopled land  And hath its Edens and its Eves I deem  For love though blind himself a curious eye  Hath lent me to behold the heart of things  And touched mine ear with power Thus far or nigh  Minute or mighty fixed or free with wings  Delight from many a nameless covert sly  Peeps sparkling and in tones familiar sings  LAMAN BLANCHARD  HO are Lifes simplest children  and where are they to be found  Let us try to answer the second  question first and rubbing the  scales from off our eyes peer into  the hidden secrets of nature and  when we have tracked to their  home the tiny beginnings of life  we will examine them and try to  understand how they live  How calm and lovely and  still the sea looks on a warm  sunny breezeless day of summer  and how happy we can imagine  the myriads of creatures to be  that float in its waters We know many of them  well especially those which come close up to the  shore The small fry of the fish the shrimp arid the  sandhopper the large jellyfish and the tiny trans  parent jellybells see 3 Fig 2 2 only to be seen by the  keenest eye as we dip out the water carefully in a  glass Surely these minute jellybells with their in  visible hanging threads must be some of the simplest  and lowest forms of life Not so they are really  very high up in the world compared with the forms  we are seeking  If indeed we come out late some autumn evening  when after the sun has set and the sky is dark the  sea in some sheltered bay appears all covered with  a sheet of light we may see some of the beings  of the lowest order of life with the naked eye for  when we dip the liquid fire out in a glass vessel and  examine it we find in it hundreds and thousands of  tiny bags of slime giving out the bright specks of  light and these little Noctilucae or nightglows 2  Fig 3 are as we shall presently see some of Lifes  simplest children although not by any means the  most simple of the order  No to begin at the very beginning and find the  first known attempts at a living being we must  search long and carefully not merely with our  own eyes but with the microscope Then we may  perhaps be fortunate enough to discover some won  drously small creature like that on the next page  which Professor Haeckel took out of the sunny blue  waters of the Mediterranean near Nice in 1864  The largest specimen to be found will be smaller  than the smallest pins head yet when seen under  the microscope this tiny speck appears with out  stretched threads a living animal see tfFig i floating  in search of food Examine it how we will we can  find in it no mouth no stomach no muscles no  nerves no parts of any kind It looks merely like  The Threadslime Haeckel  a In its natural round shape immensely magnified b spreading itself  over a small animal c Ceratium to suck the soft body out of the shell  a minute drop of gum with fine grains in it floating  in the water sometimes with its fine threads out  stretched sometimes as a mere drop and if we take  it out and analyse the matter of which it is made  we find that is much the same as a speck of white  ofegg Is it possible that it can be alive How can  we be sure In the first place it breathes If it be  kept in a drop of water it uses up the oxygen in  it and makes the water bad by breathing into it  carbonic acid then it moves and as we shall see  presently can draw in and throw out its fine threads  when and where it chooses again it eats feeding on  the minute jelly plants in the water or even on  animals higher in the world than itself and lastly it  grows and increases for when it is too large to be  comfortable it splits in two and each half goes its  way as a living animal  Let us see how one behaved which Professor  Haeckel took out of the sea and kept in a watch  glass under a microscope When he first looked at  it he found that it was drawn up in a lump with a  minute animal and a plantcell in the middle of its  slime and close by it in the water lay a small living  animal called a Ceratium c Fig i which has a  hard case or shell After a while as he watched  he saw the threadslime put out its fine threads on  all sides a Fig i Soon the threads on the right  side touched the shell of the Ceratium Here was  food and the body of the Threadslime evidently  became aware of it at once for all the little grains in  the slime began to course to and fro and the threads  touching the Ceratium lengthened out and stretched  more and more over it while all those on the other  side which had not found any food were drawn in  b Fig i Six hours later when Dr Haeckel looked  again to his astonishment the thread slime had  disappeared but on examining more closely he  discovered it completely spread in patches over the  shell of the Ceratium It had drawn its whole body  after the pioneering threads and wrapped itself round  its prey Next morning when he looked again lo  it was back in its original place and by its side lay  the Ceratium shell quite empty together with the  skeletons of the other two forms which had been  inside the Threadslime  This little drop of slime without eyes or ears or  parts of any kind knew how to find its food without  muscles or limbs it was able to creep over it without  a mouth it could suck out its living body without a  stomach it could digest the food in the midst of its  own slime and throw out the hard parts which it  did not want  This is the history of one of Lifes simplest  children  Here is another Fig 2 which lives not only in the  sea but also in pools and puddles and in the gutters  of our streets and of  our housetops Any  where that water lies  stagnant these little  drops of slime will grow  up and make it their  home Sometimes few  and far between some  times in crowds so that  The Finger SVaoRHaeekd the whole pond would  a At rest b Feeding on minute seem a lj ve jf we CQU d  slimeplants  see them they live and  multiply and die under our very feet Can any  thing be less like an animal than this shapeless  mass a Fig 2 Yet under a strong microscope it  may be seen moving lazily along by putting out a  thick slimy finger and then letting all the rest of its  body flow after it When it touches food it flows  over it just as the Threadslime did and dissolving  the soft parts sends out the hard refuse anywhere it  does not matter where for it has no skin over its  body being merely one general mass of slime  And now before we go on to other forms let me  ask you to pause and think what these little slime  specks tell us about the wonderful powers of Life  Can you guess at all how these creatures do their  work We are obliged to have eyes to see our food  nerves and muscles to enable us to feel and grasp it  mouths to eat it stomachs which secrete a juice in  order to dissolve it and a special pump the heart to  drive it into the different parts of our body But in  these tiny slimeanimals life has nothing better to  work with than a mere drop of living matter which  is all alike throughout so that if you broke it into  twenty pieces every piece would be as much a living  being as the whole drop And yet by means of the  wonderful gift of life this slime drop lives and  breathes and eats and increases shrinks away if you  touch it feels for its food and moves from place to  place changing its shape to form limbs and feeling  threads which are lost again as soon as it no longer  needs them  Nor have we yet learnt onehalf of the marvels  which can be wrought in living specks of slime For  on further inquiry we find these simple forms de  veloping two quite different modes of life In the  one case the slime is moulded itself into delicate  forms making creatures with mouths with suckers  and with delicate lashes to drive the body through  the water while in the other case remaining a simple  drop with delicate threads it has learned to build a  solid covering of the most exquisite delicacy  To the first class belongs our little Noctiluca and  the forms drawn by its side in Fig 3 To the second  belong the microscopic shells Fig 4 which form our  chalk Look at the little wriggling creatures at I  Fig 3 small as they look here they are drawn many  thousand times larger than they really are in life  and yet they are much more perfectly formed than  either the thread slime or the fingerslime They  have actually a kind of skin and do not throw out  threads here and there but are provided with a little  whip of slime which they lash to and fro and so drive  themselves through the water These microscopic  forms called monads grow up in water in which flowers  have stood for many days till their stalks begin to de  cay and in infusions of hay or straw made by pouring  hot water upon them and letting it stand and for  this reason the little beings are called infusoria In  such impure water under a powerful microscope you  may see them darting along by thousands But the  whip does not only serve them as an oar it also sends  the food they meet with into a tiny opening one of  lifes first attempts at a mouth With a little jerk  when the creature is still or fixed to the bottom the  whip drives still smaller beings than the monad itself  into its wideopened cavity and there they are digested  in a little watery bubble which may be clearly seen  in its body The Noctiluca or nightglow 2 Fig 3  s much larger being often as large as the head of  a small pin and just below the outer rim of its slimy  bag the sparks of light are given out It has been  reckoned that there are as many as 30000 Noc  tilucae in one cubic inch of phosphorescent water  and it is almost impossible to grasp the idea of the  millions upon millions of these tiny forms which  must be floating over a sea which is giving out a  glow of liquid fire for miles and miles And it is only  because of this light that we realise that they are there  There are just as many other forms in the water on  every side of us while we dream nothing of this  teeming life in the midst of which we live  We cannot stop here to speak of the tubesucker  and all his relations which have a mouth at the end  of every tube nor of the beautiful little bellflower ft  which may be seen in any pond or in seawater with  its hanging bells whirling the food in by their little  fringe of hairs a Fig 3 or shutting up with the  food inside and starting back by curling up their  slender stem b or splitting in two c and sending  off buds d d which swim away to form new colonies  elsewhere All these wondrous little beings are some  of lifes simplest children and one and all are made  of nothing but slime while yet they live and move  and seek their daily food  But all these are naked and homeless and to a  great extent unprotected Gulped down in thou  sands and millions by each other and by other  animals they are defenceless and weak against  attacks It would certainly be better for them  if they could have solid shells to cover their soft  bodies and to protect them in many dangers And  so we find that even in this lowest stage of life  necessity is the mother of invention and drops of  slime no higher than the threadslime Fig i have  learned to build shells around their delicate bodies  These shellbuilders live chiefly in the sea and  there you may find them if you search carefully by  the help of a strong magnifying glass in the ooze of  oysterbeds or under the leaves of the delicate green  seaweed or in the muddy sand of the seashore  The most common forms will be those shown at a e   and g in Fig 4 and though they are so very  small you may if you are fortunate see them clinging  by their fine slimethreads to the weeds or the mud  These animals are as I have said simple slime  drops like the threadslime but they add to the list of  wonderful things that such slime can do for they take  out of the seawater particle by particle the lime  which is dissolved in it and build around their soft  bodies the solid shell or skeleton in which they live  Nor is this all even if they all built the same simple  shell it would be very puzzling to imagine how they  do it bul they do much more They build shells in  many different shapes often with the most beautiful  and complicated patterns upon them All but the  simplest shells have several chambers in them a new  one being added as soon as the animal outgrows the  last one and in the partition between each chamber  there is a minute hole through which a thin thread of  slime passes into the next chamber so that the whole  body is joined together throughout the shell On  account of these holes these limebuilders have been  called Foraminifera from foramen a hole fero I bear   This name is now often defined as meaning that the outside of  the shell is perforated with holes but the earlier use of the word as  given here is more correct because it applies equally to the perforated  and nonperforated Foraminifera  Let us now take one of these shells a Fig 4 and  see how it was built up The grown animal as he  looks when the shell is taken off him is shown in  Fig 5 In the beginning when he is quite young he  F is merely a round drop i Fig 5 with  a delicate transparent shell and an  opening out of which he puts his  threads of slime Then as he out  grows this first chamber he draws  his slime threads together and forms  a bud 2 outside the shell and  round this bud he builds a second  The jelly body of r  the Miliolite a Fig 4 chamber out of the end of which  showing the buds of he again puts his threads Then he  3 Uich 3 Sci fs the next bud 3 and goes  chamber is built on thus till he has built a com  Carpenter pj ete ell generally of seven cham  bers and as each new compartment is so placed  as to overlap the one before it the whole when  finished has the curious form a Fig 4 altogether  not larger than a millet seed from which it takes  the name of Miliola These miliolite shells may  be found by the help of the microscope in the  damp sand of almost any seashore and while some  of the shells will be empty others will still be filled  with the darkyellow animal slime  Think of the constant manufacture of such delicate  shells as these going on all over the world and the  makers but a drop of slime And lest you should  be inclined to think little of it as a mere mechanical  process the miliolite himself tells us another story for  from time to time we find miliolites with shells made  not of lime but of grains of sand and tiny broken  pieces of shell a Fig 4 which the little architect  has used to build the walls of his house when for  some reason the ordinary material was deficient It  seems to me that the power of this living drop to  choose its own materials is one of the most wonderful  facts in the history of lifes simplest children  These miliolites and other Foraminifera when  found clinging to seaweed are easily placed in a salt  water aquarium and they will then thrust their  threads out of the mouth of the shell and crawl on  the sides of the glass Professor Schultze even saw  a number of young miliolites born in an aquarium  and this was how it happened He noticed one day  that several of his miliolites had covered the outside  of their shells with their brown slimy body and a  few days later he could see through the microscope  a number of darklooking specks gradually loosening  themselves from this slime  There were as many as forty of these specks on  one shell and after a time he could distinguish that  every speck was a tiny miliolite having only one  chamber i Fig 5 to begin life in the shell of  which was so pale and transparent that he could  see the slime within it As soon as each one  shook himself free from the rest of the slime he  put out his threads and crawled away on the glass  to get his own living and now when Professor  Schultze examined the shell of the parent miliolite  he found it almost empty The mother had broken  herself up into her little children  A miliolite builds generally only six or seven  chambers but other forms such as c Figure 4 build  hundreds of separate apartments This particular  form c which is called an Orbitolite has often as  many as fifteen rings each with its numerous  chambers even when the whole shell is only as  large as the head of a small pin and in ages long  gone by the larger Orbitolites had a far greater num  ber of rings and thousands of chambers in one single  shell The animal builds these in the same way as we  have seen the Miliolite do it only after he has made  one round of chambers with a hole in each he puts  out slimethreads at every hole and joins them into a  ring with swellings in it like beads upon a string and  round these he builds the next row of chambers So  he goes on increasing his home till he reaches his full  size and then Professor Parker tells us that the slime  of the outer row often breaks up into myriads of young  Orbitolites just as the body of the Miliolite did At  the same time these forms can also multiply by merely  breaking in half as the naked Fingerslime does and if  by accident a piece of an Orbitolite is broken off it  can form a new and complete shell of its own  If you have now understood how the Orbitolite  grows you will see that the only communication it  has with the outer world is through the minute threads  which stretch out of the holes of the chambers in the  last ring see c Fig 4 and that the slime in all the  middle chambers can get food in no other way than  by its passing from the outside right through all the  other rings This is a tedious way of getting food  and we shall find that some of the forms shown in  Fig 4 have escaped from it in a most ingenious way  These forms d to h Fig 4 have hit upon the plan of  keeping their thin threads stretched out like the thread  slime a Fig i all the time they are laying down their  limehouse The consequence of this is that wherever  a thread has been there a minute hole like a pinprick  is left in the shell and while the animal can draw  itself quite in out of danger it can also come out all  over the shell and take in food Here then we have  another stratagem taught by life to these her infant  children The slime which builds the Globigerina a  or the Rotalia g is exactly the same as far as we  can see as the slime which builds the Miliolite and  yet those drops of slime have learnt a new lesson  and each one as it is born stretches out its fine threads  before constructing its shell thus providing a thou  sand openings for the entrance of its food in a house  not bigger than a grain of sand  And now it only remains for us to ask how long  these wondrous limebuilders have been upon the  earth We ask and ask in vain for we have no  means of counting the vast ages during which they  have lived and built One of the largest and most  complicated forms called the Numnmife from nummus  a coin which it resembles lived  and died in such millions before Fig 6  the Alps or the Carpathians had any  existence that whole beds of lime  stone thousands of feet thick and  stretching over hundreds of miles  are made entirely of its shells  while the little Globigerina d Fig  4 and its friends were living and A Nummulitewith  multiplying in still more dim and openowLgAe  distant periods till their shells accu chambers Life size  mulated into vast beds of chalk  When the ancient Egyptians raised the pyramids  of Egypt they little dreamed that every inch of the  stone they used was made of the shelly palaces of  the Nummulite constructed by little drops of slime  with a skill and ingenuity far surpassing their own  As little do most Parisians think now that the lime  stone of which their houses are built is almost entirely  made up of Orbitolite shells And still less does the  country boy as he strolls over the chalk downs of  Sussex or Hampshire suspect that the chalk under  his feet is largely composed of shells of the Globi  gerina and the other minute forms shown in Figure  4 yet so it is These minute slimebuilders have  been patiently living and building for untold ages  and are doing so still at the bottom of the Atlantic  where the Globigerina lives in such great numbers  that the falling of the shells through the water down  to the bottom must be like a constant shower of  snow as is proved by the freshness of those brought  up in the dredge  When a little of the chalky mud was taken up from  the bottom at the time when the Atlantic telegraph  was laid down it was found to be almost entirely com  posed of Globigerina shells and this led naturalists  who had long known that chalk was formed of shelly  matter to rub down some ordinary chalk and examine  it under the microscope and there again was our little  Globigerina often crushed and worn but still plainly  recognisable So that astounding as it may seem  it is nevertheless true that the vast beds of chalk  stretching from Ireland to the Crimea from Sweden  to Bordeaux are in great part formed of the dead  shells of these little drops of slime  We have paused so long over the limebuilders  that we can only glance at those minute specks of  slime which build their skeletons of flint instead of lime  These animals are  a little higher in  the world than the  lime builders for  their body has with  in it a small bag or  capsule buried in  the middle of the  slime see Fig 7  and in this bag  the solid grains lie  very thickly and  have sometimes  small crystals a  mong them while  in the slime round  it there are often  little oil globules floating If you dip a glass  into the quiet bays of Nice or Messina you may be  fortunate enough to bring up one or more of these  little sunslimes but they are so tiny and transparent  that even when the light falls upon them you will  only distinguish them as bright specks in the water  Their threads stick out stiff and straight and for this  reason they are all classed under the name Radiolaria  or raylike animals  Let us look for a moment at Fig 8 and study the  solid skeletons which these Radiolaria build with the  flint or silex which they find in minute quantities in  the water We saw that the limebuilders construct  The SunSlime Haeckel  Immensely magnified its real size being not  larger than a mustard seed  shells into ivhich they can draw back entirely if they  are attacked but the flintbuilders seem very careless  in this respect for they have large holes all over their  flinty skeletons But then on the other hand notice  how they send out sharp spikes which must be un  comfortable for any animal trying to snap at them  although as we have seen p 16 the soft thread  slime manages to suck their bodies out of the shells  Still these hard spiky outside skeletons must be a  great protection to them and we find every kind of  shape devised by these wonderful architects in the  construction of their tiny houses though these are so  small as to look like a grain of sand when seen by  the naked eye Perhaps the most wonderful of all is  the one shown at Fig 8 It is broken open to show  the three balls one within another each kept in its  place by rods of flint passing through the whole  This beautiful little shell looks just like the carved  balls of the Chinese yet instead of being the work of  intelligent man it is built by a mere mass of slime  We have now learned to know the simplest of all  animals how they live and move and the homes  they build All the forms are not quite equally  simple for some of the higher ones have a solid  spot or nucleus in the middle of the slime and some  times a small wateiy bubble as in the Monad or the  Bellflower which contracts and expands at intervals  and in these forms the outside of the slime is rather  thicker than the inside so that we might say that  they are on the road to having a skin while the  shellbuilders have a uniform slimy body But both  classes alike belong to that first and lowest branch  of the children of life called by scientific men the  Protozoa protos first zoon animal or first animals  The still water everywhere is swarming with them  though we may see and know nothing of them Yet  we owe them something for not only do the dead  shells of many of them form our solid ground but  those now living purify our waters by feeding upon  the living and dead matter in them These tiny  slime animals are the invisible scavengers of the ocean  and the pools and in earning their own living they  also work for others When you look upon a still  pond in some quiet country lane the insects you see  swimming about in it and the plants which cover it  are not the only inhabitants but on its surface and in  its silent depths minute specks of slime are living and  working though no eye can see them Beautiful and  wonderful however as these forms are they are yet  very low in the scale of life they live and increase  in multitudes but in multitudes also they die and are  devoured Delicate and frail and helpless they are  as it were but first attempts at the results which  life can accomplish Let us pass on and see the  next step towards higher and in many ways more  ambitious creatures  CHAPTER III  HOW SPONGES LIVE  And here were coral bowers  And grots of madrepores  And banks of sponge as soft and fair to eye  As eer was mossy bed  Whereon the woodnymphs lie  With languid limbs in summers sultry hours  SOUTHEY  HERE are certainly very few  people from the little child in  the nursery to the artist in his  studio or from the lady in her bed  room to the groom in the stables  who do not handle a sponge almost  every day of their lives and yet pro  bably not one in a hundred of these  people has ever really looked at  the sponge he or she is using or  considered what a curious and beau  tiful thing it is  Yet there are at least two things  in even the commonest sponges  which ought at once to attract attention If you  take a piece of ordinary honeycomb sponge in  your hand and look at it you cannot help being  struck by the large holes few and far between upon  its surface and the numberless small holes scattered  about between them and on looking carefully down  one of the large holes you will see that it leads to a  long tube into which a number of small tubes open  while on the other hand if you try to follow out any  of the smaller holes in the same way you will find  that they soon come to an end and branch out side  ways into each other so as to form an irregular net  work of short tubes Lastly if you cut the sponge open  and follow out this network you will discover that  it always ends by leading sooner or later into one  of the large tubes What is the reason of this com  plicated arrangement of holes all opening into each  other and by whom has it been planned and carried  out  Again an examination of the material of the  sponge will show that it is not a mere structureless  mass but is made up of delicate silkfibres woven  Fig 9 together into a kind of fine fluffy  gauze By putting a thin slice of  the sponge under a microscope  it is possible to distinguish this  gossamer tissue very clearly and  to see that it is quite loosely  woven and that it is only because  the texture is so fine and the  A thin fragment of a la y erS fit SO cl Sel y ne ab VC  bathsponge seen under the other that when looked at  the microscope f rom aDO ve it appears a solid sub  stance There is scarcely a more curious object under  the microscope than a thin slice of fine sponge though  it is almost impossible in a picture to show its curious  nestlike appearance How has this web been woven so  delicately What architect has laid the fibres so  skilfully and formed such a wonderful and intricate  structure  The architect is one of Lifes children whose his  tory we must next consider for though the sponge  was long thought to be a plant we now know that  it is the skeleton or framework of a slime animal  a little higher than those spoken of in the last  chapter When the sponge which you hold in your  hand was alive growing on the rocks in the warm  deep waters of the Grecian Archipelago or the  Red Sea it did not consist merely of the soft fibre  you now see but was covered all over the outside  and lined throughout even along the smallest of its  tubes with a film of slime This slime though it  appears to be all one mass with specks of solid matter  here and there is really made up of Amoebae or finger  slime beings see Fig 2 and if any little piece is torn  off it floats in the water and puts out fingers exactly  as the Amoeba does Nevertheless in the sponge  all these separate cells are not independent creatures  but form the flesh of one single sponge animal  which lives breathes feeds grows and gives forth  young ones in its ocean home  At the bottom of the warm seas on the Mediter  ranean coast or in the Gulf of Mexico these sponge  animals live in wild profusion sometimes hiding in  submarine caverns sometimes standing boldly on the  top of a slab of rock or often hanging under ledges  Some are round like cups some branched like trees  some thin and spread out like a fan while there is  scarcely a colour from a brilliant orange to a dull  dingy brown which is not to be seen among them  The floor on which they grow is often as beautiful  as they are themselves with its covering of tangled  seaweeds among which live the many shelled  creatures of the sea while fish swim hither and  thither and the whole region is teeming with life   Of seaborn kinds ten thousand thousand tribes  Find endless range for pasture and for sport  Such is the Spongekingdom and the whole colony  of sponges of every shape and size flourish like  monarchs in their domain So long as they are  alive few can attack them and fewer conquer or  destroy them Only the spongefisher diving down  into the rich colony disturbs its peace and tearing  the living sponge ruthlessly from its rocky bed  wrings out the living slime and destroys the animal  for the sake of its skeleton  Every three years this destroyer visits the  spongecolony for he knows that in spite of his having  carried off all the best and richest specimens this  interval is enough for new spongeanimals to have  grown up so as to weave large and perfect skeletons  What secret then has Life taught to the sponge  animal that while it is still only slime it can grow  into such large masses and protect itself so well against  the other inhabitants of the sea We will answer  this question by tracing the growth of a sponge from  its birth and reading its history  If you wish to watch a living sponge yourself  you have only to keep one in a saltwater aquarium  for small sponges are easily found alive on our  English coast though they will not look like those  we use In this description however we will ima  gine that we can visit one of the sponge colonies  in the Mediterranean Sea  or the Gulf of Mexico  where the rocks from fifty  to a hundred and fifty feet  below the surface of the  clear blue water are covered  with sponges of every size  and shape and texture  If we could visit these  sponge beds during the  summer or autumn months  and examine carefully the  slimy lining of one of the  big tubes of a living  sponge we should find that  minute bags of slime  i a Fig 1 1 are begin  ning to appear in it either  scattered through the  sponge or collected in heaps  These are spongeeggs out  of which young sponges  are to grow and in many  ways they are very like a hens egg Within  as may be seen through their transparent cover  ing is something which answers to the yelk of  an egg with a solid spot or nucleus in it This  yelk begins soon to divide into two cells or separate  masses of slime and these again divide into four  these four into eight and so on till the egg is a  globe of small round cells the beginning of the  young sponge And now a change may be seen to  A British sponge found at  Brighton lifesize  take place in those cells which lie all round the  outside of the rest each one of them puts forth a  minute whiplike lash called a cilium from cilium  an eyelash so as to form a fringe round the whole  body and then the young sponge being ready to  make its own way in the world bursts through the  skin of the bag and wav  ing its lashes swims out  an oval shaped body 2  Fig 1 1 into the sea  Here you will notice  we have a body not   made as in the simplest  The birth of the Sponge Adapted  from Carter slimeanimals of a mere  1

like a colony of monads see Fig 3  surrounding the animal  By means of these it swims along and feeds and  as it grows a small nipple c afterwards to become a  hole appears at the tip while a group of larger cells d  collect at the hinder end By means of these cells  the little animal attaches itself to the spot where it is  to spend the rest of its life sometimes to a pebble but  generally to the solid rock Small sponges often fix  themselves to living shells and Dr Johnstone tells us  that he met with a sponge on the back of a crab  which walked about quite unconcerned with its light  burden though it was many times larger than itself  Having settled the young sponge now spreads  itself out upon the rock and grows and builds up its  fibrous skeleton while its surface becomes irregular  and full of large and small holes and the true sponge  appears  And now comes the curious part of the story  As the sponge grows larger it is clear that the cells  in the middle of its body must be more and more  Fig 12  Development of a young English sponge Adapted from Carter  3 The swimming sponge of Fig 1 1 which has now fixed itself 4  The same with water squirting from the hole now formed 5 The  same further developed 6 The perfect sponge with small holes  where the water enters and large holes out of which it is squirted  shut out from the surrounding water out of which  food can be taken and yet these cells want feeding  as much as those outside In order to bring this  about the spongeanimal instead of growing up as a  solid mass of slimecells arranges the silky fibres of  its skeleton in such a manner as to leave a number of  small canals or passages throughout its body and these  open as we have seen sooner or later into large canals  or main thoroughfares while the slimy spongebody is  spread out as a thin film along them all In this  way it is possible for the seawater to reach right  throughout the whole body of the sponge along the  various canals But if this water only lay still from  day to day no fresh food could be brought and the  whole vould become stagnant and bad The animal  cannot feed or even breathe unless a constant fresh  supply of water full of oxygen and living beings is  driven through the canals  How is this to be done  At first sight it seems as if the young sponge  were behaving very foolishly in this matter for no  sooner has it settled down than it draws in all the  whip like hairs outside its body which we should  have thought would be useful for driving in food and  becomes a mass of smooth slimecells with large and  small holes scattered here and there Still as the  water goes on pouring out at the big holes see Fig  1 2 it is clear that it must be going in somewhere and  on cutting open the living sponge and watching it  at work the secret appears Here and there through  out the narrow canals of the skeleton are to be found  little chambers like two saucers face to face iFig I 3  and in these are arranged in rows a number of whip  like cells exactly like those which were before outside  the sponge It is the whips in these cells which do  the work required Waving ceaselessly to and fro  they drive the water before them always in one direc  tion so that it is drawn in at the small holes a a  Fig i 3 and driven out at the large ones b ti By  means of this wonderful contrivance fresh seawater  full of oxygen and living plants and animals is  always pouring along the small canals bringing air  and food to each cell along the road while the bad  water out of which the slime has taken all the oxy  gen and into w r hich it has thrown the hard parts and  refuse of its food is driven out at the large holes  carrying away with it all that is hurtful and useless  And now we can understand why the sponge  though a mere slimeanimal is classed as the pioneer  of the second division of living animals because in it  quite a new plan of structure has begun Starting from  one eggthe whole sponge is one single individual yet  when grown up it is not a mere mass all doing the same  work as in the simplest animals for it has learnt the  secret of division of labour and while one set of cells  those forming the smooth slime are busy taking in  food the other and whiplike cells are foraging for this  same food and sweeping away the refuse and be  tween these two a special layer of smooth cells is  employed in building up the skeleton which supports  the whole body  If we knew only the grownup sponge we might  look upon it as a society of two kinds of slime  animals living together and building a common house  But when we consider that each whole sponge comes  from a single egg growing and dividing like one of  the eggs of the higher animals and that any piece  of a spongeanimal is able to settle and grow up  into a perfect sponge with the two kinds of cells we  see that these animals have made a great step never  again to be forgotten by the children of Life They  have learned to form in one body two kinds of cells  with different duties which by their mutual labour  carry on in one being the work of life  We are now I hope able to picture to ourselves  the sponge growing upon the rocks in deep water or  sometimes in shallow pools or between the tide  marks looking like a smooth mass of slime of  different shapes with holes invariably open as long  as it is under water but closed as we shall find on  the English shores if the sponge is by chance left  high and dry by the tide We can imagine to our  selves the small fountains of water spouting from  the larger openings and carrying off the refuse from  the inside of the sponge and we can fancy we see  the small chambers buried in the canals with their  active inmates lashing the water onwards in its course  through the whole mass  But we have yet to consider the skeleton of the  living animal and why so much time and labour  should be spent in forming it There are two  reasons why a solid framework is useful to the  spongeanimal First it supports the large mass of  soft slime and enables it to spread itself out in thin  layers so as to touch the water in the canals and  secondly it protects it from enemies  There are a few sponges made entirely of slime  the canals and thoroughfares being in the slime itself  and in these when the animal dies and decaysnothing  solid is left behind But such sponges have probably  become degraded and have lost their skeleton and they  are clearly under a disadvantage for the walls of slime  are forced to be much thicker and food cannot reach  them so easily and besides this when we remember  how many seaanimals feed on living slime we can  not but see that these sponges offer a very tempting  feast Comparatively large animals such as shrimps  and fish will take big mouthfuls out of them while the  waterfleas and smaller seaworms which are carried  through their canals are quite as ready to eat the  slime as the slime is to eat them But if the sponge  can offer a very tough and unpalatable mouthful or  can prick its enemies mouths with a sharp point  they will not be so ready to take a second bite and  so it comes to pass that we find in sponges some of  the most curious weapons imaginable  The sponges we use are by no means the first  attempts at spongeskeletons on the contrary they  represent the highest art in spongebuilding The  simplest kind of sponges build their skeletons of  lime and flint as did the earlier slimeanimals Fig  14 is a picture of a lime sponge Here the outer  layer of sponge flesh has taken in lime and built  up with it a number of little pointed spikes or  spicules which lie buried in the  slime The rest of the sponge is  composed entirely of the sponge  animal the outer cells being smooth  and the inner ones whiplike so  that water and fojod are drawn in  at the small holes in the sides  while the refuse is driven out at the  large hole in the top  Now suppose that a fish attacks  this sponge instead of a mouthful   of soft slime he will bite upon a  number of minute sharp points   which he will carry away sticking  to the soft lining of his mouth  and the next time he sees such a  sponge growing he will hesitate  before touching it In some  Sponge with lime sponges these limethorns are so  spicules forming the arranged that they lie flat against  a complete hedge of spikes round  the holes when it is taking in water showing that it is  not only against the fish that it is protecting itself  but against the smaller but dangerous animals which  might be washed into it In another sponge the spic  ules point towards the mouth at the top so that any  creature which has got in can be easily thrown out  but one trying to get in would be spiked directly  Lime sponges  are to be found in  most parts of the  world and some of  them are very beau  tiful from the ar  rangement of their  spicules But these  look after all like  mere rough attempts  at spike building  when compared with  the wonderful spic  ules which are made  by the flint build Spicules of flint found in the flesh of  ing sponges flint sponges Real size a mere speck  Fig I5 shows almost invislble to the naked e y e  only a very few of the forms of flint spicules which  are known They look under the microscope as  if the sponge animal were an artist trying how  many curious patterns he could invent and yet  Dr Bowcrbank has shown that each of these  shapes has some special use either in keeping out  enemies in supporting the sponge or in spiking and  entangling the smaller animals which form the food  of the spongeanimal Often as many as from three  to seven different shapes may be found in one single  sponge forming by their combinations intricate and  beautiful patterns Yet each one of these spicules  perfect and complete in form as it is is so small as  to be barely visible as a speck to the naked eye and  so transparent that when mounted on glass for the  microscope it is impossible to detect even a group of  them without a lens  In Fig 1 6 may be seen three kinds in their natural  position in the flesh of the sponge the large ones  binding the sponge together and the small feathery  and anchorshaped spicules protecting the flesh and  jr ig j6 small as these last appear  yet they are even now  magnified 100 times  Lastly in the higher flint  buildingspongesthe archi  tect gets

that the flintlace of which it is made  has been constructed by an animal with no eyes to see  the beautiful pattern it was weaving and no machinery  in its body with which to direct the web and that out of  mere slime cells has arisen a fairy structure such as the  most skilled human artist might try in vain to rival  These sponges live chiefly in very deep water In one  of them called the glassrope sponge the animal is  anchored to the bottom by long flint threads often  several feet long looking like the finest spun glass  And now we find the  spongeanimal advancing  yet a step farther and  beginning no longer to  build entirely with lime  and flint taken from the  water but to manufacture  its own material We all  know that the spider spins  its web of threads of  gum formed in its body  and that the silk of the  silkworm is made in the  same manner and now we  have to learn that the  sponge animal with its  simple slime cells can do  this too For all the  sponges which we use are  made of fine fibres which  prove when examined to  differ very little chemically  from the silk of the silk  worm These fibres have  been secreted by the slime  animal out of its food and  by crossing and recross   y Venus Basket The skeleton of a  ing them in all directions flintsponge  it forms the soft elastic  skeleton of the toilet sponge Yet they are not woven  carelessly or without purpose for we have seen that they  are so arranged as to build up the small canals and  the large tubes in their right positions and though all  may look confused to us yet there is no part which the  water cannot reach in its passage through the sponge  At first in the coarser sponges the fibre is thick  and loosely woven and though it is toughand almost  impossible to bite or  digest yet it leaves  such large openings as  to afford but a poor  protection In these  sponges flint spicules  are still built in with  the fibrescattered about  in all directions and  because of the sharp  ness of the spicules  their skeletons are of  very little use to us  But little by little in  sponges of a finer web  in which the tough silky  Cupsponge growing in the sea Real cu v 1  size about a foot high Fignicr fibres are so ctosely  matted together as to  repel all intruders we find the spongeanimal begin  ning to neglect the formation of spicules and content  ing itself with building in fragments of sand making  those gritty sponges so disagreeable to handle And  by and by it ceases even to do this and in the fine  soft Turkey sponge we find the holes so small that  no enemy large enough to do harm could enter while  the densely woven fibres offer a most unpalatable and  indigestible morsel to any creature which might have  the strength to tear it away and these needing no  further protection are made entirely of soft fibre  Here we must leave the history of sponges and  their lives We have left much unsaid for to tell  how sponges may increase by dividing or by budding  as well as by eggs would have taken us too far into  detail neither could we give space to trace the  wonderful way in which the various spicules are used  as weapons of defence and for special examples of  the different kinds of sponges you must consult works  on natural history We have had one chief object in  view namely to see how Life in this new form has  advanced beyond the earliest slime animals The  sponge with its two forms of cells and its division of  labour stands already far above the microscopic  beings of our last chapter Rooted to the rocks and  large enough to invite the attacks of enemies it has  yet learnt to protect itself by wonderful structures  to distribute its food throughout a large body and  last but not least no longer to form its skeleton  merely f flint or lime but to manufacture in its own  body the material with which it builds  It has indeed succeeded so well that Dr Bower  bank one of the best authorities on sponge life came  to the conclusion that sponges are able to escape  almost entirely during their lifetime from becoming  the food of other animals It is only after their  death that their slime serves to nourish myriads of  minute creatures and then the wonderful rapidity  with which the living matter is devoured is quite  enough to prove to us how well the living sponge  must have used its weapons to protect itself while  still it was one of Lifes living children  CHAPTER IV  THE LASSOTHROWERS OF THE PONDS AND OCEANS   Transparent forms too fine for mortal sight  Their fluid bodies half

rearing  A new creation in the secret deep  MONTGOMERY   F among all the children of  life we wished to choose out  the most brilliant graceful and  sylphlike creatures whose histories  are more like fairy poems than  sober reality we could scarcely do  better than select those which we  are now going to study under the  name of the lassothrowers and  strange as this name may appear  I hope to show that it is not too  fanciful to be accurate  Every one knows that the long  cord or thong called the lasso is  the peculiar weapon of the South  From his earliest childhood the  American hunter  THE LA SSO THRO WERS  young Gaucho learns to play with the lasso and  almost as soon as he can walk amuses himself by  catching young birds and other animals round his  fathers hut throwing out the long lash so skilfully  that the noose falls over their bodies and brings them  to his feet As soon as he can ride he carries the  sport farther galloping wildly over the plains swing  ing the cord round his head and letting fly at the  ostriches the wild cattle and horses or when he is  a man even at the jaguar or the puma Such is the  lasso as man uses it consisting of a long cord or  thong thrown with exquisite skill  Now among animals as we have already seen any  weapons they are to Fi  use must be such as i 2  grow upon the body  and we should little  suspect that a simple  jellyanimal could be  provided with a lasso  ready grown within  its flesh Yet so it  is In that division  of lifes children  standing in rank just  above the sponges The freshwater hydra hanging from duck  we find a weapon of weed in a pond  i i i I The longarmed hydra feeding aw  this kind as simple small animals caught in its arms 2 Short  as deadly and far armed hydrat throwing off young hydra  more wonderful in buds b b  its action than the lasso of the American hunter  In almost any wayside pond in England it is pos  sible to find either hanging from under the leaves  of the common duckweed or clinging to pieces of  floating stick or rooted to stones at the bottom  of the pond a little greenish being Fig 19 about  a quarter of an inch long looking like a tube with a  circlet of feelers at the end which are waving in the  water This creature is the common pond hydra and  it is in fact nothing more than a tube or sac with a  sucker at one end to hold on with and a number of  jellyarms or tentacles at the other which serve to  catch its food and to tuck it into the sac where it  is digested The walls of the sac are firm and mus  cular and the creature can stretch itself out or draw  back at will can move along slowly by means of its  sucker and even float upon the water but the most  remarkable thing about it and the one we wish to  study now is the power which it has of overcoming  animals stronger and more active than itself  Groping about with its flexible arms which are  covered with fine jelly hairs by which it seems to  feel it touches perhaps a water flea a water worm  or even a tiny newly born fish passing by in the  water Instantly it twists its arms round whatever  it finds and though its prey may struggle vigorously  while the hydra remains almost still yet little by  little the struggles cease and the victim is drawn  into the fatal sac  Now why is this It is because those fine  tender feelers of the hydra are full of lassos which  it can use with as good effect as any skilled hunter  Although to the naked eye each tentacle looks but  little more than a fine hair yet when examined  under a strong microscope it is seen to be crowded  with hundreds of clear transparent cells l Fig 20  so small that 200 of the largest of them would lie  side by side in an inch while many are not more  than xsVftth of an inch long and each of these  cells contains a formidable weapon Within the cell  lying bathed in a poisonous fluid is coiled a long  delicate thread barbed at the base 2 3 Fig 20  and this thread  may well be call  ed a lasso since  it is always many  and often from  twenty to forty  times as long as  the cell itself and  only waits for the  bag to burst to  fling itself out to Piece of one of the hydra s arms showing  its full length the cells crowded in it 2 One of the cells  Now lookup 3 The same cell after bursting open 4 Lasso  cell of an anemone  at the hydra Fig  19 picture to yourself that each of its delicate  threadlike tentacles is crowded with hundreds of  these lassocells only waiting the word of command  to discharge their weapons By and by the two  worms a a come within reach and rub against the  tentacles instantly every cell that is touched bursts  open and with a spring its lasso is set free and  shoots out piercing through the skin of the worm  And now we can see where the hydras strength  lies He has no need to struggle for his victim is  pierced by a number of darts and the poisonous fluid  from the cells is pouring into him And there is  great reason why the hydra should take it so quietly  he does not wish to waste his lassos for a cell once  burst cannot be used again and he will have to  grow a new one for each one that he exhausts So  he waits patiently for the spell to work and does  not hug his victim too close until he is half conquered  and then he draws him gently in  So the hydra lives and catches its food without  needing to move far from the place of its birth All  the summer through it puts out buds see b b Fig  19 from its side and these buds as soon as their  tentacles are grown drop from their parent and settle  in life for themselves so that any pond may contain  hundreds of them and when the winter comes and  before they all die an egg appears near the base of  the tubes of those which are then living and these  eggs lie till next spring when they are hatched and  produce a new generation of hydras  This is the simplest lassothrower and I think  you will allow that his lasso is both wonderful and  deadly so that though these hydras are the only  lassothrowers to be found in fresh water it is easy  to understand that his relations in the wide ocean  should have made good use of the new weapon with  which life has provided them and secured homes and  restingplaces throughout the whole world of waters  and under all kinds of strange shapes and forms  From the North Sea to the Tropics from the  pools on the shore at low tide to the depths of the  wide ocean we meet everywhere with this division of   lassothrowers Now in the shape of large jellyfish  covering the sea for miles and miles so that a ship  may sail through them during many days the sailors  watching their transparent domes by day and being  illuminated by the light of their phosphorescence by  night Now as tiny jellybells floating like glistening  specks by millions in some quiet bay and breaking into  light as they are dashed upon the beach Or again  in the form of horny animaltrees often two or three  feet in height waving their gracefully arched branches  over the rocks in the deep water or creeping like  delicate threads over shells and stones and seaweed on  the shore where they are often mistaken for plants  There is scarcely a nook or cranny in the bed of  the ocean where some of these tree like forms are  not to be found associated with the beautiful sea  anemones with their brilliant colours of emerald  green crimson glowing purple and vivid orange  which belong to this same division as does also the  living coral nestling in the bosom of the warm Medi  terranean Sea or struggling boldly against the waves  of the Pacific as branch after branch is added to its  stem by the constant labours of the tiny jellypolyps  spreading their gaily coloured tentacles out of every  cup of the coral tree  All these beautiful creatures are lassothrowers  Scientific men call them Ccelenterata or hollowbodied  animals because of the large cavity within their  bodies and divide them into Hydrosoa water  animals and Actinozca raylike animals such as  the anemone but for us it is sufficient to know that  with very few exceptions they all seize their prey by  means of the lasso and we can pass on to learn  something of how they pass their lives  It is scarcely possible to collect seaweed on any  coast without finding upon it what look like minute  plants Fig 2 I with frequent joints Some of these  which are formed of chalk are true plants but others  which are yellowish and horny are no less certainly  animals and you may soon detect these by means of  a magnifying glass for they will bear at each joint  a little cup c c and if you could watch these cups  I The animaltree growing of the natural size 2 A piece of one  branch enlarged showing the animal b stretching out of the horny cup  c and one of the eggsacs s  when the creature is alive you would see out of each  one from 12 to 1 6 transparent tentacles b fr sweep  ing round in search of food  This treelike stem is in fact the home of a hydra  of the sea The creature itself is like the pond hydra  only that its buds do not fall off but continue to live  all together each enclosed in a cup made of a pecu  liar substance called chitin which is nearly allied to  horn and which also forms the skin of insects The  whole stem is only one individual for a fine living  thread passes down through the bottom of each cup  and meets all the others within the stem so that the  food digested in each tiny stomach goes to feed the  whole animal  Here then we have hundreds of tiny lassothrowers  acting as mouths and stomachs to one Sertularia as  this specimen is called Each mouth or polypite is  so small as scarcely to be seen even as a speck by  the naked eye yet it has sixteen tiny arms and each  arm is crowded with lassocells  And now in the summer months between May  and September small round bags S 2 Fig 2 i appear  scattered along the branches of this animaltree and  each one of these is full of eggs and by and by when  the eggs are hatched young sertularians swim out as  little round jelly bodies and settling down on some  stone or seaweed grow up into new stems of lasso  throwers  It is scarcely possible to conceive the number of  minute beings which are feeding in this way at the  bottom of the sea This particular sertularia or sea  oak coralline Fig 21 covers the seaweed of our  coasts with miniature animal forests and yet it is  one of the smaller kinds sometimes not more than  halfaninch high Others grow on shells forming a  fleecy covering which looks only like a little white  moss but which is really a group of living animals  Every child must be familiar with a kind of rough  crust frequently to be seen outside old shells but pro  bably few have ever thought that this is often the  remains of the home of a lasso thrower any more  than they would connect the tubelike branches on  the seaweed with a living animal  Try for one moment to picture to yourself some  quiet spot in the oceanbed where the whole floor is  carpeted with such forms and every shell and sea  weed carries some hundreds of tiny beings all  stretching out their waving tentacles and flinging out  their miniature lassos to strike their prey You would  see here and there among them tall graceful animal  trees such as the seafir which often grows up into  a brown upright tree more than three feet high with  branches bearing as many as a hundred thousand  cups each with its pure white polypite stretching out  and looking wonderfully delicate against the dark  stem while side by side with it may be standing  the tubehydraf which has single yellow pipes  out of each of which a brilliant scarlet creature is  waving its graceful tentacles All this life is active  and busy and yet it is all made up of beings so  insignificant to us that we have hardly any idea of  their existence  And while you were watching these thousands of  tiny arms you might perhaps witness a strange sight  if your eyes were sharp enough to see it From  an animal tree very like the sertularia i Fig 22  except that its horny cups are borne upon stalks  you might see escaping some little beings looking  like green shining bubbles and these if seen under  the microscope turn out to be the most beautiful  fairy jellybells 3 Fig 22 like pure crystal domes  swimming gaily along in the water by driving in and  out the jelly veil v 3 spread across their rim  Anything to exceed the delicacy and beauty of  these tiny jelly globes can scarcely be imagined and  1 Natural size of the animal tree s Natural size of the sac con  taining the jellybell 3 Natural

microscope all the different parts of the body as  shown at 3 Fig 22 can be clearly made out For  this bell is a true and delicately organised living  being It is a new instrument which Life has  invented for carrying the eggs of the animal  tree far away over the sea While the mouths  a a are busily catching food for the whole animal  by their lassos there has been growing on part  of the stem a bag S in which this little bell has  been formed and when it is ready to start on its  journey the bag opens at the tip and the bell  struggles out How gracefully it now drives itself  along by shooting water in and out of the hole in its  thin veil as it contracts and expands its rim and  from the water thus driven in its mouth m takes  the minute living beings and digesting them in its  tube t sends the nourishment down the canals to the  rim and so over the whole bell while in the little  bags o in the canals it forms and carries the eggs to  be dropped down on some distant spot to grow up  into a new animaltree  Thus this minute bell is a living active creature  with all the necessary parts for swimming and feed  ing and also for forming eggs to give birth to young  ones by and by Its whole body is crowded with  lassocells though it does not seem greatly to need  them and what is much more interesting in many  cases it even bears on its rim the first attempts at  eyes and ears  Often the passage of these tiny bells through the  water can only be traced by some bright spots like  coloured gems set in its rim b b 3 Fig 22 Blue  scarlet orange all the most vivid colours seem chosen  to give them brilliancy and inside the spots are in  some cases to be found little grains of lime which  roll to and fro and probably form the simplest hear  ing apparatus in nature while some crystals which  refract light are the first beginnings of eyes  Is it too much to say that these minute jellybells  are fearfully and wonderfully made and that our  imagination sinks appalled when we have to believe  that such complex beings have sprung from the tiny  buds on the animaltree i Fig 22  In the early summer the sea is full of these little  bells rising like constant bubbles from the animal  forest below Some are mere microscopic specks  others as large as thimbles while some look like  glass cups floating in the sea They are all more or  less tinted with lovely and delicate colours and though  an unpractised eye cannot distinguish them yet they  may be caught in a fine muslin net swept through  the water and examined under a microscope or in  an aquarium while on a calm evening when the sea  breaks in ripples on the sand their presence is  betrayed by the glow of phosphorescence fringing  the shore   Figured by hand Divine theres not a gem  Wrought by mans art to be compared with them  Soft brilliant tender through the wave they glow  And make the moonbeams brighter where they flow  And now we will rest our eyes from straining to  c co the microscopic lassothrowers and turn to some  of the large jellyfish of the sea for after watching  the floating bells we cannot doubt that those enor  mous jelly masses which we see sailing along in the  ocean are their near relations Indeed those who  swim and bathe in the sea can testify feelingly to the  power of the poisonous lassos for to be stung by a  jellyfish is no slight matter and this sting is given  by the lassocells  Though jellyfish however are uncomfortable to  meet in the water they are most interesting to watch  from a boat or the head of a pier as they move  along dome foremost with a regular movement as if  by clockwork We scarcely realise how large they  are till coming close to them we lay an oar over  them and find perhaps that the dome measures a  foot and often two or three feet across while their  tentacles stretch from the head to far beyond the  stern of an ordinary boat From spring to late  autumn they may be seen when the weather is calm  sailing on the water not by means of a veil like the  jellybells for they have none but by the movements  of their huge umbrella which they contract when  storms arise and so sink down into the depths  What is the history of these huge soft masses  First we must notice how very little solid matter  life has to use in building up their bulky forms for  when a jellyfish of four or five pounds weight is cast  on shore and dried up by the sun a film weighing a  few grains is all that remains the rest was all water  Yet the creature is wonderfully made Take for in  stance the jellyfish shown in Fig 23 Its tawny  jellowish umbrella is full of canals carrying the  nourishment over the whole animal In its margin  THE LASSO THROWERS  rudimentary eyes and ears are covered with a delicate  hood to shield them from harm Powerful muscles con  tract and expand  the rim of the um  brella guided by  nerves lately dis  covered in these  animals while the  rnouth of the hang  ing stomach itself  hidden under the  umbrella has long  tawny lips which  trail behind it like  ribbon sea weed  and are most for  midable weapons  for they are crowd  ed with powerful  and poisonous las  socells A creature  which this jellyfish  has once seized in  its lips must die  for even if it can  get loose from the  strong grasp the  poison works and  it soon floats dead  on the water  Shrimps barnacles  even the strong  animals of the sea are devoured by this ferocious  lasso thrower as he moves lazily through the  water expanding and contracting the rim of his dome  and if it were not that he and his fellows are the  chief food of whales and porpoises they would com  mit terrible havoc in the ocean as they travel in  shoals of thousands together  And now at certain seasons of the year when at  night the sea glows with their phosphorescence some  of these large wanderers drop from under their huge  umbrella something which looks like a shower of  dust This shower is composed of a number of  minute jellybodies a Fig 24 swimming by means  of lashes or cilia and something like those which come  from a sponge see p 38 They have been hatched  from eggs within the umbrella of the jellyfish and are  setting off into life for themselves After a few days  four curious knobs b Fig 24 begin to appear upon  them and these increase every day till at last the  swimming animal settles down on a rock and becomes  a small hydra feeding peacefully upon minute sea  animals by means of its tender threads  This then is the young of our jellyfish a common  hydra like that of the pond Moreover this young  hydra seems to forget all about its wandering parent  age and often goes on for several years budding into  other hydras and living as though it had never had  anything to do with a jellyfish  But at last one day a change comes over some of   The phosphorescence is due to a glutinous fluid exuded from the  umbrella This fluid when squeezed from a large jellyfish into twenty  seven ounces of cows milk made it so phosphorescent that a letter could  be read by the light at a distance of three feet  the hydras of the colony which may be greatgreat  grandbuds of the hydra which settled down  They lengthen out and their bodies divide into  rings c and d Fig 24 and as these rings grow  deeper and deeper the tentacles fall away from the  Fig 24  a Swimming jellybody b The same fixed to a rock which may  go on

top a complete saucer   and turning over so that the domed part is upper  most begins to contract and expand its rim and sails  away a minute jellyfish Other rings follow in its  path and the descendant of the fixed hydra has again  become a group of wandering lassothrowers  And now the floating domes begin to grow rapidly  in each one the umbrella thickens the stomach with  its huge lips begins to lengthen and expand the  eyespots develop under their hooded covering the  tentacles sweep out into the sea and the shoal of  terrible monster jellyfish is abroad again  all in motion  Far away upon the ocean  Going for the sake of going  Wheresoever waves are flowing  Wheresoever winds are blowing  And here we must leave them The history of all  jellyfish is not exactly alike for they do not all go  through the strange transformations just described  The beautiful purple Portuguese manofwar with its  rosetinted jellysail is born a wanderer like its parent  and so are also the lovely HangingBells which  have from ten to twelve and even sometimes as  many as sixty clear transparent bells hanging from  their stalk like blossoms on a flower while a clear  bubble shining like quicksilver serves as their float  These and many others have each their special history  for those who care to study them and even this brief  glance at the wandering lassothrowers will surely  lead us to look with more interest on the shapeless  dying lump of jelly on the seashore now that we  know it to have been an active living animal with  powerful weapons sensitive nerves and jewelled eyes  After following the free adventurous life of a  travelled jellyfish it seems almost like visiting some  quiet little country village to turn to the dreamy sea  anemones living from day to day in their rocky  pools How still and beautiful they are with their  brilliant greens and reds and yellows when after  lying closed like mere lumps of jelly they open out  into gorgeous flowers  The sea anemone really stands higher in life  than the hydra and its companions for the tube  of its body is double one  end being doubled back  within the other so as to  make a small sac hanging  within a large one while  a hole at the bottom of the  little sac or stomach opens  into the bodycavity below  The wall of the body be  tween thetwobagS is divided Section of a SeaAnemone  into a number of narrow having special darts d  which shoot out when it is at  partitions j Fig 25 upon tacked m Mouth s Stomach  the Sides of which the eggs showing the partitions on the   sides of which the eggs are  of the young anemones are f ormeL ff Co il of lassothreads  formed and OUt of which in the stomach t Tentacles  the tentacles spring as hoi f are crowded with lass  low tubes  Yet it is more in the way of fleshy growth than  in sagacity that the anemone has advanced for in  sensitiveness to light and power of movement he is  far behind the floating jellyfish This is indeed to  be expected for in his quiet stayathome life he  needs a strong muscular body but not active senses  and so we find that while his lassos are powerful and  many his sight is only enough to lead him to move  towards the light and he shifts slowly along when he  wishes to change his place or floats with his disk  upwards without being able to choose his own path  His fishing and feeding powers on the contrary  are very great Any one who has placed his finger  among the tentacles of a seaanemone will have felt  how they cling to it so that it is not always easy  to draw it away The touch has in fact burst a  number of lassocells and the threads have pierced  the flesh though they are too fine to give pain Mr  Gosse once cut off a piece of his own skin with a  razor and put it to the tentacles of the dahlia  anemone Tealia crassicomis and when he afterwards  examined it under the microscope he found it full of  lassothreads standing up like pins in the skin and  showing what wounds an anemone can inflict Now  when we reflect what a large number of tentacles  many anemones have a fullgrown daisy anemone has  more than seven hundred we see that they must  possess an almost countless number of lassocells  and that small sea animals such as shrimps worms  mussels seaslugs and young fish must fall easy  victims to the poisonous threads Even if any crea  ture is so well protected by its shell as to escape the  darts it is encircled by the numerous arms and thrust  into the stomach at the bottom of which it meets  with another thick coil of lassothreads c Fig 25  which are soon fatal  In this way the seaanemones obtain abundance  of food and they seem able to devour an almost  unlimited amount But they in their turn are evi  dently very open to attack having such soft defence  less bodies and in fact thousands of them must be  devoured every day by seaslugs and other animals for  they multiply so very rapidly that otherwise the whole  shore would be covered with them A seaanemone  can increase in three ways either by splitting in half  or by throwing out buds or as is most common by  hatching the young from eggs within its body It is  most curious to see in an aquarium how quickly a  crop of young seaanemones springs up round the old  ones Mr Holdsworth found that daisy anemones  sometimes throw out as many as 146 160 and even  300 in one day It is very difficult to see the young  anemones born because they are at first so small  but by careful watching they may be seen coming  out through the mouth of their parent sometimes in  the shape of little hairy or ciliated swimming bodies  but more often as perfect tiny anemones which have  lived inside their mother till their tentacles have  grown After they have been hatched among the  partitions in the anemones body they generally travel  into her hollow tentacles and from there they are  passed out through the mouth Then after walking  about a little while on the tips of their tiny arms  they settle down and begin their life  The first thing they learn to do is to expand to  find food and this they do by taking in water at  their mouth or through their skin and so swelling out  the whole body But should an enemy come by  they soon force the water out again and become a  small lump very difficult to seize It is most  interesting to watch an anemone when it wishes to  expand gradually filling itself with water and  stretching its tender skin till each tentacle falls in its  place as a graceful flexible tube and then again in a  moment if you touch it the water is squirted out and  every delicate part drawn in within its tough hide  But if you touch a daisy anemone or a cave  dwelling anemone in this way you will find that it  has another weapon of defence hidden in the body  tube itself All the members of this family of  anemones Sagartiadcz have minute slits scattered  over the outside of their tube and if you offend them  these slits open and long white threads d Fig 25  are shot out to strike you These threads come from  the coil of lassos within the body they are not them  selves lassos but long darts crowded with lassocells  and after they have punished the enemy that attacks  them they can be drawn in again to be used next  time By far the larger number of British anemones  have these darts called Acontia so that we find even  these sluggish stayathomes well able to fight the  battle of life  But mingled in among these soft lassothrowers  even on our English shores we find small examples  of a still more wonderful race whose history in the  warm depths of the Mediterranean and amidst the  stormy surge of the Pacific is like a fairy poem Who  has not heard of the groves of lovely red coral seen  through the clear blue waters off the coasts of Corsica  and Sardinia or read of those islands which are built  in the midst of the stormy Pacific by the delicate  coral animal There in the midst of violent foam  ing breakers strong circular stony reefs crowned with  delicate white sand and shaded by the cocoanut  palm enclose those peaceful lagoons where   Life in rare and beautiful forms  Is sporting amid the bowers of stone  And is safe when the wrathful spirit of storrm  Has made the top of the waves his own  And the coralanimal which builds alike the blender  pink stem of the coral ornament and whole islands  of rock in the midst of the sea is a lassothrower  In the Mediterranean he is a delicate dainty  being beginning life as a little jellybody thrown out  of the mouth of a pure white polyp growing out of a  red coral branch This jellybody soon settles down  on the seabottom a Fig 27 and spreading out its  tentacles b Fig 27 to feed takes carbonate of lime  from the water and colouring it we scarcely know how  begins to build with it red spikes or spicules into its  jelly flesh only into its mouth and stomach it lays no  spicules but leaves them soft and white Then after  a while it begins to throw off buds as we have seen  the hydra do and some anemones and each of these  buds remains on the stem pure and white while the  jelly full of red spicules joins them all together  c Fig 27 And then as more and more buds are  formed

water over their heads is all they ask in order  to flourish happily and send out plenty of young ones  to keep up the colony and though they have their  enemies in the seaworms and in the fish which nibble  at their tender flesh yet by means of their spicules  they hold their own while with their lassos they catch  their prey  A far hardier and more sturdy animal is the  builder of the white coral as he stands out in the  midst of the wild Pa  cific the stormy sea  dashing against his  home while he has  nothing but the power  of life and growth  to bring against it  Nevertheless he not  only lives but builds  strong stony barriers  which shut out the rest  less waves and enclose  calmstill salt lagoons  in whose depths more  delicate corals can  nestle and flourish  To understand how  the white coral builds  its skeleton we must  look back to the sea  anemone and to the  partitions in the wall  of its body p 67  The white coral is in  fact a group of sea  anemones all growing together and throwing out  buds which remain on the stem and each bud as it  takes the carbonate of lime out of the water builds  it up in solid layers between those partitions in its  body If you can find at the seaside the little Devon  shire cupcoral Fig 30 which is a single coral of this  kind you will be able to see clearly these solid par  titions entirely enclosing the body In this way the  animal is fairly shut in only the stomach with its  mouth and tentacles remaining free and as it buds  and buds feeding greedily with its lassos and laying  down lime particle by particle out of the restless  sea it builds a firm skeleton sometimes branched  see Fig 29 some  Fig 30  times solid as in  the brain coral  according to the  way in which the  buds are given off  one from the other  And

the sea carried down the dead coral as a solid  wall is a story which belongs to geology Here we  have only to picture the living animal tiny and tender  yet strong in its two great powers the power of  catching and feeding on the creatures of the sea and  the power of building a solid skeleton with the grains  of lime In this way day by day stretching out  their tender arms and flinging their lassos by millions  and millions in the midst of the wild Pacific the  coral animals live and grow In the midst of winds  and storms they struggle on the rough and strong  builders without in the open ocean the more tender  and delicate ones with their bright coloured orange  crimson scarlet and purple tentacles within the shel  tered lagoons they all make good use of the weapons  with which life provides them and flourish in countless  numbers enjoying the warmth of the tropical sea and  laying the foundation of solid rocks for ages to come  This brings us to the end of our brief sketch of  the lassothrowers of which the sea is so full Though  we have scarcely been able to glance even at the  leading forms we can understand how they are able  to maintain their ground in the struggle for life  One and all they sweep the waters with their tiny  arms and whether as animal trees jellyfish ane  mones or corals multiply in great numbers and fill  the sea with beautiful active life If only as food  for other animals they have their great use in the  world for the huge whale is greatly dependent for his  nourishment upon the shoals of jellyfish which throng  the Arctic ocean and many shellfish and other sea  animals feed upon the anemones and delicate polypes  on the seabottom But beyond their use to others  is the great fact that they live and flourish themselves  like the rest of Lifes children they crowd into the  world and as we watch thm during their brief career  we cannot but think that there is enjoyment in these  fragile existences as they open out so freely and  eagerly in the depths of the quiet ocean and that  from them too rises the silent hymn of praise for the  gift of life even if it have its struggles and its dangers  CHAPTER V  HOW STARFISH WALK AND

their nation  SPENSER  NCE upon a time in a quiet  seabay on the south shores of  Great Britain five curious little  oval jelly bodies were swimming  about by their jellylashes in  the depths of the smooth water  They had one and all been   hatched from eggs not long be  fore and their business and duty  in life was to grow up into some  form in which they could gain their  living and protect themselves from  harm  As each one came from a parent  of a different shape and character it was natural that  they should follow different roads although they all  worked much upon the same general plan and though  they were so small as to be scarcely visible they soon  began to put on each their own peculiar shape  No I had not swum about for many hours before  some limeplates began to form in his body arrang  ing themselves in the shape of a cup a A Fig 31  and below these other and smaller plates took up  the form of a stalk b  This went on for several  days while the jellybody  fed and swam about like  any other living animal  but it proved after all to  be only the cradle of the  real creature for after a  time the jellybody began  to shrink up and the  whole sank to the bottom  of the sea and a strong  limeplate was formed  which fastened the lime  A The jelly animal swimming Stalk to the rock where  by its lashes The cup b The the an j mal re mained  stem c The fixing plate of

spread  over the stem and cup The jellyanimal had in  fact become transformed into a Crinoid or Stone  Lily about halfaninch high which soon put out  jointed arms from its cup and fed in the water and

to float and feed in this shape for a  considerable time Meanwhile just within his mouth  some small cells appeared which gradually formed  themselves into a round disc By and by it was  clear that a trelliswork of lime was forming over this  disc b Fig 32 and five tiny stony arms c began  to grow out of it like the rays of a star Still how  ever the jelly animal continued to feed through its  jelly mouth like any other living being Then after  a time during which there was built up within the  disc a stomach a mouth and a set of tubes for taking  in water the disc with its sprouting arms all at once  dropped off its rods and swallowed up the jellybody  drawing it in till only a thin film was left over the  stony star Then after swimming about for a little  time it settled down upon the rock and wriggled  about a tiny Brittle StarFish B Fig 32  A Jellyanimal swimming about and the starfish forming within it  A The starfish settling down B The same assuming its true shape  No 3 followed much the same course as No 2  except that his jellybody had no rods in it but  took a number of curious shapes and swam about  briskly while within was formed a young creature  with a network of lime over his back A Fig 33 and  a number of small soft transparent tubes under his  body After a time the whole fell to the bottom of  the sea and this little creature also swallowed his jelly  body and becoming a tiny yellow rosette with five  knobs sticking out of it glided quickly away over  the rocks carried along by the little tubes under the  rosette It went on growing for two or three years  lengthening the five knobs into pointed rays and  became the common Five Fingered Starfish  that had gone before him He  too had long thin rods in his  body all pointing one way  so that his body looked like  a painters easel and at the top  of the easel a number of fine  plates of lime began to form  in the shape of a tiny round  box b Fig 3 4 A with prickles  all over it and by and by this  box sucked up the jellybody  leaving only a thin film over its  shell and sinking to the bottom  a tiny SeaUrchin burrowed  a hole for itself in the sand  Lastly No 5 did not form  anything

shall understand better presently let us first visit  the common starfish after his arms are full grown  as we sometimes find him on the sand of the sea  shore thrown up by the waves A strange and   The jelly animal does not always swim about in the water  while forming its future body Some starfishes and seaurchins carry  their young in a kind of pouch or tent till they have taken shape  t Echinodermata or hedgehogskinned  weird life he leads clinging to the wet roofs and sides  of caverns or hiding under large stones or wandering  over the sand at low tide with the water rippling  gently over his body the sea must appear to him  in a very different light from what it does to the  coralbuilders or jellyfish as they wave about their  soft tentacles and bathe them in the element they  love  For the real interest of the starfish is not in the  sea above but in the solid ground below He cares  for the water only that he may get oxygen out of it  to breathe for though he can swim when it is neces  sary yet he is really a creeping animal and loves to  climb over the rocks or poke about the sandy bottom  with his mouth down to the ground feeding on mus  sels and other shellfish wherever he can find them  No ghost could glide more smoothly or with less  noise than he does as he wanders dreamily along  and when he comes to a wall of rock or a hollow in  the sand he does not avoid them but bends his body  over the one or slides down the other hugging the  ground closely as he goes And yet the machinery  by which he moves is nowhere to be seen nor will  you be able to guess how it works till you pick up the  first living starfish left upon the shore as the tide  goes down and put it into a glass pan or jar of salt  water Then you will be able to watch this curious  movement through the glass At first he will lie  helplessly at the bottom but very soon although as  you look down upon him you will not see any special  part move the whole body will begin to glide slowly  along Now lift the jar and look at the under part  of the body You will see hundreds of tiny trans  parent tubes moving in the groove under each of his  five rays A Fig 36 and 1 1 Fig 37 The whole of  the under part of his body will be waving like a field  of corn as each tubefoot in its turn is stretched out  bent forward and fastened to the glass Then after  drawing the body a little on it will loosen again and  collapse into a mere knob while another will lengthen  out and take a hold In this way as tube after tube  draws it forwards the body of the starfish will be  A The common fivefingered Starfish The dark round spot  between the lower rays is the waterhole B The Brittle Starfish t  carried easily along the bottom or up the sides of the  glass like a canopy resting upon the heads of more  than two thousand bearers  And now if you look in the centre of the under  part of his body you will see a small opening with  the skin puckered up round it This is his mouth  m Fig 37 and if ycu place a small mussel or lim  pet against the glass on his road you will see a curious  sight He will glide gently over it as though it were  a mere stone till his mouth is just above it then the  middle of the body will rise a little and the feet all  round the mouth fixing themselves firmly to the  mussel will draw it into the opening where it will  remain till all its soft body is sucked out and then  the empty shell will return  If however the shellfish is too large to go into  the mouth the starfish will apply its lips to it and  often push its stomachbag S Fig 37 out at the  opening and half cover its victim and after a time  when it draws back the soft animal will be gone and  only the shell remain  A The central body S The stomach m The mouth h Per  forated hole

v Vesicles or waterbags supplying the tube feet with  water i Liver  The starfish then is a kind of walking stomach  borne along by hundreds of tiny feet ceaselessly  moving in each of its five rays and it is the working  of these feet which we must now explain To picture  to yourself the inside of a starfish imagine a round  central dome covered hall A Fig 37 in the floor  of which is a trap door m the mouth and out of  which open five stately arched corridors one of which  is shown in Fig 37 which begin as lofty galleries  and end in a point where a tiny window e vs set  The roof and floor of the corridors are built of deli  cate white columns and arches of lime joined by soft  ligaments while the walls are inlaid with starlike  plates and within the dome and stretching right  out into each corridor lies the soft body of the ani  mal S z Fig 37 with its digestive organs The  delicate telegraph of nerves and the watercanal  starting from the central hall pass like the wires  and pipes of our houses under the floor of each cor  ridor while the numberless little waterbags which  move the regiment of feet pierce the floor and lie in  the corridor itself  And now how does this apparatus work Remem  bering as we do that the anemone spreads out its  tentacles by filling them with water we shall expect  that something of fhis kind also happens here only  that we require besides to explain how the feet cling  so firmly to the ground for in some cases they will  even break off from the body sooner than release  their hold  If you look carefully at the back of a starfish  you will find a little round spot see A Fig 36 and  i Fig 37 lying at one side in the angle between  two of the rays This spot is a little plate of lime  pierced with fine holes just like the rose of a water  ingpot and through it seawater carefully filtered  passes down a tube into a hollow ring r round the  animals mouth and this ring opens again into canals  which pass along under each of the rays Here then  we have a regular watersupply taken in at the porous  plate and carried along all the five rays But we  want next a separate cistern for each tubefoot for  we have seen that they move separately and so can  not all be filled with water at the same time These  separate cisterns we find in a number of elastic bags  or vesicles v v Fig 3 7 placed along the watercanals  and opening into them on the one hand and on the  other into the tubefeet Now when water is taken  in at the grating h above the canals are filled and  they fill the vesicles and each vesicle is able to con  tract and force its water down into its own foottube  thus stretching it out Then the foottube while  stretched at full length can by drawing in its walls a  little force some water back and so draw up the  centre of the round cushion at the end of its tube  making a sucker just as a schoolboy does with wet  leather on a pavement then the foot holds fast  Lastly by drawing up the muscles which run down  the tube the body is drawn on the sucker released  and the foot pulled back to begin again  This is how the starfish walks and when we re  member how many hundreds of feet he has how  firmly each one holds and how slightly it moves we  cease to wonder that he glides so smoothly and clings  so firmly to the rock He is a greedy creature whose  whole care is his stomach and he will eat any animal  food he can find from small crabs shellfish and  other seacreatures to mere garbage and decaying  matter so that he is very useful as a scavenger of the  sea He in his turn is eaten by the cod the haddock  and other fish but he is better protected from smaller  This grating is called the Madreporiform tubercle  enemies than would appear at first sight His thick  skin contains a network of hard scales which will  turn the edge of a knife if you try to cut it while  pointed spines j stand in ridges on his back and  on the sides of the rays thus protecting the tubefeet  But the most curious weapons he possesses are a  number of minute claws like birds beaks mounted  on stalks V Fig 37 which stand round his spines  and twist and snap continually as long as he is  alive The only use that has yet been found for  these curious weapons is to clear the skin of the  starfish from the seaweeds and small animals which  would certainly fix themselves on such a sluggish  animal if they were not picked off We shall see  presently in the seaurchin that they are sometimes  very active in this work  And now as the starfish plods on his way along the  seabottom thinking only of the creatures over which  he can spread his capacious mouth what has he to  tell him of coming danger How shall he be warned  if the shadow of an enemy is passing over him or if  he is venturing too rashly into the broad sunlight  where his bright colours might attract dangerous  attention If you notice any starfish when it is  alarmed or finds itself in strange quarters you will  see it curl up the tips of its rays and there under  the point of each ray e Fig 37 may be seen with a  magnifying glass a thick red spot seated on the ex  tremity of a nerve and having in it as many as from  100 to 200 crystal lenses surrounded by red cells  Here then we have a far better eye than that which  we found in the jellyfish and it is no wonder that  the starfish is so quick in finding food or enrages the  fishermen by discovering the bait which they put for  other animals for it turns out that this heavy stupid  looking animal is much more wideawake than he  appears In many cases a soft lid or feeler hangs  over the eyespot giving to it a curiously intelligent  look and Professor Forbes relates how once when a  beautifully delicate starfish called the Lingthorn fell  to pieces as he tried to lift it out of the water this lid  at the end of one of the arms opened and closed with  something exceedingly like a wink of derision  Our first walking animal then is by no means a poor  or feeble creature he has chainarmour woven into his  leathery skin with sharp spikes and snapping claws to  protect him a good digestion and a capacious mouth  to feed his greedy stomach a good array of nerves  quick feeling and eyesight together with a wonderful  apparatus for moving over the ground and when we  add to this that if he loses any of his rays he can  close over the wound and grow a new limb we see  that his powers of living satisfactorily are very great  We must not suppose however that the curious  walking apparatus of the starfish is perfect in all his  relations or that they all walk by means of suckers  any more than all spongeanimals can build a toilet  sponge or all slime animals make fine chambered  shells The rosy featherstar for example Fig 3 8 as  it sits clasping the rock or a bunch of seaweed with  the fine strong tendrils which grow out of its back  waving its arms like a group of brilliant red plumes  spotted with bright yellow has no need to use any  feettubes though it is a starfish and those which  it has probably serve merely as a help in breathing  You will at first be puzzled to think how this  featherlike fixed animal can be a starfish at all but if  you examine it carefully you will find that it is indeed  one only turned upside down Its back which is  held down to the rock by some claws c which grow  upon it forms a cup in which lie the soft parts of its  body with a mouth m in the middle of course  turned upwards and surrounded by tentacles Its  five arms have divided each into two making ten  stony jointed rays r and on these a number of  finer jointed filaments give the appearance of feathers  Within a groove of each arm lie the feettubes but they  have no suckers for the featherstar rarely walks and  then only wriggles in a clumsy manner something  like a brittlestar It usually remains anchored feed  ing on the minute beings in the water which it drives  into its mouth by hundreds of cilia or jellylashes  which line the grooves of the arms  It does not care to move at any time though it  can swim gracefully through the water when disturbed  from its hold But in its infancy it was not even  free to do this for the lovely featherstar is nothing  more than the cup of the little stonelily A Fig 38  and Fig 31 which has broken from its stem and  grown up into a free animal In the early spring you  may find it in its infant state in the quiet bays of our  west coast or of Ireland like a white or yellow stony  flower growing on fronds of seaweed or on small stony  corals Its stem of jointed plates is covered with a  film of living matter and its cup has the stony threads  hanging down from it which afterwards serve as  claws to hold it to the rock In the autumn you will  find it so no more The cup a Fig 31 p 78  floating off its stem will have emancipated itself  from the race of fixed stonelilies and joined the  free starfish thus forming a curious link between  these two groups of animals It still however keeps  much of its old habits and while it can swim grace  fully from place to place loves better to cling to the  nearest rock or weed feeding upside down as com  pared to its new companions and waving its deep  red plumes a harmless thing of beauty  Not so the brittlestar B Fig 36 which as we  saw in Fig 32 was a free being from the first and is  as voracious as the common starfish and much more  active In some ways however it is like the feather  star for it has strong jointed suckerless arms and  feet which it never uses for walking although it  fills them through a porous plate like the starfish  Its soft body too is all contained within the round  cup in the centre and its arms do not open out of  it as in the starfish but are joined on and this may  partly explain why it so often flings its arms into a  hundred pieces when frightened for it can afford to  part with them and can soon form them again  As tools and weapons however they are most  useful and the reason why the brittlestar does not  use its tubes as feet is that its arms are quite  sufficient to carry it along Made of a number  of small plates joined together by elastic muscles  and fringed with hooks and spines these stony rays  serve both as walking and feeding apparatus The  animal twists them to and fro in all manner of  contortions and in this way is carried over the rocks  at a surprising pace while it can bury itself in the  sand and mud with the greatest ease or wriggle into  the smallest crevices if it fears to be attacked  If the starfish is remarkable for its smooth gliding  motion the brittlestar is the prince of wrigglers and  must escape many dangers by its bewildering activity  Indeed we may almost fancy that its enemies may  be as startled at its wild contortions as the fishermen  were who dredged the brittlestars up for Professor Ed  ward Forbes and begged to be allowed to throw them  back saying the things werent altogether right  On the other hand there is little doubt that they  use their arms to carry food to the mouth and one  of this family called the BasketFish has its rays  so branched and curled that they interlace forming  a stony network in which crabs and small fishes are  entangled and so caught for food  Here we have then three types of pricklyskinned  animals all bearing rays and all having the same pecu  liar watertubes yet each of them has his own differ  ent life the featherstar scarcely yet caring for his  freedom feeding almost in the same way as the  polyps do among the lassothrowers the brittlestar  with his active restless arms wriggling into cracks  and seizing young crabs and shellfish in his grasp  and the gliding starfish with its thousands of tube  feet creeping over its victims and carrying havoc  wherever it goes  But we have by no means yet exhausted the  quaint designs of this ray like structure on the  contrary we come now to the most fantastic and  whimsical creatures not only among the tubefooted  animals but perhaps among all the inhabitants of  the sea  Is it because the seaurchins know themselves to  be as grotesque as the goblins of fairy tales and as  uncanny as rolled up hedgehogs seen in the dim  moonlight that they hide themselves so persistently  in the cracks of rocky pools or bore holes in the  limestone in which to hide their prickly bodies or  wrap themselves up in seaweed packed deftly between  their spines Or is it not more likely that they  know too well the brittleness of their formidable  looking spines and either keep out of the way of the  rolling waves and currents or protect themselves from  their violence by a padding of soft seaweed  Be this as it may they are not always easy to  find alive unless by those who know their haunts  under large stones on the sand or who fish for them  in deep water yet they are plentiful on all our  coasts and most people have picked up fragments of  their shells upon the beach When they are found  however and placed in salt water they well repay  the trouble of a search if only because they are so  different from anything we have seen before  Imagine a hedgehog rolled up tightly into a ball  and beginning to walk along not on his feet but on  the tips of his spines as if on stilts and putting out  here and there long fine tubes like threads of gutta  percha to anchor himself on his road and you will  have a fair picture of a walking echinus or seaurchin  as he moves slowly along an aquarium or over the  rocks on the seashore There is something singu  larly whimsical in the  movement of this prickly  ball as it gravely lifts  some of its sucker feet to  plant others guiding it  self the while by its  movable spines Each  spine looks so knowing  turning itself round by  its ballandsocket joint  apparently making its  own little excursions  ASeaUrchinwalkingonarock w i t h OU t regard to what   Walkng tubes the other spines are doing  and in large specimens  where the little claws can be seen round the spines  twisting and snapping incessantly the effect is more  comical than can be expressed in a description  But our seaurchin is something more than amus  ing he is a most wonderful example of how animals  can be built upon the same plan and yet so altered to  suit their life that we should scarcely recognise them  as relations Looking at a seaurchin who would be  lieve that it has anything in common with the star  fish Yet if you examine it without its spines a rough  description will soon explain how alike they are  Suppose you were to take a dead starfish and  bend its rays backwards till they meet round the  disc of the back sew the  tips there and then sew  the five rays together up  the sides so as to form a  ball flattened in the mid  dle you would then have  the mouth of the animal  m Figs 37 and 40 un  derneath the ball and the  five rows of feet A Fig  36 A Fig 40 running A Sea Urchin after its spines have  Up it While the edge of been rubbed off  each ray where there are m Mouth fh Foot holes  no feet would touch throu g h which the alkin g tubes  pass wn The water hole e Eyes  the edge of the next S Sockets of larger spines  ray making two rows of  footless strips between each group of suckers If  you could now blow out this ball so that the mouth  and back were some distance apart and the whole  was round this would roughly represent our sea  urchin without its spines  We see then that the tiny urchin which came out  of the jellyanimal No 4 grew up strictly according  to the true raylike or radiate plan and yet what a  change he has made and what a snug home he has  formed round his body  By laying down plates of lime within his soft flesh  he has built a strong box in which all his soft parts  are enclosed and at the same time has managed to keep  a complete communication with the outer world His  suckerfeet which act exactly like those of the star  fish lie safely within the box till he needs them and  then each one is put out at a tiny hole like a pin  prick in one of the rows JK The porous plate  wJi supplying them with water is at the top of the  shell in the back where it would be in the starfish  and in the other plates near it are the openings out  of which it passes its eggs But where are its eyes  Consider for a moment where they ought to be upon  the star fish plan At the tip of each ray and  therefore when the rays are turned up so that the  tips meet round the back they will be at the top of  the shell where you will find five small holes contain  ing eyes e not so perfect as those of the starfish  but sufficient to see light  Could a stronger or safer fortress have been  designed even by the most ingenious engineer No  single soft spot is left bare to attack except the skin  round the mouth and this is always turned to the  ground and defended by the spines projecting on all  sides The mouth itself is a most complicated piece  of mechanism with five strong teeth set in powerful  jaws which lie inside the shell  And now how is this box to grow The tiny  seaurchin left nestling in the seaweed has to grow up  to a large animal sometimes as big as a pomegranate  and yet its body is tightly shut in within lime walls  Look again at the shell after it is stripped of its  spines Fig 40 and you will see that it is made of  more than a hundred separate plates While the  animal is living these plates are covered within and  without by a slimy film and this film passes also  between each plate Now as the animal grows it  takes fresh lime from the seawater into this film  and places it atom by atom evenly on the edges of  the plates and so the shell grows with the body with  out disturbing any part and if this does not give  sufficient room it can also add some plates to the  top of the shell at the end of each ray  So the seaurchin lives and grows wandering over  the seaweed beds and grazing with his powerful jaws  as a sheep grazes in a meadow Though the shells  of animals are sometimes found in his stomach they  are not his proper food for he is a vegetarian and  might probably almost be said to chew the cud in  his powerful jaws which Aristotle called by the  curious name of lantern from their peculiar shape  He has many powerful enemies and his shell is  often found in the stomachs of large fish and other  seaanimals so that besides his strong box he has  great need of his spines for protection and he can  give very sharp pricks with them from out of his  hidingplaces when he is interfered with His spines  however serve many other purposes They guide  him when he walks they help him to burrow in the  sand they have even been seen passing seaweed and  other objects over his body and they help the little  snapping claws to clear away any refuse which may  gather on the shell Lastly the seaurchin which  like the starfish often protects its young ones in their  soft infancy will sometimes gather the spines together  at the top of its house and so form a tent for the  tender young urchins till they are fit to go alone  The snapping claws which we found before in the  starfish exist in numbers on the shell of the Echinus  and are very puzzling they are so very active and  yet seem to do so little work They have often  however been seen passing away the little pellets of  refuse food which come out of a hole in the top of  the shell These pellets are handed down from claw  to claw till they can be dropped into the water and  so got rid of In the same way small worms and  seeds of plants and other living things are cleared off  the bristling shell by these busy little snapping beaks  The spines by their constant movement help as we  have seen in this cleaning process and have probably  many uses not known to us  Who will say when he examines the structure and  studies the habits of the Echinus that this child of  life is not a quaint clever wonderful and skilful  piece of mechanism as it lives and breeds by  thousands in the depths of the sea Any handful of  seaweed out of a pool at low tide will contain some  so small as hardly to be noticed while from the  rocky depths of the Mediterranean the fishermen  bring up large ones in order to sell their bunches  of eggs for food Yet as they stand in the Italian  markets feebly moving their spines round and round  in search of some of the old familiar objects in their  sea home how few people stop to examine the  curious box or to think of the history of its dying  architect  And now what has been happening all this time  to the small wormlike creature No 5 which we left  hidden in the rocks You will have to search well  in the crevice of some dripping cavern only lately  deserted by the tide and there you may perchance  find him bathing himself in a rocky pool a large  soft satiny sausage purple white or brown with five  delicate stripes down his body see Frontispiece and  a wreath of beautiful purple tentacles like fine sea  weed waving round his mouth What connection can  this wormlike creature have with the rayed animals  Wait awhile and look more closely Sluggish  though he is the Seacucumber does care to move  sometimes if only to fill his body with sand and so  get the particles of living matter which form his sole  food As he begins to glide along see from the  five stripes running along his body there appear a  number of tiny tubes with suckers see Frontispiece  by which he draws himself along Here then are  again our five rays of tubefeet but this time not  forming a star or gathered into a ball but stretched  out along a soft fleshy tube  It would seem almost as if here life had neglected  to arm the poor soft Sea cucumber or tired of  inventing prickly defences had fallen back again  upon a soft jellyanimal But the creature is not so  helpless as he appears for in his thick transparent  skin are strong muscles by which he can draw his   In some of the seacucumbers the rows of feet are all drawn  together on the under side of the body and this is the case in the form  which the artist has represented on p 82  body in and out much as a worm does and some  species have sharp hooks buried in their flesh which  both help them in moving and in wounding those  who attack them But his great safeguard is his  power of contraction Try some day to find a sea  cucumber in a crevice on the seashore and then  set to work to get him out You will feel him slip  through your fingers like an eel as he squeezes the  water out of his body and forces himself into a nar  row crack from which he cannot be dislodged with  out breaking the rock There is a safety in pliability  which is sometimes surer than a stout resistance and  where the prickly seaurchin might fall a victim the  seacucumber effaces himself and escapes  A curious mixture he is of the savage and the  cultivated animal Though he gorges himself with  sand which seems after all but a coarse way of  getting a living yet his body is more delicately  formed than that of any other pricklyskinned ani  mal and this makes it all the more strange that he  should have the power of throwing out nearly the  whole of his inside and yet living and growing it  again Sir John Dalyell found that a seacucumber  which had lost its tentacles its throat its network of  bloodvessels its intestines and its eggsac and had  literally nothing left but an empty tube lived and in  three or four months had regrown all the inside of  its body An animal which can exist like this and  is scarcely ever found with all its parts complete  because it has parted with some of them and yet is  healthy and strong need surely not envy the brittle  star its stony case and wriggling arms nor the sea  urchin its strong box  And now we have followed our five little jelly  bodies out into life and have found that they have  as much a real history as you or I have with real  struggles and difficulties which they can only over  come by using all their powers The varieties of  these five forms are far too many for us even to  glance at them There are the fixed stonelilies of  the deep sea which do not become free like the  featherstar There are brittlestars from a tiny star  with a disc as small as a pins head and arms like  fine threads to others measuring a foot and a half  across There are starfish large and small some  like stars others like fivesided plates others with the  rays turned back like a folded dinnernapkin There  are seaurchins round eggshaped wheelshaped and  flattened and from the size of a pea to that of a childs  head while there are others from warm seas with  three edged spines as thick as a little finger and  twice as long A visit to any good museum will  show these varying forms and though the seacucum  bers will not be so well represented because they  are soft animals yet you will find the Trepangs of the  Chinese with their black leathery coats and others  which are covered with plates of lime The beauti  ful Synapta which lives in our English Channel with  its lovely rosecoloured tube and its anchorbearing  shields you will not so easily find for it is so brittle  that it is very difficult to preserve This lovely  creature often a foot and a half long shelters itself  by a tube of sand built in rings by its tentacles and  passed down over its body by the microscopic anchors  buried in its soft flesh and by these anchors it also  draws itself in and out showing a new expedient used  by an animal in which the tubefeet are wanting  These and many other wonderful adaptations are  open to all to study but we must not linger over  them here One marked step we have made in this  division we have advanced from mere floating or  fixed animals to creatures able to wander freely over  the floor of the ocean The children of life have  now got their feet upon the ground but not yet  their heads above water In fact they have as yet  no heads to put anywhere Eyes ears mouths and  feet we have met with but no heads nor have any  of these animals been able to live out of their watery  home  But soon a new prospect opens before us and in  the mollusca or softbodied animals and the worms  we shall begin to enter upon earthlife Not sud  denly however for all new powers are of slow growth  and through many chapters yet we shall find the  largest number of each group clinging to their old  ocean home and only here and there airbreathing  and headcrowned forms mingling in the throng  CHAPTER VI  THE MANTLECOVERED ANIMALS AND HOW THEY  LIVE WITH HEADS AND WITHOUT THEM  See what a lovely shell  Small and pure as a pearl  Lying close to my foot  Frail but a work divine  Made so fairily well  With delicate spire and whorl  How exquisitely minute  A miracle of design  The tiny cell is forlorn  Void of the little living will  That made it stir on the shore  Did he stand at the diamond door  Of his house in a rainbow frill  Did he push when he was uncurled  A golden foot or a fairy horn  Thro his dim water world  TENNYSON  F all our many playthings  when we were children were  there any we loved better or  cherished longer than the shells  which we brought home from the  seaside and each of which we knew  not perhaps by name but as a shep  herd knows his sheep so that no  single one could be missing without  our detecting it  They may have been only com  mon shells such as the small pink  tinted scallops variegated topshells  small cowries or spiral turrets with  here and there a delicate razorshell treasured espe  cially because so easily broken Yet we felt in  stinctively that they were more beautiful than any  artificial toys and though probably we scarcely  thought of the animal which formed them yet the  delicate marking and tints of colour which each had  left upon his house pleased our eye more than gaudy  pictures or painted playthings  And even amongst older people is there any place  in the world where shells are not admired The  savage strings them into necklaces and so does the  refined lady of fashion while there is probably not  a house even the poorest in England where they  do not figure as ornaments from the giant conchs  and cowries of the South Seas brought home by  some sailor son to the little boxes made of our  common coast shells  Now each one of these millions of shells pre  served in all parts of the world as well as of the  countless multitudes which lie crushed and broken  on the seashore and at the bottom of the sea has  once been the home of a living animal which was  born wrapped in a transparent mantle endowed with  the wonderful power of extracting lime from the sea  water which it has taken into its body tinting it with  beautiful colours and building it up into a solid  house  This wonderworking mantle which life has given  to these softbodied mollusca mollis soft may easily  be seen in any common shellinhabiting animal such  as the oyster or the periwinkle When an oyster is  BrackiopoJa are purposely omitted in this chapter because although  familiar objects yet their structure is too difficult and their true position  too uncertain for them to be dealt with in a book of this kind  opened you may see two transparent flaps with  thickened edges one lying above and the other  below the oyster in its shell in Fig 41 p 108  and these two flaps are the two halves of the mantle  which when they touch enclose the animal between  them In the periwinkle the mantle is equally visible  but this time it is all in one piece and forms a com  plete transparent tube out of which the animal pokes  its head and its crumpled foot bearing the horny lid  or opercuhun which closes the shell  When the periwinkle was very young he was not  larger than the head of a small pin and his shell was  like a minute transparent bead But as his body  grew larger it was necessary for his home to be both  larger and stronger Then he stretched out his  mantle till it reached over the edge of the tiny shell  and gave out from it a thin film in which were grains  of lime which had been passed through his body into  the mantle This film clinging to the inside of the  shell and stretching over its edge formed a fresh  internal layer and a new rim to the mouth The  rim however was not white but coloured by little  cells of dark paint or pigment secreted in the border  of the mantle The shell was now a little larger and  a little thicker and the mantle was drawn in till a  still more roomy house was needed and then the  same thing took place again and so the building  went on till the shell was completed the lines round  and round it marking the rims which had each in  their turn formed its mouth  In this way the mantle not only of the periwinkle  but of all the mollusca builds up the shell for the  animal to live in In the oyster each half of the  mantle lays down its own separate valve and this is  the case with all those mollusca which have no  heads they all grow bivalve or twovalved shells  while those which have heads such as periwinkles  snails and whelks have their mantle all in one piece  and consequently grow single or univalve shells  Nor is this all for the shape colour and pecu  liarities of all the different shells come from pecu  liarities of the mantle If this is crumpled at the  edge or drawn out in hornlike folds then the shell  will have a crumpled form like the scallop or horns  like the murex while the sunlight falling upon the  mantle seems to help it in forming the bright pig  ment with which it paints its home so that shallow  water shells and those of the tropics are more brightly  coloured than those from the deep sea or from dull  climates Again in the inside of the shell if the  mantle leaves a smooth layer this will be white but  when the film is crumpled in very fine folds these  reflect the light in such a way as to give the beautiful  colours known as motherofpearl while if the mantle  be irritated at any point it will form in the oyster  or the mussel a little bead of lime afterwards to be  increased into a pearl  And now with this picture in your mind of the  mantle at work visit any good collection of shells  such as that at the British Museum and look at the  giant Strombs and Volutes of the Indian Ocean the  Pinnas from the Mediterranean half a yard long  with their erect curled scales the prickly Murex  with its delicate pinktinted lining and the gorgeous  purple Mussels Notice the rainbowcoloured cham  bers of the Nautilus the pearly lining of the Haliotis  and the lustrous transparent shell of the floating  Carinaria and then say whether the work done by  the mantle of the softbodied animals does not surpass  that of any sculptor or artist in the world  Yet this is not the chief object of the shell which  is meant to shield the delicate creature within and  does it so successfully that though the soft bodies  of the mollusca offer the most tempting morsels to  birds and insects on the land and to almost all the  inhabitants of the sea yet protected by their shelly  covering they spread into every nook and corner of  the globe giving birth to such multitudes of young  that in spite of all the havoc which thins their ranks  they flourish in abundance Even the   Poor patient oyster where it sleeps  Within its pearly house  although it is the most helpless of all the headless  mollusca would overspread all the deepsea banks  round our coast if we would let it alone The oyster  fishers have only to visit their wellknown haunts  about halfamile or a mile from the shore in Essex  Kent Wales and elsewhere to rake them up by  hundreds If you could dive down there to the bottom  of the sea you would find the oysters cemented firmly  to the rocks and to each other by the under part of  the largest valve which is cup like in the centre  where the body lies while the flatter valve is gaping  open and a stream of water is gently flowing over  the oyster within  The shells stand naturally open because they have  an elastic cushion c something like a thick piece of  guttapercha fixed within the hinge which acts like  a spring of a jackinthebox and drives the covering  valve up unless it is forcibly pulled down This  however can be done by  a strong muscle ms  which lies within the  valves and has one end  fastened to the upper and  the other to the lower  valve so that by con  tracting this muscle the  oyster can pull its shell  together with a snap  when danger is near  Close round this muscle  lies the body of the ani  mal between the two  flaps of the mantle m m   b O J y anc j growing to the  mantle a delicate transparent frill g of four striped  bands these are his gills or breathing apparatus   The fringes that circle its body  Which epicures think should be cleared  Are the animals lungs for tis odd he  Like a foreigner breathes through his beard  The stripes are tubes which run up and down  each fold and through them flows the sluggish  colourless blood of the oyster so that as the gills lie  bathed in water the blood takes in oxygen through  the delicate membrane and flows back to the body  purified and refreshed The remainder of the oyster  consists of its stomach digestive tube and dark  coloured liver Iv an ovary where the oyster eggs are  formed and a heart i with two chambers which  pumps the blood through the channels of the body  while fine nerves spread in all directions not yet  arranged in pairs along a cord as we shall find them  afterwards in insects but straggling to the various  parts from two chief centres  But where is the mouth Placing the oyster with  its deep shell downwards and the rounded part to  wards you you will find an opening o in the right  hand corner near the hinge and over it four thin lips  lp If you could watch the oyster alive you would  see that all the water passing over the gills flows  towards this mouth and the reason is made clear if  you put a small piece of a gill in water under the  microscope for then you will see a whole forest of  lashes waving over the surface of the gills like reeds  in a stream and striking strongly in one direction  namely towards where the mouth would be By  means of the action of these lashes or cilia the oyster  as he lies gaping in the water has a constant current  flowing over him which not only provides him with  breath but drives the helpless microscopic plants  and animals past his thin lips to be drawn in and  swallowed  But though the oyster has little trouble in obtain  ing his food he has much in preserving himself from  danger When he first comes out of the egg he re  mains for some time lying safely between the gills of  his parent but by and by he is cast out to make  room for others for one oyster may lay as many as  two million eggs in a year and swims away by means  of a number of lashes which extend beyond his thin  transparent shell Woe betide him then if he comes  near to a hungry fish or crab or seaanemone for  millions of young oysters are swallowed by these  animals yet he is not quite without help for at this  time he has two little red eyespots and can see his  danger whereas he loses these after he is fixed to  the rock Still even then his nerves seem sensitive  to light for his valves are said to close at once when  a boat passes over him in clear water and his sense  of touch is very acute all round his mantle and as  he builds his shell firm and strong he can show fight  against many intruders and live sometimes for ten  twelve or fifteen years  But it is amid many perils for the starfish can  apply his greedy mouth to the valves and stifle him  in his grasp and annelids or seaworms can work  their way into his shell while the whelk with his  rasping tongue bores right through it and feeds on  his tender flesh and if he escapes all these the  boring sponges destroy hundreds of his race by  riddling the shells with holes and growing upon the  graves of their victims Even his own children often  cause his death by settling down upon his upper  valve so that when a bank becomes densely popu  lated those underneath are stifled in a living grave  From the oyster which lives on banks at many  fathoms depth we will pass on to the mussel anchored  nearer to the shore on the mudbanks and groynes  which are uncovered at low water Here the waves  THE MANTLECOVERED ANIMALS  in  beat roughly and to be safe it is necessary to with  stand them But the mussels M Fig 42 do not  like oysters cement themselves down for life They  have a different stratagem which enables them to get  free if they wish They have below their body a  muscular flap which goes by the name of a foot  and is made up of layers of muscle crossing and  recrossing each other In this foot there is a deep  groove out of which they force a milky fluid which  hardens into threads f and anchors them to the  rock Any one who has tried to wrench mussels  from their bed knows how strongly these threads  hold and if you remove the mussels carefully and  put them in an aquarium you may see them anchor  themselves As soon as they grow a little accus  tomed to the place they will begin feeling about with  their foot to find a spot and then pressing the tip  firmly against it will draw it back after a time  leaving a thread behind The huge fanmussel or  Pinna common off Plymouth forms threads so silky  that they have actually been woven into gloves  The mussel then has the power of spinning new  threads and settling in new spots but he is prac  tically a stationary animal providing himself with  plenty of food by the rapid motion of his fringed  gills so that even young shrimps in spite of all their  efforts are carried into the whirlpool Then when  the tide goes down he closes his shell shutting in  enough water to last till the sea returns and it is  while he is left high and dry that the seabirds often  wrench him from the rocks and devour him  In the scallop S Fig 42 we get a step farther  for though he too forms a slight cable and anchors  himself to the rock yet he can in most cases with  draw it at will and dart through the water in long  rapid leaps so that a group of young scallops look  as if they were performing a dance Mr Gosse who  watched this in an aquarium saw the scallop draw as  much water as it could hold within its mantle and  then closing the edge squirt it out at one corner so  as to drive itself along in the opposite direction The  lima which is nearly related to the scallop and has a  lovely orange fringe to its mantle often builds a nest  with its threads working in pieces of coral gravel  and shells and fastens it to the seaweed lining it  with a smooth layer of slime and taking refuge in it  out of the way of crabs and fishes But the scallop  goes boldly out into the sea and you will not wonder  at its activity when you see its beautiful jewelled eyes  e set all round the rim of its mantle like precious  stones set in a ring You may easily see these eyes  peeping out at you through the halfopened shell in  any fishmongers shop and a pretty sight it is  The life of the cockle C Fig 42 is very different  True he can leap to a great distance by bending his  long foot and straightening it with a jerk but  he uses it chiefly to burrow in the soft sand and then  he draws his body down till only the tip of his shell is  uncovered and there he takes in water and food  Some cockles have the two flaps of their mantles  joined together and drawn out on the side opposite  the foot into two short tubes si Fig 42 down one  of which the water enters while it is thrown out at  the other  Lastly the razor fish whose shells we find so  often but whose bodies we rarely see scarcely ever  come above ground at all but burrow with their thick  foot till only the two siphons si are uncovered and  throw up jets of water by which the fishermen find  them when they dig them up for bait  We have bivalves then lying fixed in the deep  water anchored on the stormy shore and buried in  the sand nay more if we search at low tide we may  often find the rocks riddled with holes and on break  ing them open see within a Pholas an animal like the  razorfish but much shorter and with a beautiful deli  cate shell The Pholas has learnt to find a home in the  solid rock while the groynes of our shores and the  bottoms of our ships are destroyed by another true  bivalve the Teredo which is miscalled a shipworm  Then we can trace these headless mollusca from  their oceanhome gradually up into the fresh water  some forms living in the brackish water at the rivers  mouth others like the freshwater mussel buried in  the mud of rivers and these do not spin threads  since they have no rude waves to meet but put out  two short siphons to the pure water above All  kinds of different forms with their habits we may  study on the coasts and in the ponds and rivers  but we never find a bivalve either on the land or  sailing in the open ocean  Molluscs with heads Vegetablefeeders  L Limpet walking and attached P Periwinkle t walking and  closed Foot o operculum s snout g place where gills lie  under the shell  These regions they are obliged to leave to the  more highlygifted mollusca with heads and when  we have examined the little periwinkle grazing on  the seaweed among the rocks we shall I think be  able to imagine how it was possible for some of his  THE MANTLE COVERED ANIMALS  distant relations to venture into new hunting grounds  and become land animals  Watch a periwinkle some day in his home among  the rocks and see him gently lift his shell open his  horny door p Fig 43 and put out his head He has  two delicate tentacles to  feel with and just behind  these on very short stalks  are set two tiny but keen  eyes the nerves of which  join the great nervous  mass now for the first time  chiefly centred in a head  The under part of his  body is a flat crumpled  disk or foot as it is called  composed of muscles and  this when lengthened out  first on one side and then  on the other draws him  gently along the under  side being moistened from  time to time by slime  from a gland within On Th e ins d eofaPeriwinkle  account of this foot Foot OT musc le for drawing  being under the body back into the shell g spittle glands  the periwinkle and his

44 enable him to shorten or lengthen his  body at will If undisturbed however he finds his  way to a mass of seaweed pushes out his snout  s Fig 43 and moves very slowly along scraping  fine shavings off the weed as he goes so as to leave  minute dents behind him  This he does by means of a very curious instru  ment If you could look into his mouth which  opens on the under side of his head you would find  it paved with sharp teeth just as if a number of  nails had been driven into it point upwards and it is  with these that he rasps the seaweed as he rubs his  jaw along it  But this rough file wears away rapidly with con  stant use and to meet this difficulty he has a com  plete provision hidden within The rasp within his  mouth is only the end of 600 rows of teeth three in  a row growing on a long gristly strap like pins stuck  in a pincushion and this strap often two and a half  inches long closes its edges together at the back of  the mouth so as to wrap over the rough points  and is then rolled up into a coil and stowed away  in a fold of the neck r Fig 44 As the front  teeth wear away this strap comes gradually for  wards on the floor of the mouth the new teeth  grow up and are sharpened ready for use This  curious strap is generally called the tongue  though a rasp radula is a much more appro  priate name  And now as our periwinkle walks and feeds he  must also breathe and strange as it may seem to  us no creature below the backboned animals ever  breathes through its mouth Look back to the  earlier groups and you will see that the sponges  jellyfish and corals breathe through the skin while  the starfish takes in water not through his mouth  but through the perforated plate in his back the  oyster breathes by means of gills fringing his body  and we shall find by and by that insects breathe  through holes in their sides We must look then  for the gills of the periwinkle and we find them  safely lodged in a fold of his mantle over his neck  just within the broad part of his shell br Fig 44  There they are bathed in water drawn in by their  waving lashes and when the periwinkle is left high  and dry by the tide he pullsto his lid shutting in a  supply of water  The same is true of the limpet not that he has  any door to close but he clings so closely to the rock  that water is shut in all round his gills which fringe  his body just above the foot You would hardly  imagine at first that a limpet has a head like a  periwinkle but when he is covered by the water and  not afraid that the birds will peck at his tender foot  and carry him off for food you may see him lift his  shell and put out his head with its horns and make  a track off to the nearest seaweed where he grazes  steadily But when the tide goes down you will  find him back again in exactly the old spot where  he has worn a little basin for himself to lie in to  which he fits so closely that sometimes his shell will  have even grown a little deeper on one side than on  the other to fit some dent in his nook  These are the peaceful vegetablefeeders and the  margins of their shells when unbroken have always  unnotched rims but if you pick up a shell which  has a notch n Fig 45 in the margin as in a cowry  or whelk shell you may be almost certain that its  owner fed on other animals for fleshfeeders have  their mantle folded right round their gills and drawn  out into a tube or siphon through which the water  is taken in and the notch in the shell marks the place  where the siphon protrudes  Now these flesh feeders have to work much  harder for their living than the grazing limpet or  periwinkle Though they sometimes devour fish  and other soft animals yet their chief food is shell  fish and they have to reach them through their  closed houses The hungry whelk therefore has to  bore a hole through a solid shell before he can take  his meal and for this he is provided with a boring  instrument such as any engineer might envy His  snout which can be stretched out like the trunk of  an elephant contains a toothed rasp like the peri  winkles but much more formidable and this rasp is  moved up and down by powerful muscles so as to  act like a fine saw drilling a neat round hole even in  the hardest shell through which he can suck out the  soft body it contains It is curious that he does not  always know when he will find food within for he  will sometimes drill a hole not only in an empty  shell but even in a shelllike stone  While the periwinkle and his relations then are  grazing on the seaweed the whelks and cowries  and their tribe are finding means to attack the  oysters and cockles limpets and periwinkles and so  to establish a successful huntingground where there  would be no room for more vegetablefeeders and  you can scarcely pick up a handful of shells without  finding some pierced with the holes made by these  marauders They people the shores of the ocean all  over the world some carrying their eggs till they are  hatched some glueing them down in safe nooks others  such as the whelk laying them in a bunch of horny  bags E Fig 45 in each of which the young whelk  may be seen moving if you can pick them up fresh  from the sea And when the little ones are born  they are able to swim about as the young oyster  was and while myriads are borne away on the sea  and devoured by other animals the remainder settle  down and feed on the seabottom  This is the history of the seaforms and we have  now to glance at those on the land First we must  notice in passing the watersnails in the ponds and  rivers feeding on decayed leaves and travelling often  from place to place floating shell downwards on the  surface of the water or hanging from the waterplants  by slimy threads Some of these have and some have  not the horny door while some breathe by gills and  others are airbreathers Then we have not much  difficulty in recognising the landsnails as being very  like the periwinkle only breathing by air instead of  by water The way this is done is very simple If  you watch a snail when its head is out of its shell  you will see a little slit opening and shutting steadily  in the top of the neck and through this hole air is  passing into a closed chamber made by a fold of  the mantle The walls of this chamber are covered  with a network of bloodvessels through which the  blood flows taking oxygen this time from the air  instead of from water By this simple arrangement  the snail no longer confined to the sea and rivers is  able to spread over the fields and woods and gar  dens feeding on the delicate juicy leaves of plants  on mosses and fungi and all the rich vegetation of  the country But it has many dangers for birds and  hedgehogs and even insects prey upon it greedily  Therefore it feeds chiefly in the dusk of the evening  while it has sharp eyes e Fig 46 set upon long stalks  which can see on all sides when it is out of its shell  Now in order to retire safely into its shell it must  be able to draw in these eyes and also the two ten  tacles or feelers below and here we find a beautiful  machinery If you watch a snail drawing in its  horns you will see that the eye disappears down the  tube just as the tip of a glovefinger does when you  draw it down from inside the glove These horns  are in fact hollow tubes and a special muscle pulls  them in from the top downwards and when the eye  is wanted again it is only necessary for the muscles  round the tube to contract and so to squeeze the tip  gradually out  Most of the landsnails have lost the horny door  not having any need for it but in winter when they  sleep without food in the cracks of old walls under  the bark of trees and in other sheltered spots they  pour out a layer of slime which hardens and shuts  them into their shell till spring returns  Slugs C Fig 46 on the other hand bury them  selves in the ground for winter safety At first sight  you might imagine that a slug had no shell at all  but if you examine carefully you will find a small  shell s under its black skin just behind the neck  and the small breathing hole b at the side will show  you that this shell covers the breathing organs This  is in fact the only part of a slugs body which is  covered by the mantle and if you alarm him you  will see him draw his head in under it as though he  expected it to shield him from danger No doubt  the absence of a large shell enables the slug to creep  into many places where a snail cannot go and the  havoc worked by these creatures in our gardens  shows how rapidly and successfully they feed The  great gray slug has a supply of 2 8000 teeth so  that he can use them without scruple and if it  were not for the birds which devour both slugs and  snails at their work and some insects which destroy  their eggs the whole land would be eaten up by  them for they hide their eggs so cunningly in  the roots of plants in crevices and well sheltered  nooks that they multiply by millions  A Garden snail B B Testacellat one disappearing into the  ground and only the tail showing C The Great Gray SlugJ  s Shell tentacles t eyes b breathinghole  Yet even kept down as they are there is not vege  table food enough for all kinds and many feed on  other animals as for example the little testacella B  Fig 46 a queer little fellow which follows the worms  down into their holes and drags them down his  throat by his rasp of barbed teeth so that often  several worms may be found torn and mangled  within his body His breathing chamber has found  its way nearly to the end of his tail so that he can  breathe when the front of his body is buried while  the little shell s which covers it looks very comi  cal but is useful nevertheless in protecting it from  attack behind  All these many forms of watersnails and land  snails and slugs have taken possession of the land  and its waters and now if we go back to the sea we  find that the world has still room for other kinds  only they must fit into gaps that are not occupied  For wonderfully beautiful mantlecovered creatures  may be found there lurking under stones and in dark  corners if a careful search is made at low tide These  are commonly called seaslugs and by scientific  men the nakedgilled mollusca because they have  no shell or covering over their feather like gills   Fig 47 but carry them erect on their backs  like tufts of moss or delicate seaweed Yet in their  babyhood these naked animals lived in a tiny curled  shell and swam about by lashes like the young of all  the stomachfooted animals and we can still recognise  their nationality by their feathery gills and their  coiled rasping tongue Like the landslugs they can  creep through many a narrow opening not possible  for shelled animals and though their eyes are not  powerful they have very sharp ears a quick sense of  touch and sensitive nerves Especially their smell  is very acute probably in order to prevent them from  venturing into bad water where their delicate and  unprotected gills would be unable to work well  Though they are so fragile looking yet they eat  ravenously feeding on young corals sertularias and  sponges and often digging a good piece of flesh out  of a seaanemone with their scooplike rasp Some  of them are protected by spicules set in their flesh  but most of them are very tender and escape obser  vation by the wonderful resemblance of their colours  to those of the seaweed over which they wander and  whether floating or hanging by slimy threads or  crawling with their beautiful plumes outspread they  select chiefly the dark sheltered spots neglected by  the hardier children of Life  And now that the seashore the ponds and the  rivers are overrun with stomachfooted animals there  remains but the wide ocean And even there they  have made their way for sailors in the Atlantic Ocean  meet with the oceansnail lanthina with its float  of aircells floating in myriads over the sea and  feeding on the small jellyfish and with the lovely  I lanthina the oceansnail f Foot r raft of airbubbles with  eggbags hanging down C Carinaria Foot s shell covering the  breathinggills g

miles  with their swarms as they graze on the floating  seaweed  Life then has spread her mantlecovered children  far and wide over sea and land where each by  different devices finds food and shelter But it is not  with such tiny beings as these that we are to end  the history of the mantlecovered animals for lurking  in the holes and tidepools of the sea there are  much larger creatures with sac like bodies green  staring eyes horny beaks and waving arms which  unlike as they are to the ordinary shell animals are  nevertheless true mantlebearers  Who would imagine on seeing a cuttlefish with  its large pathetic eyes thrown up on the seashore or  an octopus shooting across its tank that these intelli  gent active creatures had any connection with the  helpless oyster or timid periwinkle Yet so it is  only while the oyster is one of the lower and feebler  forms the cuttlefish the octopus the argonaut and  the nautilus are the monarchs of the mollusca pro  vided with as powerful weapons for their work as  the dragonfly is among insects or the tiger among  beasts  Go some day and look at an octopus in one of the  aquariums Its baglike body appears to be a mere  mass of flesh yet it has really a most complicated  internal structure and a gristly framework more like  a true skeleton than any other animal without a back  bone Its mantle covers the body and forms a ring  round the neck often fitting so closely that its edge  can only be seen where there is a hole for taking in  water In a fold of this mantle are hidden the gills  and a short funnel si Fig 49 sticking out of its neck  is a tube for shooting out the refuse water which has  been taken in at the mantlerim Here we have the  secret of the rapid movements of the octopus for by  taking in a supply of water at the rim of his mantle  and sending it out in jets through the funnel he shoots  himself backwards just as a boat is sent through the  water by a stroke of the oar Nay more if he is  flying away from an enemy he has an additional  mode of defence for within his body is a gland which  secretes an inky fluid and this he squirts out through  the funnel making a thick dark cloud behind him  which baffles his pursuer at the same time that it  helps himself to dart away   Th endangered mollusk thus evades his fears  And native hoards of fluid safety wears  A pitchy ink peculiar glands supply  Whose shades the sharpest beam of light defy  Pursued he bids the sable fountain flow  And wrapt in clouds eludes the impending foe  Fishermen assert and Mr Darwin and others confirm  their opinion that the octopus and cuttlefish often  take deliberate aim at an enemy when they squirt out  this unpleasant fountain  But the chief and most powerful weapons of the  octopus are his socalled arms and his horny beak  Just below his large penetrating eyes is spread out a  crown of eight long tapering ribands a Fig 49 and  these are in fact his foot answering to that crumpled  muscular disk upon which the snail walks In the  octopus this foot has grown round the neck and then  divided up into segments and for this reason he and  the cuttlefish and nautilus are called headfooted ani  mals Cephalopoda The foot of the cuttles has ten  segments instead of eight and two are nearly three  times as long as the others  Now watch the octopus lurking in the rockwork of  the tank his round body squeezed into some nook  and his arms some grasping the rock others flapping  idly in the water If a large fish or crab pass by  instantly he is on the alert the arms in the water no  longer listless dart out and fasten on the luckless  animal which is dragged in to the strong beak stand  ing out in the centre of the arms and crunched in a  moment even the crabs shell cracking like a nut  while his flesh is devoured and carried down into the  stomach of the octopus by his fleshy tongue armed  with horny hooks But what gives the arms of the  octopus such power If you look at the under  surface of them you will find arranged in pairs along  each arm suckers s Fig 49 large near the mouth  and growing small as the strips taper to a point and  crowded so thickly that an ordinarysized octopus  with arms about a foot and a half long will have  nearly 2000 of them Each of these suckers is a  perfect little airpump with a piston in the middle  and the moment the octopus lays an arm upon any  creature a muscle draws the piston in each sucker  back This causes it to cling like a cuppingglass  and the more the victim struggles the tighter is the  grasp wnile the octopus holding by the suckers of  his other arms to the rock has a firmer and firmer  hold the stronger the resistance  One would almost imagine at first sight that long  experience would have taught the fishes and crabs to  keep out of the way of such a monster but the  octopus has another and almost unfair advantage  He carries in his transparent skin cells of colour  yellow blue red and brown and has the power like  the chameleon of changing colour and assuming the  tint of the rock under which he hides  New forms they take and wear a borrowed dress  Mock the true stone and colours well express  As the rock looks they take a different stain  Dappled with gray or blanch the livid vein  By this means he not only lies safely in wait to  pounce upon his prey but may himself escape the  notice of the dolphins or the conger eels which are  too strong for him to conquer and who in their turn  feed on his fleshy arms  With such advantages and weapons of attack can  we wonder that not only the octopus but also his  tenarmed relations the cuttles and the squids are  to be found of different sizes and kinds all over the  sea There is the little Sepiola often caught off our  coasts in the nets of the shrimpers whose body is  only about half an inch long with small flaps or fins  on the sides He like the cuttlefish so far clings to  the old habits of the mollusca as to form a long thin  shell on his back under his mantle and this shell we  call a pen when we find it on the shore because it  is shaped like one He makes himself a shelter by  blowing a hole in the sand with jets of water from  his funnel and uses the suckers of his arms to  remove and arrange the small stones Then he sits  in his hole with his large goggle eyes peering out  and catches the shrimps and smaller crabs as they  pass by There is the common cuttlefish which  forms in its mantle the white chalky shell known  as the cuttle bone It generally floats about or  creeps over the bottom of rocky pools till fright  ened or wishing to attack some animal it shoots  out suddenly a jet from its funnel and flies back  wards through the water clutching its prey on the  road The dark horny grape like bunches which  we find on the shore are the eggs of the cuttle  fish There are the Calamaries whose shell is a  horjiy pen and some of which living in the open  ocean have sharp hooks in the centre of their  suckers making cruel weapons of attack against  the unfortunate fish who have the sharp hooks  planted in their flesh and held fast by the cups  around them  Then there is our friend the Octopus with his body  squeezed between the rocks and nothing but his bright  gleaming eyes to betray him while his wife in another  sheltered nook is watching over her eggs e Fig 49  arranged in clusters on a stalk like a huge catkin  of a nuttree A loving mother she is sometimes  dandling the eggs in the hollow web of her arms or  cleaning them by spouting water from her funnel  over them as a gardener washes his plants with a  hose Week after week she will watch them for  though they do not need hatching yet if she did  not keep them clean they would be addled by living  things growing over them then as each little bag  bursts a tiny perfect octopus about the size of a flea  darts out uses his funnel at once and frolics to and  fro in the water his body blushing now with one  colour and now with another  In our seas an octopus scarcely ever has arms  more than two feet long and a body about the size  of an ordinary lemon but in the Mediterranean they  have been caught with arms four feet long and are  Yiuch dreaded by the bathers and in the British  Tuseum there is an arm of a Calamary nine feet  n length so that the creature which carried it and  which probably lived on the coasts of South America  must have been formidable indeed  But if there are ugly and dangerous headfooted  inimals there are among them two lovely forms  The Argonaut though she does not really sail on the  water with her two arms raised as sails as the poets  imagined yet forms such a lovely cradle for her eggs  which she carries with her that it makes her a thing  of beauty as she drives herself backwards through  the water The shellbearing Argonaut is the mother  for the father is like an ordinary octopus and has no  covering and indeed that which the mother carries  is not a true shell but a chalky nest built up by the  ends of two of her arms which are spread out into  broad webs and folded back over her body where  they lay down that beautiful delicate film of lime  the Argonaut shell Under this shell still keep  ing it covered with her arms she places her bunches  of eggs and stretching out the other six arms can fly  backwards through the water carrying her brood with  her or can like the cuttlefish float quietly or creep  along the bottom  But perhaps the most beautiful shell of all is that  of the Nautilus which it must be remembered is  totally different from the Argonaut shell being the  animals real home and not a mere nest The  Nautilus is different in many ways from the octopus  and the cuttle He has four breathing gills instead  of two his eyes are much less perfect than those of  the other headfooted animals he has no inkbag for  having a strong protecting shell he has less need for  it and he has no suckers on his feet He is the last  remnant of a once great family that of the huge  Ammonites and Nautiluses which we find buried in  the rocks of ages past and like many a remnant  of a once noble race living retired in their own  domain while younger and less sensitive branches  are fighting their way to eminence in the world the  nautilus creeps in the shallow waters of the Indian  Ocean or floats about when all is still but hides  himself persistently from view and has very rarely  been seen alive He builds his beautiful and refined  house chamber by chamber deserting one after  another as he grows too large for them and leaving  only a thin tube through the middle by which he is  supposed to fill the shell with air when he wishes  to float  Year after year beheld the silent toil  That spread his lustrous coil  Still as the spiral grew  He left the past years dwelling for the new  Stole with soft step its shining archway through  Built up its idle door  Stretched in his lastfound home and knew the old no more  He allows very few however to investigate his  habits wrapped in his proud reserve he lives his  solitary life and it is only after his death that his  beautiful shell with its pearly chambers is found and  brought to decorate our homes  And here we must take leave of the mantle  covered animals We have followed them though  very imperfectly from the poor patient oyster  through their gradual rise in power till we leave  them as dreaded conquerors in the sharp beaked  octopus and the terribly armed calamary We might  if we had ventured on the dangerous sea of conjecture  have started still earlier and linked their simpler forms  to those of the lower worms But till more is known  this course might have led us astray and it is safer  to content ourselves with marking how life has  gradually filled the ocean and the land with specially  fitted forms of mollusca having all a distinctive  nationality which separates them from the other  divisions of Lifes children so that the octopus the  cuttlefish and the nautilus stand as undoubtedly at  the head of one great plan of animal life as the ants  do at the head of the insects or man at the head of  the vertebrates We shall now have to hark back  again and in inquiring of the worm whence he  comes and how he lives start on a totally different  track which will lead both by land and water  through the forms of the shrimp and crab and  lobster to the aerial and fairy like insects which  form so large a portion of the life upon our globe  CHAPTER VII  THE OUTCASTS OF ANIMAL LIFE AND THE  ELASTICRINGED ANIMALS BY SEA AND BY LAND   And ever at the loom of Birth  The Mighty Mother weaves and sings  She weaves fresh robes for mangled earth  She sings fresh hopes for desperate things  KlNGSLEY  E have now traced the history of  four out of the seven divisions  of animal life and have seen how  each by taking a different road  has managed to get a footing for its  members in various nooks and spaces  in the world We must next try to  gain some idea of that small fifth  division containing the Worms in  which is shadowed forth as it were  that ringed structure which we shall  find so remarkable in the sixth and  largest division which follows But  before arriving at the true ringed  worms we must pause for a moment  to glance at that curious wandering and outcast  population of our globe which finding no shelter in  the earth or sea or air have taken up their abode  within their fellowcreatures and live upon them  Although we have as yet studied only the lowest  and by no means the most numerous of Lifes  children yet we begin to see that our earth is full  very full of life and that the creatures in it are  jostling each other and driving into dark and  dismal corners those which cannot get a living in  the open sunshine Millions serve as food for  others and millions die a speedy death from want  of space and food but we cannot expect that any  will give up their lives while they can find a means  of struggling on What way is there beyond those  which we have found already  There is still the novel device of a creature find  ing shelter by making another living being carry it  and of obtaining food by making another living  being nourish it And so we find that among the  low forms of many classes of animals there are  always some which prey upon their neighbours just  as in our great cities there are always some of the  most degraded and miserable our street Arabs and  our thieves who live on refuse and plunder  And this is true to such a large extent in the  animal world that there is probably scarcely a single  creature that does not carry many other creatures  upon or within its body  Some of these merely come to it for shelter as  for example the tiny peacrab which is constantly  found living in the shell of the horsemussel catching  its own food and being probably rather helpful than  otherwise to the mussel by leaving him the scraps  of his meal Others such as ticks and watermites  fix themselves on the bodies the one of sheep and  dogs the other of waterbeetles and sucking the  blood of their hosts find both food and shelter  And others finding no place for them at all in the  outer world burrow into the very body of their  victim and feed upon the soft parts within  Among these last the greater number are a low  race of softbodied worms whose ancestors when the  other forms of life the star fish mollusca ringed  animals and insects found new ways of gaining  their livelihood remained behind groping in the  mud and sand of rivers and seas and flapping about  by the broad margins of their flat bodies Some of  the descendants of these softbodied worms still  manage to live a free and independent life One  set called the wheelworms because of the curious  whirling appearance of their lashes as they swim  about may be seen under the microscope in almost  any stagnant water Another group with tiny red  eye specks and a trumpet shaped mouth in the  middle of their bodies live on the seashore or in  ditches and may be found as little jellylumps upon  watercresses before they have been washed An  other set known as the ribbonworms with elastic  bodies which stretch sometimes to an enormous  length are armed with a tiny dagger in the head  with which they pierce the soft bodies of animals  and suck out their juices One of these called the  longworm which looks like a dark strip of india  rubber as it lies coiled up under stones on the shore  has been known to be as much as twenty feet long  though only as broad as the blade of a penknife  These are the more fortunate of the softworms  which have found a place in the outside world but  there are others which unable to get a living in  the mud and sand were forced to work their way  into the bodies of snails caterpillars or grubs and  now make them their natural home Unpleasant  as it may be to think of these parasites yet when  we look at the question from their point of view  they are after all only doing their best to get  a living and they have many curious weapons to  help them in doing it nor do they always injure the  animal upon which they live unless they are in great  numbers  Thus for example one of the flukes a minute  flat worm shaped like a tiny flounder has a most  strange succession of changes in its life Firstly  The mother lives within the intestines of some  waterbird holding on firmly to her host by two  rows of tiny hooks round her head while her mouth  is firmly applied like a sucker secondly the eggs  are thrown out and fall into the water or moist mud  and out of them comes thirdly the embryo or  imperfect animal surrounded with lashes but it  does not long remain free for out of it again comes  a fourth form a small baglike animal which at once  seeks out a watersnail Paludind and clings to it  Nor are the transformations yet ended Within this  hanging sac which is called the nurse of the fluke  there appear fifthly a number of little tailed ani  mals like tadpoles and by and by the nurse bursts  and all these little creatures come swimming out  once more free in the water But the snail is not  rid of them either upon her or upon some other  snail like her a number of these little creatures fix  themselves and each one boring into her foot drops  off its tail and forming a transparent bag round its  body begins to grow a crown of hooklets In this  state it remains till the snail gobbled up by some  waterbird passes into its stomach and there the  gastric juice digesting the snail dissolves the bag  and at last the fluke becomes a perfect animal again  fixing itself by hooks and suckers in the same kind  of home from which its mother came  And now consider what a number of chances  occur to this animal during its short life any of which  may destroy it Their eggs are not placed in a fit  spot by a careful mother but fall wherever the bird  may chance to drop them and twice in their lives  they have to find a snail in which alone they can live  and grow Many fail and clinging to stones or  weeds die for want of their home And even if they  succeed in these first attempts the last step of all is  entirely out of their control for unless they are car  ried down the throat of the waterbird they can  never grow and lay eggs But they exist in such  myriads that this is of no consequence to the race  You can scarcely cut open any snail without finding  some of these curious creatures within it different  species living in different snails and in most cases  the worm must pass into another animal to become  complete The liverfluke of the sheep for example  which causes the rot when too abundant lives its  early life in a snail which is licked up by the sheep  as they eat the damp grass  The bladderworm however which gets into the  brain of the sheep and causes it to hang its head  belongs to another and perhaps more dangerous  tribe These are the socalled tapeworms which  can only grow to their full strength in warmblooded  animals and are armed with both hooks and suckers  on the head Now while the front part of this head  is firmly fixed buds are given off continually from  the other end making a long tail with many joints  each of which carries eggs and often has its own  separate suckers and hooks to hold firmly to its host  These creatures have no mouths or stomachs but  take in the fluid food all over their body as it passes  by them on its way through the animal they inhabit  Tapeworms wander just as flukes do thus the tape  worm of the dog begins its life in the sheep that of  the cat lives first in the mouse that of the fox in the  hare or rabbit that of the waterbird in the fish  Nor is it only flat worms which have become  parasites the little wriggling round worms live many  of them in the grubs of beetles and insects and from  these pass on into the bodies of rats and mice  squirrels and birds or fishes The little threadworm  MermiSy for example as soon as it is hatched in the  moist earth in spring time uses a sharp dagger  hidden in its head to pierce a road for itself into the  body of a grub and lives upon its juices till either  the caterpillar becomes a butterfly or is eaten or  the mermis is ready to lay her eggs and then she  pierces her way out again to lay her young in the  soft earth  Another little round worm hangs on by its suckers  inside the throat of the chicken givingit the gapes  which can be cured if the worm is brushed out with  a feather while the Trichina so dangerous in half  raw pork or ham is another round worm living in  the muscles of the pig All these and hundreds  of forms like them belong to that wandering band  of outcasts which have been driven from the face of  the earth to feed upon the strength of others They  are not a pleasant band but they teach us most  surely the truth that the children of Life are sown  broadcast over the earth to make the utmost use of  it that can be made We have even examples where  a parasite upon some animal has another parasite  within it as when by cutting open a snail worms  are found within and these worms when cut open  are found to be the home of some tiny infusorian or  slime animal so that even within the body of one  animal we have a little world of life  Another truth it teaches us which we have noticed  before namely that where a creature has little use for  its powers these diminish and it becomes degraded  and feeble for the parasitic worms with their low  structure their want of eyes and ears and often of  mouths and stomachs are most of them poor miser  able creatures at best Yet still we find even here  that each must do some work The most shiftless  of worms passed on passively from one animal to  another must find its way to the liver or the muscle  or the intestine which is its natural home and in  the hooks and suckers and daggers so admirably  fitted for opening a path and clinging firmly when  the right spot is found we see a proof that even  these poor debased parasites have acquired some  weapons in the struggle for life  But we must not stop here in our history of the  worm tribe for these parasites have distant relations  of a far higher structure who have managed to gain  a much better position in the world In each of our  groups of animal life we have found some special  advantage which has enabled them to spread their  children over the world the sponges had their  cooperative life and their protecting skeletons the  lassothrowers their poisonous weapons the prickly  skinned animals their tube feet and stony casing the  mollusca their wonderworking mantle but among  them all we have not yet met with that power of  moving quickly without which no creature is ever  very intelligent It is true that the octopus can  shoot rapidly through the water and is at the same  time the most intelligent animal we have yet learned  to know but its quick movements are all in the  water when it scrambles along the shore it is slow  and awkward while the other crawlers the sluggish  snail or the creeping starfish are not any more rapid  And yet it is clear that the power of getting quickly  over the ground must be an advantage in the struggle  for life and we shall see that it is this power and  the intelligence accompanying it which has raised  the most advanced animals in the sixth division to  such a high position as that of the bee and the ant  Nothing however is learnt in a moment and  therefore you must not be surprised that the worm  and the leech which you would probably consider  rather slow animals are the first examples of the  more active creatures Nevertheless if you could  start either of these animals on a fair race with a  snail though they might not appear to hurry yet  you would find they would beat him hollow The  accompanying picture is one given by Sir Emerson  Tennent of the landleeches as he saw them in the  low ranges of the hill country of Ceylon He tells us  that these little leeches about an inch long fixing  themselves by their tail suckers raise their heads in  the grass to watch for passers by and as soon as  they see man or beast they start off Now stretched  out at full length now drawing up the hind sucker  so as to form a loop then forward again they ad  vance at an astonishing pace till they reach their  LandLeeches of Ceylon racing to attack some creature  victim when they cling to ankle or leg or even if  these are protected are soon up at the neck where  they hang in groups like bunches of grapes as their  skins swell out with their meal  Now if we wish to learn the secret of the leech  and how he can move so fast we must look for it in two  things I st in the muscles by means of which he moves  his ringed body and 2dly in the chain of nerves  which give the order for the muscles to move He  has three layers of muscle in his skin in the first  nearest the outside the fibres run round and round  the body in rings in the second they cross each  other making a diamond shaped lattice work like a  netted purse in the third they run along the body  from head to foot When the  leech wishes to lengthen his body  he contracts the round rings and  so forces the long cords to stretch  making himself long and thin  when he wishes to shorten his  body he contracts the long cords  and forces out the rings making  himself short and stout while the  crisscross muscles help to modify  these movements  So much for the muscles and  now for the telegraph which go  verns them If you were to lay a  dead leech on its back and open it  you would see running from end  to end of its body a white cord c  with little swellings of white mat  ter g at intervals upon it and  from these swellings very fine  white threads n are seen branch  After MoqvinTandon ing out into the body The Cord  Section of a Leech to j r i j v  show the nervecord c ls made of nervethreads clinging  with the ganglia or knots closely together and is so to  TL s P eak the line of tekgaph  off from them j walls swellings are masses of nervous  of segments of the body matte r called ganglia and are the  A pockets of slime  telegraphic stations the white  threads are simple nerves carrying messages to the  muscles while round the neck of the leech is a collar  of nerves with two large ganglia the head telegraph  offices Now it is this system of nerves which enables  the leech to give orders to its muscles so rapidly  and throughout all the ringed animals this same  system is found growing more and more perfect up  to the ants  When the leech is alive and uninjured all the  telegraphic stations work together and you will notice  that in the middle of the body which is divided into  segments s each has its own station or ganglion  and though all these usually work together yet each  segment is so active that if the cord is cut in half in  the middle the stations in the tail end of the leech  will work on their own account and the two halves  will often try to pull different ways We see then  that we have here a very powerful machine and when  we remember that the leech has eight or ten simple  eyes set in its back near the head and two strong  suckers to cling with within one of which is a mouth  armed with three sawlike jaws which can easily pierce  the skin of its victim already made tight by the  sucker we can understand that he is well fitted for the  battle of life He is essentially an aquaticbreathing  animal and though he can live for some time out  of the water he can only do so in very damp air  and his body is always covered with slime which  oozes out from some little round pockets in the  sides of his body  So the leeches live in ponds and ditches and  marshes and some even on damp land and the eggs  out of which the young leeches come are laid in co  coons of gummy slime placed in the holes and clay of  the banks Fish snails limpets and grubs are their  usual food though they by no means despise warm  blooded animals when they get a chance to fasten  upon them  The elasticringed animals are not however con  fined to fresh water on the contrary though they  cannot breathe in perfectly dry air yet they have  found their way underground in the common earth  worm and there are many of them in the sea from  which probably they first came and where they are  protected and armed in many very curious ways  The common earthworm which we all know so  well is a curious example of a wateranimal adapted  to live under the earth He breathes as the leech  does and he must have moisture for perfectly dry air  is useless to him and he dies quickly in very dry  places where he cannot keep his body moistened  with slime Eyes would be of no use in his under  ground journeys and he only comes above ground  at night so we find that these organs are wanting  suckers too would be a hindrance to him and his  body ends in a fine tapering point which he can push  into the earth like a shoemakers awl  But how is he to force his way through the earth  If you pass your hand along his body from the tail  to the head you will feel a gentle resistance for  every ring bears four pair of hooked bristles pointing  backwards so fine as not to be easily seen but strong  enough for his work When he has pushed the front  part of his body a little way into the earth he then  draws it up by shortening the long muscles and the  bristles make no resistance because they point towards  the tail then he contracts his ring muscles and so  forces his body to lengthen again but this time it  cannot lengthen backwards because the bristles being  rubbed the wrong way will not yield but stick into  the earth so that the whole movement is forwards  and he makes his way  He often assists himself too in another way by  eating the earth through which he passes he has  no hard jaws like the leech but a long upper lip with  which he shovels the earth into himself sending it  out afterwards at his tail and making those curious  coils of earth which we find on lawns and garden  paths His usual food is the animal and vegetable  matter in the earth which he absorbs out of it as it  passes through his body though it is possible he may  also sometimes eat the leaves which he is so fond of  dragging with him underground leaving the stalks  sticking out above The young earthworms are  hatched underground in cocoons made of earthy mat  ter and slime and as they have no eyes or tentacles  or other tender organs they become at once fearless  miners Yet they often fall victims at all ages to  the hedgehog and the mole and even to their rela  tions the leeches if they venture near the water while  birds are their mortal enemies Even if a bird can  not succeed in catching a whole worm yet he will  often nip off his tail as he is disappearing into the  earth in the early morning after his nightly rambles  As however the worm can grow the tail again with  out any difficulty the loss is perhaps not of much  consequence and from his living underground he  is certainly exposed to fewer dangers than our next  examples the seaworms which are obliged to protect  themselves in many ingenious ways  Very few people as a rule are acquainted with  the seaworms in their homes but every one who has  handled oysters or scallops must have noticed the  curious round tubes often firmly clinging to their  shells These tubes were once the home of a sea  worm which has built them of chalk and slime The  worm itself is quite loose within the tube and stretches  its body out scrambling up the sides by the help of  its bristles and of a number of little comblike plates  which grow upon its rings If you can get a shell  covered with these tubes from the sea at low tide and  put it in salt water you will see a beautiful sight  After a time a small scarlet stopper Fig 53 will  creep up and out of the tube and as it rises on a  long stem there will follow it a splendid scarlet plume   arranged like a double fan and waving in the  water The stopper with its stem is one of the  tentacles of the worm enlarged at its end so as to  shut the animal safely within the tube while the  other tentacles have become the beautiful plume  which is the breathing apparatus of the animal It is  easy to understand that being in a tube the Serpula  as this worm is called cannot breathe through its  skin like the leech or worm and it needs these deli  cate gills to provide air for its body while at the  same time its sensitive nerves and apparatus of  muscles enable it to draw them in like lightning when  danger is near  There is an almost endless variety of these tube  building worms You can scarcely pick up a piece  of dark seaweed without finding upon it what look  like very tiny shells Sp Fig 5 3 but which are really  coiled wormtubes Again you cannot search long  among the sandy pools at low tide without finding  some long tubes made of sand and broken pieces  of shell wedged between the stones and rocks and  having forked sandy threads at their end These  tubes are the house of the Terebella or shellbinding  worm which selects particles of shell and sand with  its tentacles and places them round its soft body  cementing them together as a mason cements the  stones of a wall till it forms a tube often a foot long  so firmly wedged into the beach that it is almost  impossible to get one out perfect while you will  rarely find the worm itself as it draws back to the  farthest end of the tube directly it is alarmed  These are the fixed scaworms but there are  others as active as any animal in the sea and the  first step towards these is the common higworm which  fishermen use for bait This worm which makes the  round coils of sand we meet with on the coast moves  freely about but is not very active for it has no eyes  and lives much underground glueing together the sand  as it passes along and forming a tunnel for itself  through which it can pass Its gills are no longer round  its head as among the fixed worms but it carries them  on its back as thirteen pairs of lovely scarlet tufts  And now we come to the wonderful defensive  weapons which life has bestowed upon these wander  ing worms The lugworm safely hidden in its tunnel  does not need any but the lovely Nereis N Fig  54 which has a well developed head with eyes  tentacles and sharp jaws leads a much more active  and precarious life It hides under stones and shells  or moves about rapidly in the water and can use  its bristles not only as oars to swim with but also as  swords sabres and hooks For these fine bristles  are not simple hairs as they appear but have sawlike  edges and hooked tips and are really formidable  weapons both of attack and defence although the  smaller specimens of the creature which you find on  the shore often look like mere threads unless seen  under a magnifying glass  But if the Nereis is beautiful and terrible how  much more so is the marvellous seamouse A Fig  54 which we sometimes see thrown up on the shore  while small ones may be found by turning up stones  on the sand No one would believe at first sight  that this creature is a worm covered as it is with  broad scales and bristling with tufts of hair Yet if  you lift the scales and brush aside a thick coating of  felt which covers the body or if you look underneath  the creature as it crawls along you will be able to dis  tinguish the rings and also to see that the tufts of hair  spring each from a separate ring like the hairs of the  earthworm The broad scales are a curious breathing  arrangement peculiar to the seamouse for when they  are lifted the thick coating of felt is filled with water  which in this way flows all over the outside of the  body and when they are shut they force it out again  making room for a fresh supply of water to pour in  when they rise In this way the whole body of the  animal is bathed in water out of which the oxygen  can be taken through the delicate skin  But it is above all the tufts of hair which are so  beautiful and wonderful beautiful because each  bristle being marked with the finest possible  scratches reflects light of all the colours of the rain  bow crimson scarlet orange yellow green blue  and lilac according to the angle at which the light  falls upon it so that the creature looks as if it carried  a forest of prisms upon its back Wonderful because  each of these hairs is a sharp lance by which the  worm can protect itself from attack In one of the  seamice the Aphrodite hispida these bristles are per  fect harpoons with barbed points at their tip and  delicate teeth all along the edges and they can be  thrust out when the animal wishes to defend itself  But how then can the worm avoid cutting itself  with these sharp instruments To prevent this each  barbed spine has a smooth horny sheath which closes  upon it as it is drawn in and prevents it from tearing  the tender flesh Such a creature as this deserves  indeed to be called the king of worms being at the  same time so beautiful and so formidably armed  He lives in deep water and is only to be found  when thrown on shore where he is very helpless  though in his own element he is a dangerous neigh  bour as he feeds greedily upon all living animals  not sparing even his own brothers when they are  weaker than himself He is a timid creature hiding  under stones and in dark corners and shunning the  light of day which gives him all his beauty yet in  bidding adieu to the wormtribe we must acknow  ledge that none of them can compare either in deli  cacy of structure or in their weapons of attack and  defence with the little seamouse or as he is often  called the porcupine of the ocean  CHAPTER VIII  THE MAILED WARRIORS OF THE SEA WITH RINGED  BODIES AND JOINTED FEET   Strong suits of armour round their bodies close  Which like thick anvils blunt the force of blows  In wheeling marches formd oblique they go  With harpy claws their limbs are armed below  Fell shears the passage to their mouth command  From out their flesh their bones by nature stand  Broad spread their backs their shining shoulders rise  Unnumberd joints distort their lengthened thighs  With stony gloves their hands are firmly cased  Their round black eyeballs in their bosom placed  On eight long feet the wondrous warriors tread  And either end alike appears a head  These mortal wits to name as Crabs agree  The gods have other names for things than we  BATTLE OF THE FROGS AND MlCE  W  AVING now arrived at the sixth  and largest division of the whole  animal kingdom we are going to  leave behind us those low and  scattered tribes which live as it  were in a dreamy unconscious  way tossed hither and hither by  outward circumstances and having  but feeble nerves to guide them  and for the future shall have to do  with beings gradually struggling  into active intelligent life  No one can watch the beautiful  transparent prawn with his bright  eyes gleaming and his antennae  trembling in the water without feeling that we have  here a creature much more alive to everything around  him than the groping starfish or the creeping worm  while the active little crab as he peers out from the  seaweed and scrambles across the shallow pools or  buries himself in an instant in the wet sand shows  a lightness and agility which we look for in vain in  the sluggish snail or the slowly grazing limpet  And when we learn that the prawn and the crab in  the sea are formed on the same plan as the centipedes  spiders and insects of the land we see that we are  on the road to even more intelligent and more active  creatures such as the busy bee and the thrifty ant  But how can this be that the heavy armourcovered  crab and lobster which are called Crustacea from their  hard crustlike shells should belong to the same type  as the delicate hovering butterfly and the buzzing  gnat Let us pause and master this for till we  have done so we cannot understand the wonderful  way in which the creatures of each group in this divi  sion have been adapted to the life they have to lead  In Fig 55 we have four animals a prawn a  centipede a spider and a caterpillar together with  the butterfly into which it turns Now all these  animals wear their skeleton or the hard part of their  bodies not inside as we do with soft flesh growing  over it but outside so that if you grasp any of them  when dead the skin as we should call it will bend  or crack like a piece of thin horn Moreover this  hard outside skeleton is arranged more or less in  rings with softer skin between them as you may see  in the centipede and caterpillar and in the hind part  of the prawn and butterfly and they are to be traced  in many spiders though as a rule they have disap  peared These rings remind us of the worm only  that in the animals of which we are now speaking  they are more marked and whereas the worm has  only hairs for legs these animals have manyjointed  limbs which are of great use in running leaping  and seizing prey It is because of these jointed  limbs that the Crustacea centipedes spiders and  insects are all called Arthropoda or jointed footed  animals Linnaeus called them all Insects because  their bodies are cut into divisions in into secta cut  and although naturalists now generally confine the  word insect to those which have wings and six  legs yet a good English name is so much wanted  which will take in centipedes and spiders as well as  beetles and butterflies that I shall follow Mr Ray  Lankesters suggestion and call all the ringed and  jointedfooted animals Insects  In this sense the prawns and their relations which  are both jointedfooted and cut into parts have been  called the Insects of the Sea and this name helps  to remind us how much they are like the great body  of insects on the land  This likeness is very evident when we compare  the four types in Fig 5 5 Thus we have first the  butterfly whose body you will notice is cut into three  distinct parts the head with one pair of feelers or  antenna on its forehead a pair of eyes on the side of  the head and mouthjaws below the thorax or chest  on which grow the six legs and two pair of wings  and the abdomen or hinder part of the body which  never possesses any limbs The butterfly thus is a  sixlegged winged insect Then we have the centi  pede whose ringed body reminds us of the caterpillar  from which the butterfly springs but which has  jointed feet on every ring Next we come to the  spider and here we find the head and shoulders  joined into one strong piece and bearing four pair of  legs while the abdomen has nearly lost the traces  of rings The antennae are bent down over the  forehead and have been turned as we shall presently  see into pincers hooks and poison fangs while the  short feelers in front of the head which look like  antennae are really a part of the mouth Lastly we  have the prawn with his head and shoulders joined  into one like the spider in the lobster you may see  a curved line marking the spot where these are  joined with five pair of legs while some of its rela  tions have many more and the usual ringed abdo  men which in this case has little paddles under it  for swimming  Now just as when we feed part of our food goes  to make phosphates which form and strengthen our  bones or internal skeleton so do all these animals  make out of the food in their bodies a substance  called cJdtine something like horn and this is  deposited in the outer layer of their skin and  makes a firm skeleton all over the body and eyes  and antennae and legs and within this firm skele  ton the soft animal lives much as a soldier in olden  times was enclosed in his jointed armour But if a  soldier had been placed in armour as a baby he  would have had to change his suit many times before  he became a man and this is also the case with  insects Their covering is not like that of the sea  urchin which we saw could be added to at every  point it is made once for all like the soldiers  armour and the creature must throw it off when it  becomes too small for its body Thus the prawn the  centipede the spider and the caterpillar alike creep  out of their armour many times in their lives leaving  it often standing so perfect that it looks like the  creature itself  We see then that the prawn and his relations  although they live in the sea belong to the ringed  and jointedfooted division and are formed on the  same plan as the landinsects which have spread so  far and wide over the globe These are an active busy  multitude which if they could think and speak would  have far more right to call this earth their world than  we have to call it ours for whether in the sea or in  the rivers and ponds in the fields forests or marshes  at the tops of mountains or in underground caves  and passages in our gardens our cellars our houses  or about our persons anywhere everywhere all over  the world their hosts are to be found  We are accustomed to attach great importance to  the backboned animals the fishes reptiles birds lions  elephants and monkeys because they are compara  tively large and conspicuous but in truth if we ex  cept the human race they are as nothing either in  number or in activity and ingenuity as compared with  the insects and their allies  If we could take one of each species of all the  backboned animals and add to them all the species  of worms mollusca pricklyskinned animals lasso  throwers sponges and lime and flint builders all  these together would only make up 50000 species  or onefifth of the animals on the globe the other  fourfifths or 200000 species belong to the ringed and  jointedfooted animals and of these I 5 0000 are the  sixlegged insects Now we have learnt that if crea  tures succeed in the battle of life it is because they  can hold their own and fight bravely and therefore  we are prepared to find that life has taught these her  active children many new lessons and armed them  with many useful tools and weapons differing greatly  according to the lives they have to lead  And first of all we must turn our attention to the  great group of Crustacea the insects of the sea  For though some of this group as the waterflea and  crayfish live in rivers and ponds while a few such  as the woodlouse and even some kinds of crabs  crawl upon the land yet the chief home of the crus  tacea is the ocean where having scarcely any enemies  so powerful as themselves except their own relations  they run riot both as to numbers and size Think  for a moment of the multitudes of sandhoppers to be  seen leaping on a dry sandy shore in the evening  or which rise like a cloud of dust out of the half  rotten seaweed if you stir it with your hand Try  to reckon up the myriads of shrimps and prawns  which must be caught daily to supply all England  and which are nothing to those that remain behind  Look at the large crabs and lobsters in the fish  mongers shops and think that in London alone  25000 lobsters are often sold in the season in one  single day Then call to mind how you cannot  walk a step on the shore at low tide without seeing  some tiny crab scuttling along in a hurry to catch  something or to escape being caught himself or  how constantly you come across a hermit crab with  a periwinkle or whelk shell on his back making  tracks in the sand as he wanders along Try and  count some day the number of acorn shells Fig 61  p 174 which grow on one single piece of rock or  the groyne of a pier For these too are crustaceans  as are also the barnacles Fig 61 which hang from  floating timber or gather on the bottom of ships  When you have gained some idea of the multitudes  of these creatures on our own shores you will not  have reckoned one millionth part of the crustaceans  which live in the sea for not only are there strange  forms of all kinds on distant shores but there are  oceanic crabs which swim in the open sea for days  without resting just as the albatross flies over it  while smaller crustaceans swarm under the ice in  the Arctic regions and there is scarcely a fish which  has not an animal of this class living on some part  of its body  Of all the many forms however there is probably  not one more beautiful than the delicate transparent  prawn as he paddles along lazily in sea pools or  through the still water of an aquarium His horny  Fig s6 skeleton is so clear  and glasslike that it  looks like crystal while  the formidable toothed  saw protectinghis head  is scarcely visible in  the water and his  delicate antennae and  tapering limbs look as  Common Prawn r  if they would snap at  a Large antennae a 2 antennules or  small antenna b front leg with small a touch AS he SWims  claw bearing a brush t carapace you will notice that it  j i u u u 2 i is not his ten true lesrs  ringed abdomen S swimmerets t in the front part of his  body which row him  along but the little hairy swimmerets S which lie under  the hinder part or abdomen while if anything alarms  him he darts rapidly backwards by a smart stroke  of his fanlike tail t His long antennae or feelers a  are streaming over his back while a pair of shorter  antennae or antennules a 2 as these are called each  bearing three branches move gently to and fro in  the water Why do they do this Because in their  last joint where they touch the head is a little bag  beset with hair and having in it a thick fluid and  some tiny particles of sand and this is the ear of the  prawn from which a nerve passes to the main nerve  mass in his head so that as he moves the antennules  in the water he is as it were listening without ceasing  to all sounds that may pass through it Just above  these hearing organs a pair of gleaming eyes stand  out upon short stalks and if you examine these  under the microscope you will see that they are  composed of a number of sixsided facets arranged  in a hemisphere so that the prawn can keep a sharp  lookout on all sides Here then we have an animal  with a keen power of sight of hearing and of feel  ing and if you have ever watched a prawn hunting  over the scent of a piece of meat which has been  dropped into an aquarium you will not doubt that  he has also the sense of smell though it is difficult  to point out exactly where the smelling organ is  And now suppose that he has scented or caught  sight of his prey whether it be a piece of dead  flesh or a soft tender living shrimp he darts down  upon it and seizing it with his second pair of feet  cl Fig 56 which have large pincers picks it to  pieces with his mouth and claws and eats it much  as a child eats a biscuit held in its hand but not  with the same kind of mouth If you will get hold  of a prawn and try to make out its jaws you will  be terribly puzzled with the number of pieces in  them for you will find no less than six pairs The  outer pair are evidently altered feet which are folded  right over the others so as to cover them in safely  much as you might put your hands before your  mouth under these lie two more pairs with little feelers  attached to them under these again are two other  pairs rather differently shaped and lastly under these  a stout pair of jaws with sharp edges for biting and  a surface for grinding the food These jaws do not  work up and down as ours do but from side to side  like the jaws of a bee or ant and they are most use  ful to the prawn in tearing its food  But how can he have come by so many Let us  look back for a minute to the worm which you will  remember had no true head but only a long upper  lip and a line of rings on its body each bearing its  own pair of bristles Now the prawn also is a ringed  animal only that in his head the separation between  the rings is lost and in his thorax they have grown  closely together so that we can only count them by  the lines under his body and by the limbs which grow  one pair to each ring Thus wherever there has been  a ring there a pair of jointed limbs remains altered to  suit the wants of the animal and as the head is made  up of many rings these come close together and  form the eyestalks the antennae antennules and the  mouthpieces while the five rings of the thorax bear  the five pair of jointed legs and the swimmerets and  tailpieces spring from the rings of the abdomen  While all the Crustacea keep to this rule of a  pair of jointed limbs to each ring the changes are  endless by which these rings and these limbs have  been modified to suit their lives Thus for example  while the prawn uses his second pair of feet for  catching and holding his prey it is the front feet of  the crab and lobster which carry the large strong  claws and in the shrimp these front feet have a kind  of broad hand at the end with a hook attached  Again the skeleton of the prawn remains clear and  transparent but the warlike crab and lobster secrete  layers of lime in their skeleton forming a stony coat  Then again if you look at the nimble sandhopper  T Fig 5 7 with eyes flat in its head instead of being  raised on stalks you will notice that all its body is  ringed right up to its head so that it can bend itself  almost into a circle and flinging back its tail with a  jerk spring about in the sand  In the skeleton shrimp C Fig 57 which crawls  about among the weeds under water the body has  become so thin that it looks like a mere chain of bony  rings with legs hanging on to them In this curious  shrimp I want you particularly to notice the little  baglike flaps g hanging down where the legs join  the body These are its breathing gills in which the  colourless blood of the veins takes up oxygen as they  lie bathed in the water Now when you next eat a  prawn or shrimp lift up the shield or carapace c Fig  56 covering the thorax and you will find a row of  curious bodies b Fig 58 looking something like  curled feathers lying against its sides and fastened  to the legs These are the breathing gills of the  prawn and they will remind you of the ladies  fingers which we clear away in a lobster before  eating it Though both in the lobster and prawn the  shield has grown over and covered these gills yet  you will see that they are really on the outside of  the body at the top of the legs as in the skeleton  shrimp and that water can easily get to them under  the shield In the oyster you will remember that  hairs or cilia swept the water over the gills see p 1 09  but here by a most beautiful arrangement too com  plicated to explain the movement of the feet near  the mouth empties the water out and so draws in  fresh constantly from the back And here again  notice that animals without backbones do not breathe  through their mouths but through their sides  Meanwhile our prawn has been swimming and  feeding and you will scarcely wonder at his activity  or his quick senses when you learn that the same  double chain of nerves which we saw in the leech  runs also under his body g Fig 58 only that  whenever two rings are quite lost in each other two  nerve masses or telegraph stations are also joined  into one so that in the head for example a large  number have come together and make powerful  headstations Jig Fig 58 of nervous power His  muscles too are firm and strong and fill nearly the  whole of his ringed abdomen and of his legs and  claws so that though he looks so transparent and  fairylike he is stronger than he appears  But now there comes a time when he grows  restless and uneasy and ceases to care for food as he  wanders about the rocks on the tips of his toes seem  ing rather to be seeking some particular spot The  fact is that it is nearly a fortnight since he has changed  his armour and as he is young and growing fast it  begins to be very tight for him At last he finds  a spot to his liking and taking hold firmly by his  feet he begins to sway to and fro so as to loosen his  body inside its covering Then all at once a slit  opens between his shield and the skin of his abdomen  and gradually his shoulders and head back out bring  ing with them antennae and eyestalks legs and feet  as perfect as before and having even their tiny spines  and hairs upon them then with a sudden jerk he  pulls out his abdomen and leaves his clear transparent  shell so perfect with the coverings of the eyes anten  nas legs hairs and spines nay even with the lining  of his stomach and digestive tube that you might  believe the real prawn still stood upon the rock  But no the creature himself is rolling helplessly  over his soft body being scarcely able to keep itself  in position and if any animal were to seize him now  his deathhour would have arrived He knows this  well and soon begins to strike out his abdomen and  work his swimmerets which are gradually stiffening  and strengthening and so manages to swim or creep  into some sheltered nook where his inner coat which  has long been forming hardens and he is a valiant  prawn again  He is now quite clean and bright and beautiful  and he loves to remain so and is most particular  about his toilet in fact the prawn is one of the few  Crustacea which has been seen to brush himself up  with great care though probably many others do it  We have noticed that his strongest claws are not  on the front pair of feet as in the crab and lobster  but on the second pair The front claws are fine  and delicate and carry little brushes on their tips  and the prawn has been seen standing on his four  hinder pair of legs with his tail tucked under him  and using his front pair to brush his swimmerets  afterwards passing them through his footjaws to  clear the dirt off the brushes  Not so the large crabs the backs of which we  so often find covered with weed and shells and small  tubeworms which have settled upon them so that  when a crab is old and does not change his shell  he often carries a perfect colony of life about with  him If the prawn is the crystal fairy of the sea  surely the crab when big is the lumbering armed  giant who destroys and devours without mercy  glaring out of his coat of mail and not fearing any  creature except a stronger crab than himself He  spares no animal whether fish mollusc crustacean  or worm that comes in his way as he sidles along  on his strong muscular limbs but seizing them in  his powerful claws he cracks their shells if they have  any and tears their flesh to pieces tucking it greedily  into his mouth which looks as if it were in the  middle of his body He even makes no difficulty of  breaking the shell of one of his own kind and feeding  upon it from behind while it in its turn is eating  some smaller and weaker brother  To devour and be devoured seems to be the main  mission of crabs and they feed so greedily that we  shall not be surprised to learn that besides their  array of outer jaws they and many of the other  Crustacea have hard teeth in their stomach j Fig  58 which help to grind down the food You may  see these teeth well in the stomach of the lobster  where children often call them the lady in her  chair  At first sight it is difficult to understand how a  crab can belong to the ringed animals but if you  lift up the tail which is tucked under the body  you will see that this is ringed like the abdomen of  the prawn and if you break off the legs carefully  you will find under them the fingerlike gills showing  that the body of the crab answers to the head and  thorax of the prawn only that the shield over its  back is much broader and is fastened down firmly  at the sides while the tail is tucked under instead of  standing out  Moreover if you could see the crab when he is  first hatched from the egg i Fig 59 you would see  his tail stretched out and jointed as distinctly as that  of the prawn and at this time with his flat eyes and a  curious spine sticking out of his back he is as unlike  a crab as can well be In this state he swims about  vigorously and in seven or eight days having cast  off his coat several times he loses his spine his back  becomes broader and he becomes a tailed crab 2  Still he goes on swimming and clinging to seaweed  or anything he can find till after moulting a few  more times his tail is folded under and he sinks to  the bottom a true walking crab 3  A change or metamorphosis of this kind takes  place in nearly all the Crustacea during their growth  though it is different in the various forms  After the crab has assumed his real shape he  lives on the bottom of the sea generally in deep  water and in the holes of the rocks and fights  bravely for his life among his companions Only  about four times in the year while he is young a  season of fear and anxiety comes upon him for his  shell will not allow him to grow any larger and he  must part with his strong armour Then he creeps  into the darkest hole he can find and throwing him  self upon his back swells out his body till he forces  his covering shield to break away from the under  part and so he creeps out He does this with much  pain and difficulty for his claws are much larger than  the joints through which they have to be pulled and  they are often cut and lacerated in the process  He could not in fact get out at all if it were not  that his flesh becomes watery before he casts his  shell Every housekeeper knows and avoids buying  a watery crab in which the flesh is poor and thin  and the shell is half filled with fluid When his  shell is cast the crab waits trembling in his hole for  a new layer of lime to form before he can venture  boldly out again It is said that at these times  when a mother crab loses her shell and becomes soft  her mate will watch the hole where she is lying and  keep her safe till her shell has hardened  But how then is it with the hermitcrab He  poor fellow never loses the long tail which all young  crabs have when they are born and moreover the skin  which covers his abdomen is quite soft thus always  offering a tempting morsel to hungry sea animals  One would think that here was a disadvantage very  unfair to the half naked animal But wait a mo  ment and consider how many thousands of hermit  crabs of all sizes feed on the dead fish and garbage  of every seashore and how well they are protected  by the strong winkle and whelk shells which they  choose for their houses so that they can hold their  own when the tiny crabs wearing only their own  brittle coats would soon be cracked and eaten  Evidently the hermitcrab has found stolen houses  an advantage to him and the way in which his tail  has become adapted to his home while keeping all  the usual parts of a crab is most curious  One of his claws c i is much bigger than the  other and closes the opening of the shell after the  rest of the body is drawn in thus barring the door  against most intruders although the fiddler crab  sometimes manages to thrust in his thin pincers and  pinch the hermit to death His next two feet are  strong though pointed and are able to take a firm  hold on the sand as he walks and to bear the weight  of the shell while the two comparatively thin pairs  which follow serve to shift his body in its house His  swimmerets no longer needed are stunted and small  and his soft abdomen follows the winding of the shell  in which he lives while the tail fin no longer broad  and flat is turned into a kind of grappling hook  which takes hold so firmly that he is scarcely ever  dragged out alive So there is but little danger for  him except when he is changing his shell for a larger  one and this he does wonderfully quickly never  leaving his old house till he has found a new one  In fact the hermit succeeds so well in life that he is  extremely pugnacious and will soon make great  havoc in an aquarium Moreover he often feeds two  other animals besides himself for a parasitic anemone  often lives upon his shell and a beautiful worm 55  shelters within it and has been seen to tear the food  out of the crabs mouth  So each in their several ways the prawns lobsters  and crabs struggle for their livelihood Brave hardy  and voracious they spare scarcely any creature of the  sea of moderate size whether dead or living and  they fight so madly that fishermen sending lobsters  alive to London are obliged to run a piece of wood  in the joints of the claws to prevent them from  maiming each other on the road  They care but little for lost limbs for these will  grow again and when wounded so that they might  bleed to death they throw off the shattered limb  at the next joint where a new skin quickly forms  and the danger is averted No doubt hundreds die  both in youth and age yet the multitudes never  diminish for one lobster alone will produce 20000  eggs which she will carry patiently for six months  under her abdomen fastened together by gluey  threads Even after she has broken open the eggs  by the movement of her tail and released the baby  lobsters she will still carry them till their coat is  hard and firm and only then leave them to wander  alone The crab and the prawn on the contrary  turn their little ones out at once to swim as scarcely  visible specks in the open sea where they feed and  grow till their strange changes of shape are worked  out  The crab family however are not satisfied with  one kind of life the velvet fiddlercrab of our shores  has its hind feet broad and flat and may be seen  swimming when the common crab can only creep  while the oceanic crab has taken to the open sea  and can swim for days without resting feeding the  while Then on the other hand there are crabs  living on the land The racing crab of Ceylon  which will outstrip the swiftest runner burrows in  the dry sand and though it likes to have its gills  moist dies if held under water The frogcrab of  the Indian ocean climbs on the roofs of houses  the robber crab of the Mauritius lives in holes lined  with cocoanut fibre at the roots of the cocoanut  palm and breaking open the nuts feeds upon the  fruit while the landcrab of the West Indies burrows  in the ground and goes only once a year to the sea  to lay her eggs Still all these crabs retain enough  of their old habits to like to have their breathing  gills wet and most of them visit water daily for this  purpose while some of them have a curious way of  keeping the water enclosed and freshening it with  air while others use the water till it is exhausted  and then raise their shield or carapace and breathe  as land animals  And now after hearing of these land crabs we  shall not find it so difficult to believe that the little  woodlouse of our gardens which curls itself up like  a ball and is the only form we have remaining like  the huge trilobites of ages gone by is a true crus  tacean adapted for breathing air though still loving  moist places  But we must return to the sea where a most  curious and interesting group still remains for us to  study We have heard of old families among men  who having met with misfortune have had the good  sense to set to work and earn their daily bread in  quiet obscurity and among the lower animals we  have seen that  Fig 6 1   many like the  sponge and oy  ster give up the  free roving life of  their childhood  and settle down  upon one spot  But who ever be  fore heard of a  creature which  after swimming  about in a ra  tional manner  with an eye or  eyes to see with  and antennae to  feel with behav  ing like an ordi  nary and respect  able individual  should put its  forehead down to  a rock and ce  ment it there by  means of glue from its antennae and should remain  thus all the rest of its life with its head downwards and  its heels in the air kicking its food into its mouth Yet this is the true history of the barnacles and  acorn barnacles of our coasts and nothing can  explain such extraordinary behaviour except the  overcrowding of the sea and the struggle for life  which drove these curious creatures to prefer feeding  upside down in places where others left room for  them to starving in an upright position  It is worth while to spend a short time sitting  by a seaside pool or on the steps of a pier to watch  the animals within the white shelly cones called  acornshells Fig 61 foreground feeding in the sea  water Each little cone is made of a number of  shelly pieces and in the middle of these you will see  from time to time two valves v open through which  a tuft of feathery transparent fingers c is thrust out  looking like a curl of delicate hair Then after  opening out in the water the curl is drawn up again  just as you are beginning to admire it and the valves  close Not for long however for almost imme  diately they open again and the same process is re  peated so that in a group of acorn barnacles all is  in motion as one after another sweeps the sea for  food  These tufts are in fact the fringed legs of the  balanus as the creature is called and looking at  him as he is fastened down inside the shell you will  see that he is something like a rough attempt at a  shrimp lying on its back mouth uppermost so as to  be able to seize and devour the minute creatures of  the sea drawn in by the fringes of the legs  In this way safely ensconced in his jointed shelly  carapace of carbonate of lime it is easy to see that  the balanus lives more securely than if he had re  mained a freely roving creature as we see him at  port  And here we must take leave of the Crustacea  We have really only made acquaintance with three  branches 1st the tenfooted and stalkeyed crus  taceans the prawns and crabs 2d those with eyes  fixed in the shell and breathinggills fixed to the legs  the sandhoppers and skeleton shrimps and 3d the  barnacles But these by no means represent even  the chief forms The Kingcrab of the Moluccas  with his horseshoe carapace and spiked tail repre  sents a whole race which flourished long before the  coalforests grew The beautiful little fairyshrimpsf  of our ponds are another type whose feet are used as  breathinggills while the tiny waterflea J and cypris  of our ponds are true crustaceans though they have  twovalved shells like a scallop  The histories of these little beings are as yet not  much known and in truth it is impossible to follow  out all the strange vagaries of the Crustacea with  out making them a life study Even when we have  exhausted those which live independent lives there  remains a whole mass of parasites which fix them  selves on the backs and in the gills of fishes and  even under the tails of their distant relations the  crabs and lobsters  Thus we find that these insects of the sea  have spread everywhere where there is water and  have even found their way on to the land Yet  they are scarcely likely ever to make much way on  dry ground for we have seen that they have always  a lingering tendency to breathe water and therefore  they are at a disadvantage among the myriads of  insects fitted for the air Meanwhile though we  may know more of the habits of the spider and ant  than of the crabs and the barnacles which hide from  us in the ocean yet those who love to study compli  cated family history will find no class in the animal  kingdom with such an interesting and involved  genealogy as that of the Crustacea or crustcovered  animals  CHAPTER IX  THE SNAREWEAVERS AND THEIR HUNTING  RELATIONS  So dangles oer the brook depending low  The spider artist till propitious breeze  Buoy her athwart the stream From shore to shore  She fastens then her horizontal thread  Sufficient bridge and traversing alert  Her finespun radii flings from side to side  Shapes her concentric circles without art  And all accomplished couches in the midst  Herself the centre of her flimsy toils  HURDIS  T was a hot spring night on  the coast of the Mediterranean in  the south of France and the hum  of the night insects filled the air  The nightbeetles were flying hither  and thither and the crickets on the  terraces of the olive groves were  loudly chirping their lovesongs  One in particular whose dark brown  body could scarcely be distinguished  against the bank even by nocturnal  enemies was working his wingcases  with a will and sending out a clear  and piercing cry He little thought  that he was sounding his own deathnote but so it was  for behind him from under a large stone in a damp  corner in the side of the bank an enemy was stealthily  approaching  Any one who had been lately studying prawns and  lobsters in the sea on this same shore would almost  have fancied that this enemy was a curious small lob  ster which had come upon the land for two large  claws were stretched on each side of his head and  with them he felt his way as he crawled along his  jointed feet were cased in horny armour and so was  his whole body which had a shield over the head  and shoulders as a prawn has while his tail which  dragged heavily behind him was covered with the  same kind of horny rings Two large eyes with  some smaller ones near them shone in the front of  his head and he was slowly but surely advancing  upon the unconscious cricket And now he was  close upoji him and in a second almost too quickly  for the movement to be seen the long claws were  thrown forward and the cricket was seized and held  up in the air But our friend had no intention of  yielding so easily he was strong and he struggled  violently in vain for his captor briskly curled up  the long tail which had till now seemed such a  burden to him and from the tip of it thrust a  poisoned dart into the body of his victim So the  sturdy cricket died in the grasp of the Scorpion  Nor was his captor long in devouring his prey  Bringing the cricket down to his mouth he pierced  his skin with the sharp pincers p Fig 63 which  take the place of antennae on his head and soon  sucked out the juices of his body then dropping the  empty skin he went dragging slowly on his way in  search either of fresh food or to find some mate  wandering like himself  Plenty of these fierce little Scorpions which hide  under stones by day and come out by night may be  found in the warm sunny south and though they  look so like crustaceans they are true land animals  They have no means of spinning and have a poison  dart in the tail quite peculiar to themselves yet they  belong to the spider family as may be seen by their  eight pairs of legs their sharp pincers which take the  place of the antennae of insects their claws which  are part of their mouthpieces and are fixed to the  jaws and the narrow slits under the abdomen  through which they take in air to breathe They  lead but a lonely life for whether in the sandy  plains of Africa where they are often as much as a  foot long or in the burning heat of South America  or on the warm bright shores of Italy each scorpion  burrows under his own protecting stone rarely having  any other with him Even in summer it is only  at night that they seek companionship while in the  winter they burrow deep in the ground and sleep  till the warmth comes round again  While the spider is the industrious and skilful  snareweaver of its class the scorpion is the fierce  bandit knowing well the power of its sting and the  terror it inspires and like the bandit it lives in a  state of perpetual warfare flinging its tail over its  head and extending its claws at the least alarm and  either fighting till death or running rapidly back  wards facing its foe till it reaches a place of safety  And in like manner as the robbers wife shut out from  the companionship of the rest of womankind will  love and defend her children with wild devotion so  the female scorpion will carry her young brood for  many weeks after they are born clustering all over  her back till they are able to fight for themselves  We must not however pause long over these  solitary and dangerous creatures for a far more  interesting group of the spider class flourishes here  in our own country where all who wish may study  its members  Instead therefore of lingering in the warm south  let us return to England where in the cracks of  some old paling or under the leaves of a shrub on a  summers evening after some days of thunder and  rain we may find a common garden spider lying  crumpled up as if half dead Her web long ago  destroyed by the wind and the rain has left her no  means of getting food for many long hours and she  is waiting patiently till the weather will allow her to  spin fresh snares How mean and shrivelled and  helpless she looks any one will know who has ever  found a spider in this deplorable condition and cer  tainly no one at first sight would imagine that this  crumpled looking object could have the ingenuity  and skill to weave the web which a few hours later  will be stretched across the bushes And yet as set  free from your hand she hurries away scrambling  over the ground in the twinkling of an eye or  dropping nimbly by means of her almost invisible  thread there can be no doubt that she is both active  and intelligent and a little patient examination will  show that the poor despised spider which for some  unknown reason is so often disliked by mankind is  one of the most industrious and cleanly skilful and  patient of lifes children while she carries upon her  body some of the most curious implements ever de  vised for doing her work in the world  Look at her limbs in their jointed casings Fig 64  and you will see that here is the same outside horny  skeleton as in the prawn and the scorpion with  elastic skin between the joints but her abdomen a  has almost entirely lost the traces of rings and is  often covered with fine down while her head and  shoulders welded like theirs into one piece t are  sturdy and strong giving her great advantage in  attacking and devouring the numerous insects which  fall victims to her bloodthirsty appetite  Perhaps you will think at first that she has  antennae for two short feelers p p Fig 64 stand  out in front of her head But these like the claws  of the scorpion are part of her jaws and are  fastened on to them None of the spider family have  any true antennae In the scorpion we found them  turned into pincers p t Fig 63 in the spider they  have become most dangerous and powerful fangs i  and 72 Fig 64 which hang down over her mouth  and while the scorpion carries her poison in her tail  the spider bears it in her head and as we shall pre  sently see pours it into her victim through these  pointed weapons  But now while we are talking of her our friend  the spider is beginning to grow restless for as even  ing draws on and the temperature of the air and  other signs promise a fine night she is anxious to  spin a new web so as not to go supperless to bed  Have you any idea how she does this for she has  nothing but her own body both to supply the  material and the machinery for the work  Look carefully under her abdomen and near the  tip you will find six little nipples s looking some  thing like miniature copies of the teats of a cow  Under these nipples inside her body there are special  glands in which a kind of gum is secreted and this  dries when it comes into the air and forms the silken  thread from which the spider hangs and out of which  she forms her web And now comes the almost  incredible part of the story These nipples which  are called spinnerets have not merely one opening  like a cows teat but each one tiny as it is is pierced  with at least a hundred holes and when the spider  begins her web more than six hundred separate  strands go to make the one slender thread which  you see stretched out from her body The four  spinnerets nearest the tail give out the long threads  the two above moving from side to side weave the  whole into one connected line Nor is this all for  the spider can close any of the holes at will and a  fine or a coarse a dry or a spangled thread comes  from her body according to the use she wishes to  make of it  But when the thread is made how is it to be  drawn out and guided on its way Under the  microscope her feet are seen to be formed of three  claws the middle one longer and bent so as to grasp  the threads as she runs and the other two toothed  liked combs With these combs and the spines  and hairs upon her legs she manipulates the tender  thread as it oozes from her body and does with it  what she will  And now let us watch her at her work Running  hither and thither she first selects a spot c to start  from and pressing her spinnerets against it leaves  there a little lump of sticky silk Then standing  quite still she gives out from her spinnerets a light  floating thread Longer and longer it grows and  floats in the evening air and by and by the end  catches on some bush let us say at the point d  Instantly the spider feels the pull and fastening the  end out of her own body to the sticky lump c she  runs along the line c d strengthening it with silk as  she goes That line being firm she can use it as her  tightrope and running from bush to bush may either  let fresh threads float or carry them with her from  point to point till she has made a square or triangle  of threads c d e f anchored here and there to  the leaves and stems And now she must make  the cross lines so going to the middle a of the  highest line she drops down and swinging to and fro  catches the lower line and stretches a vertical  cord a 8  Then she is ready to begin the web Up to this  time she has been obliged to work slowly and with  many difficulties but from this moment the work  goes on apace Running to the middle of the line  a b she fixes her thread there and then goes on to  the other side carrying the line with her and keeping  it carefully with her feet from clinging to the one on  which she runs Arrived at the stretched line she  fastens this loose thread to it at I and so makes one  of the spokes of the wheel Then moving a little  farther along she fixes another end at 2 and running  back to the centre forms another spoke and so on  through 3 4 etc till all the spokes are made  Then she goes back to the middle and walking care  fully round and round the spokes lays down a  winding thread from the centre to the outside fixing  it to each of the spokes by a minute drop of gum  At first this thread is dry and hard but when the  spider is at a short distance from the centre she  changes her material and gives out a beautiful fine  thread spangled at every point with minute drops of  gum which will not harden in the air so that by  the time she has reached the end of the spokes she  has left behind her a glorious spangled web closely  woven and wonderfully elastic because the drops of  gum yield gently as the web sways while they are  so sticky that no insect flying against the web is  likely to get away again  In this manner in about threequarters of an  hour the nimble little spider has woven a snare  measuring perhaps half a yard across and spangled  with more than a hundred thousand gumdrops and  there is yet time for some of the late flies to be  caught before night comes on She has left the  middle of the web with its dry scaffolding thread  because it is there that she hangs head downwards  waiting for her prey Sometimes however she will  prefer hiding herself under some leaves in a bush  and then she will carry with her a strong thread g  attached to the middle of the web to give her warning  of any disturbance And now a goodsized fly comes  buzzing along and running its body against the web  gives it a shake Instantly   The spiders touch how exquisitely fine  Feels at each thread and lives along the line  and almost before you can see her she has darted  from her hidingplace to the centre of the web  Here she herself gives it a shake to find whether it  will be answered showing that a live object is causing  the disturbance The unfortunate fly quivers in the  toils betraying its whereabouts and straight the  spider darts upon it and with one sharp bite ends its  life It is not however strictly speaking with her  mouth that she has bitten it but with those two  poison fangs which we spoke of just now which hang  down over the mouth While she was spinning her  web or patiently waiting under the leaves these fangs   were shut into the cases above them h z just  as a clasp knife is shut into its handle but directly  she seized her prey they were opened and the sharp  points driven into the flys body gave out poison from  their tips and quickly put an end to its life  And now being hungry she seizes the dead fly  with the two feelers or palpi of her jaws and hold  ing it to her mouth sucks out its tender juices and  she has no need to pause for breath for you will  remember that she does not breathe through her  mouth It is under her abdomen that you must  look for the two narrow slits b through which air  is taken into sacs within her body  But another interruption occurs While she is  still busy with her meal a fresh shake of the web  informs her that a new victim is caught and she  hastens to the spot This time it is a strong night  beetle which is caught in the toils and she cannot  grapple with him so rashly as with the fly while his  struggles threaten to break the net In this dilemma  she has a stratagem ready Pressing her spinnerets  against the web she begins to weave round him a  covering of silk and going closer and closer as his  legs are entangled she twists him round and round  with her feet till quite enveloped he can struggle no  longer and receives his deathblow  But if by chance it had been a wasp and she  dreaded its sting she herself would have torn the  strands of the web and let it fly away sooner than  run the risk of being the conquered instead of the  conqueror  So the garden spider lives spreading her snares  with wonderful skill and care running and dropping  from her thread with agility and precision and  making great havoc in the insect world with her  poisonous fangs and if you ask what apparatus she  has within to guide all these wonderful actions we  must go back again to the knots of nervous matter  which we found in the body of the leech For here  in the spider we find that many of these knots are  clustered thickly together in the head and neck  forming what might almost be called a brain and  connected with the line of knots running along in  the under part of the abdomen Thus while the  spider is endowed with many tools and weapons upon  her body she has also a strong battery of nerve  power within to govern them  Nor can we doubt that she owes to the stern  lessons of life much of her skill and intelligence  She has to undergo sad privations and in bad  weather when starvation stares her in the face she  is often driven to wander in search of such insects  as she can catch while long experience has taught  her race never to spin a web when it would be  destroyed by wind or rain but to fast patiently or  trust to seizing any small insects coming within her  reach rather than to use the small stock of silk  which cannot be replenished till she gets fresh food  You may perhaps wonder that all this time we  have spoken of the spider as she but the truth is  that the female spiders do most if not all of the  work for the male spiders are much smaller and  very rarely spin webs They seem to live much at  the expense of their wives and sad to relate are  very often killed by their spouses when these are  tired of their company  And now if the female spider succeeds in getting  a living and escaping the birds and other enemies  until the autumn she spins a strong cocoon of  yellow silk which she secures under some stone or  into a crack in the wall and though it measures  scarcely halfaninch across yet she manages to pack  into it from six to eight hundred eggs and then  leaves it and next spring when the warm weather  comes the young spiders struggle out of the eggs  and working themselves free from the skin which  hampers their limbs cling together in a ball for  about a month and then separate and begin to spin  webs as their mother did before them They cast  their skin many times before they are grown up and  even afterwards they creep out of it once a year and  begin again with a fresh bright coat  From this garden spider we have learnt to know  roughly the manner of life of the spinning spiders  and the tools with which they work but their  devices for gaining a living the nature of their webs  and the different nooks and corners they find for  shelter are almost endless Look at the common  housespider instead of carelessly sweeping her web  away and you will find that she lays her threads  roughly in all directions in the corner of the room  running from one to another till she has filled it up  with a fine web not sticky but so entangled that  the flies catch their feet in its meshes In one  corner you will find a little silken tube like a  thimble which she has made as a house to hide  in out of sight of her prey Her web will last  for many weeks while the gardenspider must spin  afresh or mend her web every twentyfour hours but  on the other hand the housespider is less likely to  have an abundant supply of insects and her web is  often ruthlessly destroyed She will sometimes live  from six to eight years and each year she lays her  eggs in a cocoon and hides them in a tuft of silk  thickened with scraps of whitewash and plaster and  broods over them till the young ones are born In  the walls of some outhouse or warm greenhouse you  may often find small spiders webs in the summer  time with three or four cocoons in them and  numbers of tiny spiders creeping out upon the web  Then look carefully on a summers morning  among the gorse and heath of a common and you  will find delicate webs spread almost on the surface  of the ground Instead of trampling these under foot  seek out the centre of each web and there in many  cases you will find a hole leading straight into a  tunnel in the ground This tunnel will be lined by  a tough web while at the bottom the little spider will  be crouching her feet resting on the threads and  ready in a moment to dart out when the toils are  shaken This spider has learnt how to hide herself  from the birds the squirrels the frogs and the toads  which devour her neighbours while at the same time  she spreads her nets and catches the beetles or the  Nest of one of the Trapdoor Spiders Moggiidge  D The door which closes naturally by its own elasticity and weight  m marks of the spiders claws where she has held it down from inside  midges for her daily food If when wandering along  the country lanes you look carefully in the loose soil  of the bank or the crevices of old stone walls you can  scarcely fail to find some of these tiny webs leading  into silklined holes where the spider is waiting for  her prey  Yet even these are not the most clever of all  spiders for on the shores of the Mediterranean you  may find some which not only live in silklined  tunnels but actually make doors to their houses see  Fig 66 These doors are made of layers of web  and earth and they shut down naturally by their  own weight so as to be quite hidden by the grass  growing over them but if by chance they are dis  turbed the spider herself will often rush to the top  of the tube and sticking her claws into the door  D m Fig 66 will hold it down with all her might  as she presses her body against the sides of her  home  Now see how this spider gains her living A  naturalist named Erber once sat out for many hours  on a moonlight night watching her doings and soon  after nine oclock he saw two of these spiders come  out each from their holes and pushing open their  doors fasten them back by fine threads to the blades  of grass near and then spin a web round the open  hole and go back into their tunnels By and by two  nightbeetles were caught one in each web and in  an instant the spiders darted out and pierced their  victims with their poisoned fangs sucked out their  soft flesh and then carried the empty bodies away  to some distance from their holes Then Erber left  them and in the morning the spiders had cleared  away all trace of the webs and were shut down  snugly in their hidden homes  Which among us works more cleverly or with  more industry for daily bread than these little  spiders and they do it too among many difficulties  and dangers for the birds and lizards are watching  above ground to make a meal of them and the  centipedes and other crawling insects creep into  their holes to attack them Some of them have  learned a means of escaping even this danger for  they make a second tunnel branching out of the first  and build a doorway between the two so that they  can retreat into the second passage in case of attack  and setting their back against the door baffle the  intruder  So in the air and on and under the earth the  spiders spin their webs and since they must try  every means of gaining a living in this struggling  world there are some such as the wolfspiders which  instead of spinning webs and waiting for their prey  to come to them search for it among the low bushes  and leaves and grass and use their spinners chiefly  for letting themselves drop from a height or for spin  ning their cocoons and lining the holes in the walls  where they retire for their winter sleep You may  find these running about in the woods and on heaths  and if you catch them about June you will find  each one carrying a snowywhite ball under her body  This is her cocoon containing about a hundred  eggs and if you try to take it away she will fight  for it as courageously as any human mother I  took away one three times from a mother on Keston  Common last summer and each time she seized it  again and went off gaily with it at last none the  worse for the struggle  Then there are the leapingspiders which pounce  upon their prey creeping slowly along a wall and  sliding nearer and  nearer till sudden  ly they leap and  seizing the victim  kill it and return  by the silken thread  which connects  them with the wall  above and saves  them if they fall  too far These  spiders often roll  up their cocoons  in the leaves of  some bush where  you may find them  in the early spring  The hunters and  leapers can often A Hunting Spide  find food which  does not come in the way of the webspinners and  when all the domains of earth and air are overrun  then there are other kinds which take to the water  How few people think as they walk through quiet  countrylanes that in the deep watery ditches often  to be found near rivers which run in low ground  a little waterspider may be living coming to the  top to breathe as a diver does and carrying down  air bubbles entangled in the fur which covers her  body and between her legs and so filling a curious  domed hall which she has built in the water below  It is worth some trouble to find this wonderful  little creature which has often been seen in the fens  of Cambridgeshire and in the ditches near Oxford  and also in Ireland and which though fitted to  breathe in the air has learnt to take refuge in the  water and find there her food and her home She  fixes her house on the stem of some waterplant  spinning there a thimble of delicate silk into which she  carries air shaken off as bubbles from her body and  this air rising up to the top of the thimble gradually  displaces the water and fills the whole chamber  And so in peaceful but not entirely stagnant water  On light sprays hung  By silk cords slung  Oerarched by a silken dome  Is the airy hall  With waterproof wall  Where the spider makes her home  and there she lives quite dry and spins her silken  cocoon with its hundred eggs out of which come  the young spiders which begin at once to build  and live as she does Even when she makes her  journeys to the surface to catch waterflies and  other insects or to take breath the water does not  wet her for the bubbles of air which glisten over  her body making it shine like quicksilver keep her  skin dry  And here we must take leave of the true spiders  which roam all over the world and range in size from  the huge hunting spiders of South America and  Ceylon whose legs will cover a foot of ground and  who have been seen to prey upon young birds and  lizards to the tiny red moneyspinner which is so  light that like others as small as itself it is often  carried up in the air as its thread is caught in the  light breeze It is probably from the threads of  these tiny spiders that the gossamer webs are  formed which may be sometimes seen on a bright  summer morning hanging in the air entangled in  each other either empty or with their owners within  them  Whether they are large or small however we  find in all spiders the same poison fangs the same  complex thread and the same scrupulous neatness  and cleanliness which makes them keep every joint  and hair of the body free from dust and dirt and  leads them to avoid any dead and decaying food  with disgust and a quickness of intelligence which  leads them to the most curious expedients for holding  their own in the world  But as in other classes so here too we may be  sure that lower kinds are filling nooks and corners  left by their more advanced relations and our  history of the spider family will not be complete  unless we cast a glance at the tiny insignificant  mites and ticks which swarm on the land and in  the water and live chiefly on the bodies of other  animals  These curious little creatures live that double life  which we shall find afterwards in the true insects  for while young spiders are born like the mother  and only grow larger as they cast their skins the  mites run about for some time on six legs only and  then hiding themselves in some crack in the ground  lie motionless for many days and then come out  with eight legs as minute spiders only that their  body is not divided but is all one round mass and  they breathe by means of curious airtubes like the  true insects  It is these tiny creatures which destroy the  leaves of our trees by burrowing into them and  sucking the liquid sap leaving little yellow and  faded blotches wherever they have been Some  times you may find a leaf with a fine almost invisible  web spread over its under surface and there you  may be sure that a complete colony of mites are  feeding and bringing up their little larvae or young  ones which when the leaves fall to the ground will  hide themselves under stones or in the earth and  come out perfect mites to take to fresh trees and  form new colonies Whenever you see the leaves  of a vine spotted with red there the red mite has  been taking up its home and the gardener knows  very well how the rosetrees and acacias will pine  away when the mites assert their right to live upon  them Then too there are the water mites which  swarm in the snug shallows of the wayside ponds or  sit on the smooth leaves of the waterplants in which  they pierce holes for their eggs These eggs by and  by hatch into young larvae some of which feed on  plants while others plunge their suckers into water  insects and only roll off to the bottom when they  wish to hide themselves before turning into the  perfect mites which again swim about in company  Then there are the innumerable mites and ticks  which live in the feathers of birds or on beetles and  bees and even on their relations the spiders while  others burrow in the flesh of mice dogs and cattle  holding on by sharp hooks attached to their mouth  and sucking the blood of their victims and most  of us have suffered from the bite of the harvestbug  which is a true mite and burrows under the skin of  animals and of man himself Among these mites  we find just as we did in the parasitic worms that  the more these tiny creatures live within and upon  other living beings the more do they become degraded  and lose their active powers  Thus the eight legged insects swarm in the  fields on the trees and in the water in our cheese  our flour and upon other animals and with their  tiny weapons make good their right to live and  though we scarcely recognise their existence unless  they annoy us or spoil and destroy what we value  yet the lifehistory of the scorpions the spiders and  the mites is full of interest and if we could watch  them all in their daily labour we should find them  probably quite as active and industrious as man him  self and in many cases struggling far more bravely  and patiently against the thousand dangers and  privations which threaten them at every moment of  their lives  INSECT SUCKERS AND SITERS  CHAPTER X  INSECT SUCKERS AND BITERS WHICH CHANGE  THEIR COATS BUT NOT THEIR BODIES  Yet hark how through the peopled air  The busy murmur glows  The insect youth are on the wing  Eager to taste the honeyed spring  And float amid the liquid noon  Some lightly oer the current skim  Some show their gaily gilded trim  Quick glancing to the sun GRAY  F any of us were asked the  question What is the use of plants  I think there is little doubt that we  should answer To make the world  beautiful the air pure and to provide  food for man and beast But if the  same question could be asked of the  little green aphis clinging on to the  stem of a rosetree see Fig 69 he  would know nothing of the beauty  or the pure air nor would he think  of man or beast but he would pro  bably answer that plants are made  for plantlice And from his point  of view he would be right for there is probably not  a single herb or shrub or tree in the world which  has not its own peculiar insect sucking the sap and  living upon the sweet juices We cannot do better  than begin our history of the sixlegged insects  by these little plantsuckers which we all know so  well calling them blight insects when we find  them covering our rosetrees or our geraniums in  the greenhouses or our appletrees in the garden  You may easily find them huddled together on a  stem or bud raised on their six slim legs with their  heads close down to the plant and looking sleepily  out of their two little brown eyes Yet they are by  no means asleep but very busy for their mouth  which like that of all other insects is composed of  six parts is so formed that they can plunge it deep  into the stem and suck and suck all day filling their  round green bodies with sweet sap A wonderful  little mouth it is the two lips being joined together  into a kind of split tube out of which are thrust the  four jaws in the shape of long thin lancets to pierce  the plant When once these insects have fixed  themselves they never seem to tire of sucking but  take in so much juice that after passing through the  body it oozes out again at the tail and the tips ot  two curious little tubes Fig 69 standing up on  their backs This juice falling on the stems and  leaves of the plant covers them with those sticky  drops often called honeydew  It cannot be said that these little insects lead  very exciting lives for they make no homes neither  do they take any care of their young ones and only  move about when they wish to fix upon some new  spot and yet they are very interesting both because  the ants visit them to sip their sweets as we shall  see in Chapter XII and also because they manage  to live in such numbers in spite of being so helpless  and stupid  The secret of this is that they have a special way  of sending young ones into the world If you look  at a stem covered with plantlice towards the end of  the summer you will find among the wingless sucking  insects some larger ones straggling about the plant B  Fig 69 which have delicate transparent wings These  are the fathers and mothers whose wings have grown  gradually under their splitting skins and they will  lay the eggs to be hatched next year But if you  look in the early spring you will find no winged  plantlice or aphides but only the little roundbodied  green forms and yet new ones are constantly appear  ing Where do these come from  Do you remember how the hydra of the jellyfish  went on budding and budding for years before another  true eggbearing jellyfish appeared see p 64 Now  we have an insect doing the same thing for as soon  as one of these wingless aphides is about ten or twelve  days old there come from her body not eggs but  young living aphides like herself three four or even  seven a day which struggle over the backs of their  companions till they find a clear spot on the stem  where they fix their mouths and suck like the others  only moving to struggle out of their skins about  three or four times a day till they are full grown  Then these young ones begin to bud in the same  way in their turn so that in a very short time from  two or three mothers a whole plant is covered In  fact it has been reckoned that a single aphis  may give rise in one summer to a quintillion  i 000000000000000000000000000000 of  little ones  After this we shall not be surprised that the  plantlice have taken possession of so many of the  green things in the world and the only wonder is  that they have not destroyed them all This they  would certainly have done if it were not for their  enemies but the birds delight in them as dainty  morsels beetles and earwigs devour them and flies  lay eggs in their bodies while the ladybird eats no  other food and the blind grub of a fly Musca  aphidivord glides about on the stems see g Fig 69  seizing the aphides in his mouth sucking out their  juicy bodies and dropping the empty skins by  hundreds  And now if once your eyes are open to see these  tiny juicesuckers you may find numbers of different  kinds living their little lives in the fresh country air  Have you never picked up an appleleaf or elm  leaf covered with something looking like tufts of  white cotton so sticky that you cannot clear your  fingers of it If so look carefully at it next time  you find it and under each white tuft you will see  an insect struggling along which is like a roseaphis  only without the little tubes on its back In fact  this fluffy stuff is a kind of wax which oozes out  with the sweet liquid all over the body of the insect  protecting it from the sun and from enemies as it  feeds and making it look like a lady in a feathery  white ball dress Some species of these fluffcovered  aphides fasten on to the stems of appletrees and  have been known entirely to destroy them Then  again there are others which eat their way into the  leaves of trees making rosy bladders upon them  while others attack the wheat or the hops In mild  seasons when these insects increase rapidly they have  been known to destroy a whole hopharvest  Nor are the aphides the only plantsuckers Look  at the bushes in summer and you cannot fail to see  little clusters of froth here and there Fig 70 known  as cuckoospit because they first appear at the time  when the cuckoo sings Move this froth carefully  and in the middle of it you will find the cuckoospit  grub c which has given out this froth in bubbles  from its tail to shelter it from the burning sun and  hide it from the birds as it sits and sucks the sap  But in the autumn the spit if not dried up will be  empty for the insect after losing its last coveringskin  has come out with wings a little brown froghopper  F Fig 70 which pats down upon your hand and is  gone again in a moment before you have time to  examine the wonderful beauty of its wings Then  again there are the numberless little scaly plantlice  which spend their lives flattened against the stalks  and branches of shrubs looking like little lumps upon  the stem so that while the cuckoospit is protected  by its froth the scaly plantlice often escape by their  likeness to the colour of the shrub on which they are  It is to these animals that the beautiful cochineal  insect of Mexico belongs and also the lac insect of  India which gives out the red lac used in the manu  facture of sealingwax  Al these are plant suckers and rarely move  any distance from their home but there is another  group which has learnt to run actively in search  of food of which some suck the juice of plants  while others have made use of their sharp lancet  mouths to steal the blood of animals These active  suckers are the airbugs and waterbugs and though  we dislike the name because one ugly wingless  species haunts our own rooms when we do not keep  them clean yet many are very beautiful creatures  Look among the cabbages in the garden and you  will scarcely fail to find a pretty little red and black  bug P Fig 70 running over them and piercing the  leaves for their juice while a grey one with black  red and yellow spots is busy at work on the rasp  berry fruit If you touch or frighten these plant  suckers the disagreeable smell which they will give  out from their bodies will suggest to you at once  that they belong to the bug family  Then there are those curious thinbodied insects  which skim over the ponds in the summer actually  running on the top of the water for which reason  they are called water measurers m Fig 71  because their legs when stretched out seem to mea  sure off the water as they go along These ghost  like looking insects are waterbugs whose mouths are  made for sucking like the landbugs and woe betide  the little waterflies which come in their way Pro  tected themselves from the water by a thick coating  of plush under their bodies they glide along silently  and rapidly and seizing their prey hold it in their  forelegs while they suck out the juices Thus these  active little creatures have learnt to find food on  the water which their land relations cannot reach  while a still bolder race the waterboatmen B  Fig 71 which lay their eggs on the leaves of the  waterplants dive into the water carrying their air  with them and feed upon the tadpoles and water  grubs below  In any pond in the summer time you may see  these agile insects rowing themselves along underside  uppermost by their two long hind legs and poking  their tails out of the water to take in air under their  wings Then as they row themselves down again you  can see bubble after bubble escaping from the tail till  they come up for more You might think they were  waterbeetles but their strong wings which they use  to leave their ponds by night are all four made use  of in flying whereas in beetles the two front wings are  only stiff covers to preserve the delicate ones under  neath Moreover these bugs have the same lancet  mouths as the plantlice with which they pierce the  skins of the tadpoles soft grubs and other water  animals near the bottom of the pond and suck out  their bodies leaving nothing but the empty filmlike  skins They are most voracious animals and will  attack even small fish Their habit of moving up  side down is of great use to them in feeding for  many of their victims have hard backs so the water  boatmen dive down and come up under their prey  thus attacking them on their soft side  Thus we see that the sucking lice and bugs with  their beaklike mouths have bored their way into all  kinds of living food into plants shrubs and trees in  all countries and into the flesh of men and animals  both on the land and in the water for many of  the lice on birds and other creatures belong to this  class  And yet in spite of their numbers they are not  nearly so destructive as the next class of insects we  must speak of namely the straightwinged insects  the grasshoppers crickets locusts and cockroaches  which are not content with sucking but tear and  devour the grass and leaves with their strong jaws  These greedy devourers are a very ancient race of  landinsects and in fact if we attached importance  to pedigrees they should have come first in order  for at the time when the piece of coal you put on  your fire today and which has been lying for untold  ages in the earth was part of a living forest grass  hoppers crickets and cockroaches were already creep  ing leaping and chirping in the dense jungle of ferns  and reeds where they left the remains of their bodies  among the decaying plants so that we find traces of  them now in our coalmines From that time till  now they have struggled on and while the crickets  have learnt to burrow long tunnels underground to  hide themselves in and have homes in the cracks of  walls and in company with the cockroaches in the  nooks by our firesides the locusts and the grass  hoppers have contented themselves with the open  fields and protection of the trees  When all the birds are faint with the hot sun  And hide in cooling trees a voice will run  From hedge to hedge about the newmown mead  That is the grasshoppers he takes the lead  In summer luxury he has never done  With his delight for when tired out with fun  He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed  Let us look closely at him Fig 72 for he is so  large that he will help us to understand the general  structure of a sixlegged insect better than we could  have seen it in the tiny bugs  We see at once under his wings that he has a  ringed body like the prawn but his head is separate  from his shoulders and carries only one pair of  antennae while the prawn has two His mouth with  its two little palpi sticking out is strong and power  ful and is made of six parts an upper and lower  lip with a pair of biting jaws within them which  g Very young grasshopper g the same older straggling out of its  skin G Fullgrown female grasshopper laying her eggs in the earth  o Her ovipositor or egg laying sheath s one of the spiracles or  breathingholes  move to and fro sideways to hold and cut their food  and within these again are a pair of chewing jaws to  masticate it These six parts however much they  may be altered we shall find in all sixlegged insects  and whether for piercing sucking or gnawing they  are powerful implements  Next behind the head of the grasshopper cones  his chest or thorax formed of three rings each of  which bears a pair of legs and the two hinder ones  two pairs of wings while the shoulders are covered by  a shield Behind this again comes the ringed abdomen  which he can curve and bend at will Now on looking  carefully along the sides of these rings you will see a  dark spot s on each and a magnifying glass will  show that this spot is a round plate with a slit in the  middle s Fig  73 These are  the breathing  holes or spiracles  of the grasshop  per and if you  S Spiracle or breathingplate s Fig 72 were to Cut his  with the slit in the centre which opens to take body Open under  in air  T Part of the breathingtubes or trachea water you would  showing the spiral thread which keeps the see hundreds of  tubes in their round shape minute glistening  tubes called trachea T Fig 73 running in all  directions and ending in larger tubes each of which  is joined to one of these breathing holes These  tubes are formed of two layers between which is  wound round and round a stiff wiry thread see Fig  73 which keeps the tube in shape just like the spiral  wire which they put into indiarubber tubing The  glistening is caused by the air which has been taken  in at the breathing holes and fills all the tubes  If instead of cutting open the grasshopper you  keep him alive under a glass you may watch his  abdomen moving up and down and pumping the air  in at the slits and that air will pass all through his  body along these infinitely fine branching canals  Here we have the secret why insects leap and  fly and run so easily Think how beautifully light  a body must be which instead of containing solid  flesh is full of channels of air Lyonnet counted  1572 tubes in a caterpillars body and even then  left many smaller ones unnoticed while some  insects such as the bee and the grasshopper have  not only airtubes but actual bladders of air filling  large spaces in the body Nor is it only lightness  which insects gain by this network of air tubes  for their blood being bathed in air is always full of  oxygen and therefore active and vigorous supplying  their nerves and muscles with strength quite beyond  what we should expect for their size and helping us  to understand why they have been so successful in  the battle of life  So the grasshopper with his large fixed eyes with  many hundred windows in them for structure see p  224 his delicate feelers his strong jaws his long  muscular hind legs and his light body is an active  powerful insect and an especially greedy feeder  Indeed he has between his throat and his stomach  an apparatus called a gizzard with more than 200  teeth in it for grinding the food which he has stripped  off the bushes and meadows with his cutting jaws  Even our little grasshoppers in the meadows and the  large green grasshopper living in the trees devour  greedily all that comes in their way but their ravages  are as nothing compared with those of the large  migratory locusts with short antennae which multiply  at an incredible rate in favourable seasons and move  in swarms over the south of Europe darkening the  sky for miles and devouring every green thing upon  their road  Onward they come a dark continuous cloud  Of congregated myriads numberless  The rushing of whose wings is as the sound  Of a broad river headlong in its course  Plunged from a mountain summit or the roar  Of a wild ocean in the autumn storm  Shattering its billows on a shore of rocks  and as they move they leave desolation behind them  Every leaf on tree and bush every blade of grass  every ear of corn vanishes under their attacks In  I 866 in Algeria they not only destroyed the vege  tables figtrees vines and olives but fell into the  canals and brooks in such numbers that the stench  became horrible and the French troops were called  out to destroy them and collect their bodies in heaps  to burn them and similar locust plagues cause great  devastation in America  These locusts put their eggs into the earth and  cover them up and the young locusts come out ready  at once to begin eating and exactly like the mother  only without wings which appear later when the last  loose skin is cast off Our little green grasshoppers  are locusts with short antennae and drop their eggs  in this way but crickets and true grasshoppers of  which our large green grasshopper Fig 72 is one  have a very curious and interesting implement for  laying their eggs in the earth safe from harm The  mother has a pointed egglaying sheath or ovipositor  o Fig 72 at the end of her body made of several  thin plates touching at the edges and with this she  bores a hole in the ground and then opening the  sheath drops egg after Ggg in to lie till next spring  INSECT SUCKERS AND BITERS 215  when they are hatched if they escape being devoured  by underground creatures Then as each mother has  perhaps laid between two or three hundred eggs it  is not surprising that the ground and bushes are  covered with tiny grasshoppers leaping and feeding  but without wings At this time they will all be  silent and as they go on growing will cast skin  after skin till when the sixth skin is being thrown  off g t Fig 72 their wings appear and then the  young male grasshoppers begin to rub their front  leathery wings sharply against each other so that  from their base where they have a talc like plate  with strong ridges upon it that shrill cry arises by  which they call to their friends  The crickets on the other hand will not be seen  in the daytime for they hide in holes in the ground  till night falls and then come out for food and  enjoyment The only way to entice one out by day  is to tickle the hole with a straw when they will  seize it and so can be pulled out  In the same way the house cricket hides in its  hole behind the oven where it first came from the  egg and only ventures out to leap and fly about the  kitchen at night when it steals the breadcrumbs and  flour and sips the milk and beer Often it will begin  its chirp long before it comes out and   On a lone winters evening when the frost  Has wrought a silence from the stove there thrills  The crickets song  for the warmth keeps him awake and alive But if  you leave the room through the winter without fire  then he will sleep in the cracks of the chimney till  the warm weather comes back  All these are leaping straightwinged insects  and like the plantlice they feed on vegetable food  But the cockroach which is not a black beetle as  people call it nor a beetle at all but one of the  Cockroaches  straightwinged insects has its legs formed for run  ning instead of leaping and eats all kinds of food  whether animal or vegetable not even sparing our  dishcloths if they have any grease upon them  Though we have most of us had cockroaches at one  time or another in our houses few people know any  thing of their history of the fact that the mother  has only imperfect wings while the father can fly  about or that when a cockroach changes its skin it  comes out white and soft and is some time before it  regains its dark reddish brown colour Nor is it  likely that many people will have found the curious  little horny cases of eggs c Fig 74 shaped some  thing like a bean and divided inside into separate  compartments which the mother carries about with  her half out of her body till the eggs are nearly  hatched when she hides it in the cracks of the boards  and mortar of the ovens These cases contain about  sixteen eggs ranged neatly in two rows and the  edges of the case are strongly cemented together  As soon as the eggs are hatched the young  cockroaches give out a fluid which loosens the  cement and they come out into the world small  wriggling creatures j Fig 74 with all the rings  of their body conspicuous because their wings are  not yet grown  But above all few people probably would give  cockroaches credit for being intelligent animals and  yet an escape of cockroaches which happened in the  house of a friend of mine shows them to be more clever  than is generally supposed The house being infested  with these anrmals the cook laid a trap to catch them  made of a box with two strips of glass sloping in  wards from the sides and it happened that the edges  were only about an inch from the bottom of the  inside of the box In this trap she caught many  cockroaches for after getting in they could not mount  on the glass again to get out But one evening  having noticed that the trap was nearly full before  she went to bed she was surprised in the morning to  find that all the bait was eaten and every single  insect had escaped This happened several nights  and at last she resolved to watch On doing so she  saw one of the larger cockroaches stand upon his  tail and so reach up with his front feet to the edge  of the glass and then all the other cockroaches ran  up his back out of the box he dragging himself up  last and escaping with the rest In the open country  cockroaches have many enemies which keep them in  check birds and hedgehogs devour them and bees  ants and wasps especially the sandwasps hunt them  down but in our houses nothing but cleanliness and  killing every one we meet with can rid us of this  terrible pest  And now we must pass over the other straight  winged insects the Earwig which uses its pincers to  fold its wings neatly under its wing cases and watches  over its eggs with a mothers care the Mantis or  snatching insect which in warm countries creeps along  the branches of trees with its forelegs up as if pray  ing but really in readiness to snatch any passing fly  or insect and the Leaf and Stick insects which feed  on green leaves and are protected from the birds by  looking so exactly like the leaves and stems of the  trees they crawl upon that you may touch them  without dreaming that they are living animals All  these are wonderful examples of the tricks which life  has taught to her children for protection and attack  but with the exception of the earwig the creatures  employing them belong to other countries than ours  and we cannot dwell upon them for we must turn to  another group the nervewinged insects 5 which we  meet with every day and whose history is perhaps one  of the strangest among insects  In the time of those ancient coalforests of which we  have spoken when the grasshoppers and cockroaches  lived upon the land another race of insects belonging  half to the water and half to the air were spending  their youth in the ponds and marshes and hovering  over them in their riper age These were the ances  tors of our Mayflies and dragonflies and from that  day to this they have kept up this strange existence  hunting and chasing their prey at the bottom of  ponds until the time comes for their wings to grow  and then climbing up the waterplants and bursting  forth into glorious winged animals which   To the sun their insect wings unfold  Waft on the breeze or sink in clouds of gold  Transparent forms too fine for mortal sight  Their fluid bodies half dissolved in light  Every one who has been on a warm summers day  near the borders of a lake or pond must have seen  those delicate and fragile flies called Mayflies mf  Fig 75 which dance in the sunshine flag as the sun  goes down and die in the night They are not difficult  to know with their widespread unequal wings their  short delicate antennae and their bodies ending in  three long fine bristles and they do nothing but rise  and fall in and out in a mazy dance for they have  but a few hours to live and their mouths are too soft  for them to take food In fact the whole end and  aim of their winged life is to form and lay eggs in  little packets on the water to hatch into future young  ones And yet they are not really mere creatures  of a day as they have been called for before they  obtained their wings they lived for nearly two years  at the bottom of the pond over which they now fly  Their real life is that of a waterinsect ing which  as soon as the eggs are hatched dives to the bottom  of the pond and burrows in the ground or under  stones and feeds upon all passing insects seizing  them with strong spiny jaws and devouring them  greedily At this time the May grub does not  breathe through holes in the side but has its body  fringed with gills or delicate folds of skin which take  in air out of the water and there is nothing in its  appearance to lead any one to believe that it could  ever live in the air But as it grows up and loses one  loose skin after another the rudiments of wings are  seen through the transparent covering and then the  end of its life is beginning It creeps out upon some  plant or stone overhanging the water the skin cracks  down the back and the flying insect comes out with  its wings perfectly visible Still it cannot use them  for a fine film covers the whole body and it is only  a few hours after when this has dried and split that  the perfect Mayfly soars away an airbreathing insect  to lay its eggs and die  We need not then pity these frail delicate eph  emera on account of their short life for they have  had a long and merry one feeding in the pond below  and when we see them they are taking their last  enjoyment before night falls  The same thing is true of the caddisflies or water  moths cf Fig 75 which anglers use as bait for  they too cannot feed after they get their wings but  their life in the pool below has been rather different  Their tail is soft like that of the hermitcrab and they  need to liide it in some strong covering And for  this purpose they build themselves tubes of silk into  which they weave pieces of wood and grass or of  sand and stone and even sometimes shells with living  creatures in them and dragging these tubes about vith  them they put out their strong head and shoulders  and feed on plants and insects Then when the time  comes for their change they draw back into their case  and closing it with a grating of silk at each end so  that water can get in while enemies are shut out  they lie still for a fortnight like a caterpillar in its  chrysalis and then swim out and creeping up some  plant burst their covering skin and hover over the  pond or rest upon the bushes till their eggs are laid  and they die  Thus the Mayfly and Caddisfly live chiefly in  the water finding plenty of food during all their  growing time while they have but a short glimpse  of the pleasures of the air Not so however the  gorgeouswinged Dragonfly He manages to make  the most of both worlds and whether he is crawling  in the water below or flying in the air above is one  of the most voracious and bloodthirsty of insects  Even when he is a watergrub though he moves  very slowly yet the quickest of insects cannot escape  from him for he has a peculiar under lip in Fig 76  very long and with two sharp hooks at its broad  end with which he seizes them This lip folds back  by a kind of hinge and is called a mask because  it covers the lower part of his face and makes  him look an innocent and harmless creature The  moment an insect comes by the lip is shot out and  the pincers grasp the prey throwing it into his mouth  as the mask again closes So gliding stealthily  along the bottom the greedy creature seizes all that  comes in his way grubs worms waterslugs and  even small fish are all attacked by him and though he  is sometimes devoured in his turn by other animals  yet he often escapes for he breathes by taking in  water at his tail and when he wishes to get out of  the way he shoots this water out and drives himself  along much as we saw the octopus do only that the  dragonfly grub goes forwards instead of backwards  So in a year he grows big and strong and short  wings begin to appear under his skin Then he  crawls listlessly to the top of a plant and there  dragging himself out of his covering he gradu  ally expands his large gauze wings filled with  delicate air channels and shaking free his sharp  clawed feet is at once ready for new victims His  large gleaming eyes with their thousands of windows  often 12000 each with its  own i ens an d cone and rod  see Fig 77 espy a butterfly  or a moth and in an instant  he is pursuing it flying  upwards downwards and  sideways without turning  by means of the peculiar  muscles by which his wings  work upon his bulky shoul  Section of an Insects Eye ders while his long body  a Nervemass of the eye b serves as a rudder And  nerves springing from it c when he hag caug h t his prey  the retina d threadlike rods r J  by which the picture is formed he tears it savagely with  e glasslike cones lenslike n j s horny jaws scattering  facets of which each eye may  have from 10000 to 20000 lts shattered wings upon  the ground Much as we  admire the beautiful colours and magnificent wings of  the dragonfly we must admit that when he reckons  back his ancestors through the dim ages to those  distant coalforests he must look along a line of the  most greedy and cruel marauders of the insect world  Nor has he been content with ravaging the  water and the air only for one of his very near  relations the antlion JVfyrmeleon formicarius  which is to be found in France and most warm coun  tries and which when it has its wings might be  mistaken for a dragonfly lives its early life in dry  sand in which it twists round and round till it has  made a funnelshaped hole at the bottom of which  it lies see plate p 135 This it does near an ants  nest and when an ant running on the edge of the  funnel slips in the antlion flings sand upon it so  that it tumbles to the bottom and he can devour it  Thus in the water on the land and in the air the  dragonflies have a good time of it if they can only  escape the swallows and other quick flying birds  which pounce down upon them and the scorpion  flies which though much smaller than themselves  sting them to death  And now we come to the most interesting of  all the nervewinged animals the Termites or white  ants the plagues of India and Africa Every one  has heard of these destructive creatures which feed  so cunningly out of sight eating their way from the  ground beneath up the middle of posts beams  woodwork and furniture and even sometimes prop  ping up with hardened mud and slime the build  ings they are eating away so that no one finds  them out till all at once some part falls down and  exposes the rottenness within They are so clever  and have so many habits like true ants that they  have been called by their name and most people  think that they are their near relations But this is  not so on the contrary while the ants stand at the  head of the most highly developed insects and have  a helpless infancy and a true chrysalis state before  they are fit for work the termites have come along  quite a different line and belong to those ancient  nervewinged insects which work from their earliest  age and have no time of rest to prepare for their  grownup life So when we find these white  ants living together and building houses and having  workmen and soldiers besides the true king and   Termes bdlicosus  queen of the nation we see that they must have  learned these habits quite independently of the true  ants with which they have nothing to do  A strange and wonderful thing a termite com  munity is Perhaps in India you find one day that  the sill of your window or the post of your door  is rotten and then when you begin to cut it you  find it completely hollowed out into little cham  bers the wood being eaten away At first these  chambers are empty but as you go on you find  small soft white insects with six feet running hither  and thither These insects are quite blind and  wingless and always work in the dark Even if  they come out on the surface of the wall or the  ground they cement wooddust together or carry up  clay to make a tunnel under cover of which they  travel up and down In a single night a tube may  appear all up your wall which is a termite tunnel  built to enable the insects to reach some fresh store  of woodwork If you watch you may see the tunnel  grow at its open end as one little white grub after  another comes to the opening and laying on its little  bit of mudwork goes back to make room for the  next Mingled with these workers are much larger  insects also blind and wingless with huge heads and  jaws shaped like jagged stilettoes These are the  soldiers they do not work but defend the labourers  hanging on to any enemy with their sharp pincers  and allowing themselves to be torn to pieces rather  than give way  And now as you penetrate farther and farther  through the woodwork and probably down into the  ground belcw the small chambers begin to be filled  with little white eggs and with snowwhite young  workers and soldiers which feed on a kind of mouldy  fungus growing on the walls of their rooms At last  in the midst of these you come upon a large cell with  a long soft whitishbrown lump in it as big as your  finger and looking something like an uncooked  sausage Figs 78 and 79 At first you would  think this was a mere bag but looking at one end  you would see three rings each with a pair of legs  and a head if Fig 79 with eyes and feelers and  mouth This white lump then is part of a living  creature it is the abdomen of a termite queen  swollen to nearly 2000 times its natural size and  full of eggs There she lies with her husband k y  Fig 78 who is much bigger even than the soldiers  but nothing as compared to his queen crouching by  her side and while the working termites feed her and  caress her she goes on laying eggs incessantly about  60 a minute These the workers carry away as fast  as she lays them and store them in the nursery  chambers around but the holes through which they  pass out of the queens cell o Fig 79 are far too  small for either of the royal pair to escape  The history of this curious community has been  as follows About two years ago before the heavy  autumn rains began this king and queen with thou  sands of others were born from the eggs of another  huge queen and when they had cast their skin  they came out each with four gauzy wings and flew  into the country or often into the houses if their  nest was in a town But their bodies were heavy  and their wings weak and so they soon fell to the  ground where nearly all their companions were eaten  by birds and ants and other creatures They how  ever chanced to escape and losing their wings were  found by a party of working termites At once these  active wingless workers carried the royal pair into  their tunnel and built a clay chamber round them  with only small openings in it Fig 79 not large  enough for them to get out There they fed them  carefully and by and by the abdomen of the queen  began to swell and from that time her whole mission  was to lay eggs As her size increased the workers  enlarged her chamber and meanwhile were toiling  busily making nurseries for the eggs and storehouses  for the shavings of wood and masses of vegetable  gum which they collected by burrowing in every  direction through living trees or beams or wood  work of any kind  You may imagine how many nurseries must be  built besides new rooms for grownup workers if  80000 eggs are laid every iay and besides these  nurseries there are innumerable galleries and passages  which are all so arranged that air passes through the  whole building The work goes on in perfect order  some tend the queen and all show her the utmost  attention and affection some store the eggs some  look after the young while others enlarge the build  ing or tunnel for long distances underground to get  food And all this is done by blind workers in pitch  darkness with a regularity and precision which is  most marvellous and can probably only be accounted  for by the supposition that their antennae are far more  delicate and useful implements than we can as yet  understand  There are many species of these Termites Some  live in buildings and the town of La Rochelle in  France where they have probably been brought from  the West Indies has been sadly damaged by them  Others in Africa build enormous mounds of clay and  earth see Fig 78 as much as from twelve to twenty  feet high and so strong that the buffaloes stand  upon them to look over the plains and inside these  are innumerable galleries and floors of storehouses  and nurseries If an attempt is made to destroy  these mounds the soldier termites which are about  one in a hundred as compared to the workers swarm  out and fall upon the enemy while the workers begin at  once to repair the damage Other species build nests  in tall trees driven there no doubt to escape from the  true ants which having hard bodies can attack the  soft termites and destroy them easily Lastly there  are some which come above ground and march from  place to place like a regular army and these are the  most remarkable for not only have the soldiers and  workers eyes so that they see their way but Smeath  man who studied them in Africa saw the workers  marching in regular streams or columns twelve or  fifteen abreast guarded by the soldiers while sentinels  were placed on plants along the road These  soldiers struck the leaves every now and then with  their jaws making a ticking noise to which the  workers answered with a hiss and then quickened  their pace  And here we must end our history There is pro  bably nothing more curious in the whole insect world  than the termite communities for these children  of Life have learnt lessons far above any of their  near relations while the necessity of preparing for  and tending the eggs which the queens lay at such a  prodigious rate makes the whole nest a constant  scene of activity and contrivance The study of  their habits and customs is one of the greatest  possible interest but here we must content ourselves  with a mere general glimpse and with establish  ing firmly in our minds the fact that the white  ants of India and Africa are quite a different race  and beloig to a totally different order of insects  from their darker namesakes in England They  belong to the nerve winged insects and together  with all those included in this chapter they are born  in the same shape as their parents only without wings  For we shall notice that the aphides and the  bugs the grasshoppers and cockroaches the may  flies and dragon flies as well as the termites change  their coats as they grow too small for them creeping  out of their skins many times in their lives But  they do not change their bodies as we shall see in  the next chapter is done by the caterpillars and  butterflies Neither have they with the exception of  the caddisflies any time of trance as the caterpillar  has in its chrysalis They are active from birth to  death and though when their time for laying eggs  comes they put forth wings to carry them to their  mates and to suitable spots for laying still they have  not yet fallen upon the expedient of taking a time  of rest and forming a new and beautiful body  CHAPTER XL  INSECT SIPPERS AND GNAWERS WHICH REMODEL  THEIR BODIES WITHIN THEIR COATS  And many an antenatal tomb  Where butterflies dream of the life to come  She left clinging round the smooth and dark  Edge of the odorous cedar bark  THE SENSITIVE PLANT  MONG all the strange and  puzzling facts in the history  of living things there is per  haps none which has at  tracted so much attention as the  complete metamorphosis or change  in the bodies of insects by means  of which a creature begins its life  in one form then hangs itself up  in a hard skin or a silken shroud  or buries itself out of sight and  comes out at last so totally differ  ent in appearance that if we had  not watched it passing from the one  shape to the other we could never  have believed it to be the same creature  Who would believe at first sight that a butterfly  or moth had once been a creeping caterpillar or  that the hurrying busy beetle and the active fly had  burrowed as maggots or grubs in decaying matter or  in the trunks of trees or in the fruits and flowers of  plants or still less that each active hopping flea  once rolled about helplessly as a little hairy grub  and span a tiny silk cocoon in which its present  body was formed  To those who have only paid attention to the  higher animals such as birds fishes and quadrupeds  which when they are born have already assumed a  fairly settled form this springing up of one being  out of the husk of another apparently quite unlike it  seems strange and unnatural and in olden times all  kinds of fanciful ideas were connected with the  metamorphosis of insects But if we begin as we  have now done by Lifes simplest children and see  how in each successive group the necessity for  making the best of everything causes many creatures  to alter their form and habits at different periods of  their lives then these curious changes in insects have  a real meaning and we can set to work patiently in  the hope of discovering what advantage they are to  the creature which undergoes them  Thus for example we have already found the  sponge beginning as a swimming animal see p 38  and then drawing in its lashes and settling down to  build a solid skeleton clothed with a colony of cells  while the lassothrowers begin by swimming go on  as stationary branching and budding animals and  end by throwing off eggbearing jellybells quite as  unlike the animal tree as a butterfly is unlike a  caterpillar In the starfish and seaurchins the  transformation scene is still more curious for the  jellyanimal is swimming about and feeding with its  special mouth and stomach see p 78 while a  second and differently shaped form with a mouth  and stomach and feet of its own is growing up  inside yet both these beings are part of one single  creature and when the form within is ready to get  its own living it swallows its earlier self and goes its  way So too the headless mollusca such as the oyster  and cockle swim about in their young life and have  eyes which they lose when they settle down while the  crab undergoes such complete changes see Fig 59  p 167 that no one would recognise parent and child  if they saw them together  We learn then that it is not the exception but  in many cases the rule for a creature to take on  different forms at different times of its life and the  chief novelty in the metamorphosis of insects turns  out to be that they have learnt to do one thing at a  time and after passing their early life in incessant  feeding and storing up of material for a more perfect  body they retire from the world to spend all their  energy in building up those new and beautiful bodies  which we admire so much in the lovely painted  butterfly or the gorgeous metallicwinged beetle  Nor shall we wonder that this quiet is necessary  when we understand the marvellous change which  takes place in them The cockroach and the cricket  only gain wings by their last change of skin and  though the Mayfly alters its apparatus for breathing  so as to be able to live in the air still the greater  part of its body remains the same But the cater  pillar and the grub have actually to remodel every  part of their bodies in order to become the butterfly  or the beetle and we can scarcely say that any  portion of them remains as it was except that  mysterious lifepower which brings to them from past  generations the experience to guide them in their  development and their work Yet so true is this  experience so well has the lesson been learnt by the  countless ancestors which have gone before that  among the thousands of different kinds of grub  and maggot and caterpillar each follows its own  peculiar road as its forefathers have done before it  and wrapping itself in its own special form of covering  goes through its curious change and comes out as  fly butterfly moth or beetle with those weapons  and ornaments which it needs for the rest of its  existence  Of all the marvels of life surely this is one of the  most marvellous and why or how each one puts on its  peculiar dress we can scarcely ever hope to know But  we may gain some slight idea of the general process  by which a creeping worm is changed into a winged  insect and to do this let us sketch out the life of  the common Tortoiseshell butterfly which Mr New  port watched through all its changes nearly fifty  years ago  It is under the fresh green shoots of the common  nettle that the tortoiseshell butterfly mother lays  her cluster of eggs in the early summer after she has  crept out of the crack in the wall or paling where  she had remained hidden for her long winter sleep  Coming out with worn wings and faded colours she  enjoys a short flight in the sunshine with others of  her kind and then leaves her eggs where the young  will find food and goes her way to die And in a  week or two when these eggs are hatched there creep  out little yellowishgrey caterpillars and these give  out at once a fine silken thread from their under lip  and spin a slight web over a leaf This done they  crawl away in company and travel from leaf to leaf  feeding busily all day but always returning to their  silken tent at night They have no thought beyond  eating as they move along on their ten cushion feet  two at the tail and four under the abdomen cf Figs  80 and 8 1 which are not true feet at all but foldings  in the skin each bearing a circle of spines which  help it to cling to the twigs Their six real jointed  feet f Fig 81 p 239 near the head they use  both for walking and for grasping the leaf while  they cut it with their horny mandibles or outer jaws  m Fig 80 which work horizontally between their  lips and then pass the pieces on to be chewed by the  real jaws within whose palpi or feelers are seen at  Thus they feed and feed alway guided probably  chiefly by touch and taste though they have tiny  simple eyes They do not need to pause for breath  since that is taken in through the holes in their  sides b Fig 81 and they eat so greedily that after  a time their skin becomes too tight for the food they  are packing into it Then they pause and turn pale  and remain still for a while after which each one  bends up his back swells out his rings and so splits  the inconvenient coat along the back Then drawing  out first his head and then his tail he comes out fresh  in colour with every joint and hair in its place and  begins gorging once more This they do as many  as five separate times and at the end of these  changes their new form is already growing within  them for if you cut open a caterpillar just before it  casts its last skin you may see the outline of the  wings and antennae of the future butterfly in a  watery state each in its transparent sheath  And now they must shut themselves up from the  outer world for each one has to make a sipping  mouth instead of a biting one and to gather up his  muscles to make his shoulders strong to bear his  wings and above all he has to draw together the  line of nerve knots which in the caterpillar are  stretched along his body as we saw them in the  leech p 143 but which in the butterfly must be  concentrated so as to make great central nerve  stations in the head for the use of the large eyes and  sensitive antennas which are coming and other sta  tions under the shoulders to supply his wings with  energy  So each caterpillar again leaves off eating and  finding some firm spot on the trunk of a tree or a  post or a stem of a plant makes there a little hillock  of silk and clinging to it by his hind feet lets him  self swing head downwards Fig 8 1 Then his head  and shoulders begin to swell the nervous knots within  his body to draw together the airtubes to expand  and the skin to crack so that by vigorous efforts he  can push his whole body covering back to his tail  where at last it drops off leaving him hanging by  some small hooks at the end of his body A curious  fellow he looks now as each part of the future butter  fly is dimly seen in its protecting sheath His tiny  wings his six true feet his antennae and his sipping  trunk have all begun to form but are far from com  plete and to keep them safe till they are full grown  a clear fluid oozes out and flows over all hardening  into a firm transparent case and as in some butterflies  the reflection of light from the under surface of this  case has a golden tint the name of chrysalis chrysos  gold has been given to the still and quiet form  but the word pupa doll is perhaps better because  many have not this golden hue  It is within this sheath that in about three weeks  the butterflys body is gradually formed and all the  fat which the caterpillar had stored in the spaces of  its body is worked up into muscle and nerve and  eggproducing parts At last all is complete the  head shoulders and abdomen have taken on their  real shape the delicate tinted scales which cover the  wings and deck them with gorgeous colours are  full grown the wings themselves made of two layers  of skin between which are the airtubes and the  veins presently to be filled with colourless blood are  all ready while the little pockets in the body which  make the fullgrown insect so much lighter than  the caterpillar are waiting to be expanded with air  The nerves begin to send messages to the limbs to  move and the perfect butterfly splitting its trans  parent covering creeps out into the world slowly but  surely inflates its body and wings and letting them  dry in the sun soars off to sip the flowers and find  a mate  But what a different creature we have here from  the creeping gnawing spinning caterpillar The two  lips of the caterpillar with the silkspinning tube sp  Fig 80 in the lower one are reduced to mere frag  ments the horny mandibles m m no longer needed  now the chief feeding time is past have almost dis  appeared while the two inner jaws are drawn out into  long hollow channels and fit together so as to form  the delicate tube which is to suck honey from the  flowers The tiny eyes e of the caterpillar if they  are still to be found in the forehead are quite in  significant when compared with two large many  windowed eyes e e which now stand out on each side  of the head to warn the rapidlyflying insect of danger  from all directions The tiny stunted antennae of the  caterpillar have become long and delicate The  shoulders grown firm and strong carry the six slender  legs and two pairs of wings which are worked by  powerful muscles and over these wings is spread a  carpet of beautiful scales each one fitting by means of  a little tube into the wing and the whole making a  brilliant pattern to attract the eyes of the mate  which the butterfly now wishes to find The abdomen  has lost on the outside the cushion feet which are no  longer needed while within the long digestive tube  which it had as a caterpillar has become quite small  making room for an apparatus for forming and laying  eggs  And yet though such a total remodelling has  taken place there has been no such thing as death  and new life between the caterpillar and the butterfly  Though the chrysalis hung in such a still and death  like form it was the same living insect breathing  almost imperceptibly and able to move slightly if  touched Only the life within it which in the first  stage was busy storing up material in the caterpillar  was entirely occupied during this second stage in  moulding that material into the future butterfly  which in the third stage as a perfect insect completes  the history  We see then that one of the great questions in  all creatures which remodel their bodies must be  how they can keep themselves from danger in this  second stage when they are so helpless Some go  through their changes quickly and then they are  comparatively careless of anything but to choose  a secluded spot Our tortoiseshell butterfly for  example hangs very insecurely by the slender thread  of her chrysalis But then she is generally but little  more than a fortnight or three weeks completing  her change and even when born in the autumn she  becomes a butterfly before the winter and goes to  sleep in this form hiding in the chinks of walls or  palings or in the bark of trees till the warm spring  comes round unless indeed some mild day in  January wakes her before her time when she gener  ally dies as the penalty for mistaking the season  But the common cabbage butterfly if born late  in the year often remains as a chrysalis from Sep  tember to April and would hang very unsafely  exposed to the rough winds if merely attached by  the tail So the caterpillars of this butterfly as of  many others bind themselves firmly to the paling or  wall by a narrow band of silk If you can catch  sight of this caterpillar just when beginning its  change you may see it first make a little tuft of silk  t Fig 82 in which it plants its tail and then  turning back its head pass the silk from its tip  across and across the body b so that by and by  when the skin is shed the chrysalis remains firmly  tied to the paling  One of these two ways of fastening themselves  are followed by almost all the caterpillars of butter  flies except a few which roll themselves in leaves or  bind themselves in slender webs But the moth  Fig 82  Caterpillar and Chrysalis of Cabbage Butterfly bound to a paling  t Tuft of silk holding the tail b b Silken band securing  the chrysalis  caterpillars are much more clever at hiding and in  many ways are more interesting than those of butter  flies  Naturalists are in the habit of dividing the Lepi  doptera or scale winged insects into moths and  butterflies and although there is no real distinction  between them yet in a general way it is not difficult  to tell them apart  A moth as a rule lays its wings down upon its  back when at rest while a butterfly folds them up  back to back against each other and though some  moths copy the butterflies in this they are not many  Again most butterflies have their antennae thick  at the tip while those of moths are more generally  fine at the end and thicker in the middle and are  often beautifully feathered but this rule also is not  without exceptions Again the wings of moths are  fastened together by a kind of hook which makes  them work much more strongly and not with the  irregular movement which we find in butterflies  lastly the shoulders of moths are broader than  those of most butterflies and less distinctly divided  by a waist from the abdomen By some of these  characters as well as in many cases by their noc  turnal habits moths may be generally known al  though it must be remembered that they are such  near relations to the butterflies that no clear line can  be drawn between the two  But in their habits and devices the moths far  outstrip the butterflies It is their caterpillars which  among the sphinx moths remain motionless for  hours on twigs with the head bent down so as  to look like part of the bush thus escaping the  notice of the birds which would eat them and of the  ichneumonflies which would lay their eggs on their  bodies And these same caterpillars when the time  of their rest comes burrow into the ground and line  their home with varnished silk so that no water can  creep in Here safe and sound from wet and cold  they cast off their skin for the last time and lie as  pupae during the long winter till the warmth of June  wakes them into moth life  It is the caterpillars of moths too which spin  those silken cocoons which hang from tree or bush  or under walls and palings homes so delicate and  yet so dry and snug that the tender pupa lying  freely inside them is like a child in its warm bed at  night Any one who has kept silkworms will  know how cleverly the caterpillar bending its head  back towards its tail so that its feet are outside  begins its outer eggshaped layer of silk by moving  its head to and fro in some nook or corner and  leaving a bed of fluff within which it spins the coil  of finer silk You may watch the cocoon growing  for a time as the caterpillars head moves round  and round in an oval form leaving its silken trail  behind it But gradually the meshes grow finer and  finer and you can no longer see through them while  still the industrious creature goes on till its head has  been round the oval at least three hundred thousand  times and it has made a stout cocoon  Once safe inside its silken house it pushes off its  caterpillar skin and remains a protected pupa for a  fortnight or more Then if you have not already  robbed it of its silk the moth after it has crept out  of the pupa skin must work its way through the  cocoon This it does by giving out a liquid which  is contained in a little bladder in its head and  soaking the silken wall so as to separate the threads  and make a path for itself to the outer air But  curiously enough it will not attempt to fly far for the  silkworm moth belonging as it does to a genus  already feeble in flight and having besides been  kept in confinement for generation after generation  makes scarcely any use of its wings  Out of just such cocoons as this but of coarser  make with a tiny hole left at one end come the  beautiful emperormoth the night peacock and the  curious Oakeggar moth whose caterpillar sleeps  all through the autumn and winter before beginning  to feed and spin its cocoon while the Burnet moths  Fig 83 often spin very thin cocoons covered with  a kind of varnish which makes them as strong as  parchment With a little trouble you may often find  the empty cases of these and other moths left on the  grass and bushes in July and August when the insects  are fluttering over the gardens and fields But the  cocoons of the Processionmoths which climb the  oaktrees at night to feed you will find all enclosed  in one large nest of silk for these caterpillars live  in companies in a hanging web and when they are  ready to remodel  their bodies they  strengthen the web  with their moulted  skins and lie all  together each spin  ning his tiny cocoon  round his body  Again there are  many caterpillars  which have not suf  ficient silk to spin  a whole cocoon and  they have learnt  other devices Thus  some of the sphinx  caterpillars make  cocoons of dried  leaves woven to Psyche graminella  Cther and lined g Front part of the caterpillar with the  Infli cilt anH rnllrl six true feet C Case f Straw and S raSS  with silk and rolled covering the rest of the caterp iiiar and in  Up in these they lie which it will hide as a chrysalis m perfect  under the cover of moth  some stone or bush The hairy caterpillars also many  of them use their hairs for the cocoons binding them  together with a little silk while a group of moths  called Psyches Fig 84 because they are so small and  light come from caterpillars which as soon as they are  born take pieces of straw or leaf or grass and bind  them together into cases in which they live feeding  under cover of the little house which they enlarge  from time to time and use later on to shelter their  chrysalis It is worth noticing that these cater  pillars living in a case do not need broad falsefeet  to clasp the stems so these are reduced to quite small  cushions with a ring of strong hooks to hold fast  to the case Then there are the leafrolling cater  pillars which twist up the margins of leaves and use  their silk to bind them into tubes for their resting  places while the huge caterpillar of the Goatmoth  gnaws its way into the old trunks of willows and  elms and after feeding and tunneling there for three  years creeps just under the bark and gums together  a cocoon of powdered wood lined with soft silk in  which it lies safe and snug till transformed into the  large and beautiful moth  It would require a whole volume to trace out the  many devices of the mothcaterpillars to escape their  enemies and to find shelter from wind and weather  during their retreat from the world in some cases of  weeks and in others of many months But with  the exception of the Goatmoth all those of which  we have spoken feed openly as long as they are  caterpillars on the leaves of trees and plants and  have no special means beyond their green or brown  colour or sometimes their nauseous flavour for elud  ing their persecutors It remained for the tiny Leaf  miners to find out the plan of living between the  two sides of a leaf and so eating their way peacefully  in covered galleries These little caterpillars coming  out of their eggs on the under side of a roseleaf or  honeysuckle leaf bore at once into it and creep  along eating the flesh of the leaf between the two  surfaces till they are full fed and then they pierce  through the upper skin and creeping out spin those  curious little orange cocoons which you may find in  the summer clinging to the stems of roses If you  haveonce looked for the tracks of these tiny insectsyou  may easily find them  showing as pale wavy  lines on the honey  suckle and other leaves  So you may also  trace lines something  of the same kind but  more unpleasant in  our eyes on our own  woollen clothes which  have been laid by for  the summer These  are made by cater  pillars of the same  family as the leaf   J L The ClothesMoth  miners but as there are   g Grub feeding in its woollen tube  no covering skins here t nake d grab taken out of the  between which they can tube pupa hanging in the tube  lie the clever little fel m moth  lows build tubes for themselves t Fig 85 out of the  wool which they tear off the clothes They live in  these just as the Psyche caterpillars live in the grass  tubes and when they are going to remodel their bodies  they close one end of the tube and fasten it to the  side of the box or cupboard p Fig 8 and then  turning themselves with their head to the open end  are ready to come out when they have developed  into those little grey moths we know but too well  And here we must leave the butterflies and moths  without touching upon those mothcaterpillars which  live in the water or those which steal the honey from  the bees or the tiny butterflycaterpillars which live in  the clover and grass and whose eggs we tread upon  as we walk Each little butterfly or moth which we  watch gamboling in the sunshine or disturb from its  sleep in the hedges or on the mosscovered walls has  its own habits and history its favourite plant on which  it feeds and to which its caterpillar feet are often spe  cially adapted its time for flying and for resting its  special hidingplaces for its pupa and its own lovely  markings on the wings which when open attract its  mates and when closed often shelter it by making it  look like the plants upon which it alights while many  moths which fly at night have even a peculiar scent  by which they find each other in the dark And one  and all have their object in life the male butterflies  to find a mate and the mothers to find the plant on  which they themselves fed as caterpillars there to lay  their eggs Moreover they are unconsciously doing  useful work for as they pass from flower to flower  sipping the honey they carry the pollen dust on  their bodies and fertilise the lovely blossoms which  enliven our fields and hedges and in so doing help  to make the seeds which grow up into fresh plants  for those which come after them  But as these delicate children of Life flutter  through the world innumerable dangers meet them  on their way as caterpillars pupae and butterflies  hundreds are destroyed by birds and by other insects  while the pitiless wind and soaking rain of our English  summers often batter their tender wings before they  can creep under shelter In this respect they are far  worse off than our next group the Beetles which are  gnawing insects during both the active seasons of their  life and whose front wings are not used in flying but  form those beautiful sheaths called elytra 7 which so  often make these insects look like brilliant jewels  These elytra in many beetles are very hard and  strong and serve to cover up safely the pair of large  transparent hind wings which are used in flying  There can scarcely be any doubt that the beetles  are especially well provided with weapons for fighting  the battle of life for they have not only managed to  spread into every country on the globe but are by  far the most numerous of all insects From the huge  Goliath beetle of Africa five inches long down to the  minute rove beetles which give such sharp pricks  when they fly into our eyes on summer evenings  beetles are of all sizes and live in almost all con  ceivable ways While many feed on plants others  are fierce hunters and even cannibals devouring  each other in the most cruel manner while a very  large number feed on dead and decaying matter and  are most useful scavengers and not a few feed on  animals when young and plants after they awake  from their long sleep For beetles like butterflies  have three lives first as grubs or maggots secondly  as helpless pupae or swaddled insects and it is only  when they come to the third stage that they are true  beetles with wings and the power of laying eggs  The cockchafer or Maybug which blunders up  against us as he flies heavily in the night air began  his life underground more than three years ago  His mother groping down into the earth in the early  spring hid herself there and laid from thirty to forty  eggs which at the end of about five weeks were  hatched and became blind white grubs g Fig 86  with six slender black legs and hard horny jaws  After a short time these grubs set to work to gnaw  the tender roots of the young summer plants and  during the next three years fed vigorously under  ground eating first what was near them and then  making galleries in all directions and devouring the  roots of strawberry plants or rosetrees oats or corn or  clover till many were devoured themselves by moles  and hedgehogs or if they ventured too near the  surface of the ground by rooks crows and magpies  which sit upon the clods and pick them out of the  loose ground Those which escaped and they are  usually many burrowed down deep in the winter  out of the way of frost and wet to come up agan  in the spring to feed afresh But at the end of the  third year after having shed their skins several times  they laid themselves down to rest in the earth and  giving out a kind of sticky froth which they bound  with threads of silk into a cocoon c Fig 86 they  split their last grub skin and remained as pupae or  swaddled insects with their imperfect wings  folded over their legs and antennae Then early in  the fourth year about April the true cockchafer  began to stir in the cocoon and crept out of the  ground hungry with its long fast and flying up to  the trees began to gnaw and eat for the short two  months remaining of its life and it is then that we  meet with it flying from tree to tree and browsing  with its strong mandibles on the leaves of the oaks  and beeches and maples  The history of the cockchafer is that also of many  other beetles The grubs of the beautiful golden  green rosebeetle and many others live underground  feeding on the roots of plants and the great stag  beetle whose sharp jaws as a grub enable him to  eat into solid wood only makes this difference that  he spends his three or sometimes even six years of  childhood in the trunk of an old oaktree gnawing  away at it for his daily meal and only sees day  light when he eats his way out as the perfect beetle  But the little weevils with their curious snouts  Fig 87 which they use for piercing holes in which  to place their eggs love best the centre of flowers or  tender leaves or especially fruits and nuts of various  kinds for their nursery When we crack a nut and  find a fat white maggot inside we have disturbed  the forerunner of one of these little weevils which  if the nut had remained on the tree would by and  by have worked its way out m Fig 87 and fallen  to the ground where it would have gone to sleep all  through the winter to wake with a long thin snout  and a pair of delicate wings hidden under its beauti  ful brown wingcases The peamaggot on the other  hand would if we had left it alone have lain down  just within the delicate skin of the pea and there  been transformed into a tiny brown beetle spotted  with white  Many of the weevils do indeed eat the bark and  wood and roots of trees for they are a very numerous  family and must find food where they can but the  greater number of them feed on fruits buds flowers  and grains of all kinds so that you need only hunt  among the acorns and wheat and rape and turnips  to make acquaintance with these tiny beetles or if  you seek out the faded dingy brown blossoms on  an appletree which remain when the other bright  blossoms are turning into fruit there you may find  either a tiny chrysalis or a short snouted weevil  which has lived all its life in this blossom since its  mother laid the egg in the early spring and whose  food as a maggot has been the tender centre of the  flower  These are all plant eating beetles and they or  some of their comrades may be found on every plant  or tree nay you may even shake a shower of them  out of the folds of a large mushroom though they  are so small you must get a microscope to see them  But the Tigerbeetle with its brilliant golden green  wingcases the Bombardier beetle see Plate II  p 135 which shoots out a vapour from its tail  when it is attacked the common garden beetle or  Carabus which pours a black fluid on your fingers  when you catch it and even the delicate little Lady  bird which is a true beetle are all animal feeders  and they destroy a whole host of insects such  as aphides caterpillars weevils cockchafers centi  pedes and flies The young wingless ladybird  creeps after the aphides eating them one by one  up the stem as we saw the blind grub of the fly  doing in Fig 69 while the grubs of the tigerbeetle  have a most cunning way of catching their food for  they bury themselves in the soil with their mouths  just above the ground so that the ants and small  insects run heedlessly into their jaws  These and many other beetles feed greedily upon  living creatures and are quite as eager hunters of  small animals as lions and tigers are among large  ones You need only watch the ugly cocktail beetle  Plate II p 135 scampering after some insect or seiz  ing upon one of its weaker brethren as it cocks up its  head and tail and snaps its sharp jaws to understand  how aggressive these creatures can be Among the  waterbeetles too though some such as the black  water beetle are vegetarians yet many are most  voracious and c ucl the true waterbeetlef Fig 88  which dives and swims so powerfully with its broad  hind legs and carries air under its closed wingcases  is one of the most greedy of water animals both as a  grub and beetle Not only does it devour the gruds  of mayflies dragonflies and other pond insects  but it feeds on snails tadpoles and fish taking  care however to burrow deep in the earth out of  the way when its helpless season comes lest some  of these creatures should return the compliment  This beetle is strong and powerful and looks like  a dangerous enemy but who would think that the  tiny bronzecoloured vhirligig beetles t which look so  bright as they dance on the top of the pond are  also voracious insect feeders Watch a group of  these bewildering little animals carefully and you  will see one here and one there dart up to catch  a passing fly or down rapidly to seize some  tiny water insect or to escape an enemy that is  approaching For in fact these beetles have an  unfair advantage in life having each of their eyes  divided in two parts one half looking down into the  pond below and the other half up into the air so  that they can literally keep half an eye upon any  suspicious creature in either element Theirs is a  life of many experiences for after beginning their  existence on the surface of waterplants where the  mother places the eggs they dive down as grubs to  the bottom of the pond breathing by hairy gills and  leaping actively here and there by four curious little  hooks on their tails feeding vigorously all the while  then they creep up into the air and spinning fine  cocoons upon the leaves of a waterplant remodel  their bodies and finally as tiny beetles they lead a  giddy life on the pondsurface darting here and  there as fancy guides them  But quick as these and many other water and  land beetles are both in catching and escaping other  animals it is a curious fact that it is among the  scavenger and filthfeeding beetles that we must look  for the highest intelligence these creatures possess  It is the dungfeeding beetle the sacred Scarabaeus  of the Egyptians which rolls up a ball of dung  with her hind legs and then sometimes alone some  times in company with another beetle which hopes  to share or steal the booty rolls the ball to a con  venient place and digging a hole by means of the  large spines on her front legs buries it and herself  with it so that she may feed upon it in safety  Then later on in the year she hollows out a closed  chamber and fills it with prepared dung in which to  lay her egg It is again among the carrion beetles  that we find the Sexton burying dead animals care  fully under the soil and then laying her eggs in them  The history of these sexton beetles is most extra  ordinary They hunt in couples male and female  often many couples together and wherever they find  a dead bird or mouse rat or frog they first feed till  they are satisfied and then drag the body to a soft  place in the ground Here the male beetles set to  work and with their strong heads dig a furrow all  round the animal then another and another till little  by little the carcass sinks down so that actually in  about twentyfour hours it is below the ground and  they can cover it with earth burying the mother  beetles with it Then the fathers too burrow down  and all is quiet and still but not for long for no  sooner has the mother beetle laid her eggs in the  dead body safe out of sight of all enemies than both  mother and father make their way out of the earth  and fly away Meanwhile the eggs left in the de  cayed body are soon hatched and the grubs feed for  three or four weeks and then each building a cell  lies down to undergo its change and comes out of  the earth a perfect sexton beetle  At first sight it seems almost impossible that  such small creatures can bury others so much larger  than themselves yet Miss Staveleyt a good authority  states that four of these beetles have been known to  bury in fifty days four frogs three small birds two  fishes one mole two grasshoppers the entrails of a  fish and two pieces of oxliver Which among us  works harder than this to provide food for the little  ones who come after us Or who can say that  these little beetles do not do their share of good in  the world when they clear away masses of decaying  matter which would poison the air burying it in the  best of all purifiers our mother earth  So feeding on plant or animal in the land or in  the water the beetles with their strongjointed legs  and powerful jaws make their way in life You  have only to watch a beetle forcing its way under a  clod of earth to see how powerful their muscles are  indeed it has been estimated that a cockchafer can  draw a weight fourteen times as heavy as itself  while the beebeetle can draw forty times its own  weight and many of the feats of beetle life beat  those of any athlete among men Yet we find that  they are not wanting in cunning too for who has  not seen the common skipjack beetle drop on the  ground when alarmed and drawing in its legs and  antennae lie on its back and pretend to be dead  till the danger is past and then with a sudden click  of its breastplate spring up in the air and come  down upon its legs But we must pass by many of  these curious histories such as that of the parasitic  beetles which introduce the eggs of their young into  the bees nest where they feed upon the honey and  of the blind beetles which live among the ants and  must even neglect the softskinned glowworms with  their phosphorescent light in the last three rings  of the abdomen and the beautiful fireflies of warm  tropical countries which are near relations of the  skipjack and have two bright shining spots upon  their shoulders We might trace out in the lives  of many of these beetle families the peculiar shape  of jaws les antennae and the peculiar colours of  their wingcases which fit them for the work they  have to do but such knowledge is the work of a  lifetime and at least a few words at the end of this  chapter must be given to the third group of animals  which remodel their bodies namely the t wo winged  flies and gnats  Does it not seem strange that while butterflies  and beetles dragonflies and grasshoppers and even  bees and wasps have all two pairs of wings yet our  common housefly and bluebottle in many other  ways so like bees have only one pair This how  ever will not seem quite so strange if you look care  fully just behind the wings of the fly for there you  will find on each side a little stalk with a knob at the  end which the creature uses to balance itself as it flies  These two stalks are the remains of the second pair of  wings which for some reason unknown to us must  have been a disadvantage to the ancestors of the fly  and this is all that remains of them If you cannot find  them easily in the fly where they are concealed under  some little winglets you will see them clearly in a  gnat or better still in a daddylonglegs in which  they are so distinct that you may examine them  without catching or hurting him by simply putting a  tumbler over him where he stands and slipping a  piece of paper underneath  These balancers tell us that the twowinged  flies the gnats mosquitoes midges bluebottles house  flies and cattleflies are not made on a different  plan from the fourwinged insects but are merely  flies whose hind wings have lost their size and power  while the front ones have become stronger and larger  This has evidently been no disadvantage in their  case for they have flourished well in the world and  myriads are to be found in every town and country  while their different ways of living are almost as  various as there are kinds of fly Some such as  the daddylonglegs suck the juices of plants some  suck animal blood some live on decaying matter  while in not a few cases as among the gadflies the  father is a peaceable sucker of honey while the mother  is bloodthirsty  Among the gnats and mosquitoes the father dies  so soon that he does not feed at all while the mother  has a mouth made of sharp lancets with which she  pierces the skin of her victim and then sucks up the  juices through the lips Among the botflies however  which are so much dreaded by horses and cattle it is  not with the mouth in feeding that the wound is  made In this case the mother has a scaly pointed  instrument in the tail which she thrusts into the  flesh of the animal so as to lay her eggs beneath its  skin where the young grub feeds and undergoes its  change into a fly  For we must remember that every fly we see has  had its young maggot life and its time of rest Our  common housefly was hatched in a dust heap or a  dung heap or among decaying vegetables and fed in  early life on far less tasty food than it finds in our  houses The bluebottle was hatched in a piece of  meat and fed there as a grub and the gadfly began  its life inside a horse its careful mother having placed  her eggs on some part of the horses body which he  was sure to lick and so to carry the young grub to  its natural warm home  But of all early lives that of the gnat is probably  the most romantic and certainly more pleasant than  those of most flies When the mother is ready to lay  her eggs she flies to the nearest quiet water and  there collecting the eggs together with her long hind  legs glues them into a little boatshaped mass and  leaves them to float In a very short time the eggs  are hatched and the young grubs swim briskly about  whirling round some tufts of hair which grow on  their mouths and so driving microscopic animals and  plants down their throats Curiously enough they  g Grub breathing air through the tube pupa breathing air  through two tubes t in the back b floating boat formed of the pupa  skin gn t gnat rising out of it above the perfect gnat is on the wing  These figures are all magnified to give clearness  all swim head downwards and tail upwards g Fig  90 and the secret of this is that they are airbreath  ing animals and have a small tube at the end of their  tail which they thrust above water to take in air  This goes on for about a fortnight when after they  have changed their skins three times they are ready  to remodel their bodies Then on casting their  skin for the fourth time they come out shorter and  bent and swathed up but still able to swim about  though not to eat Meanwhile a most curious change  has taken place The tail tube has gone and two  little tubes p t Fig 90 have grown on the top of the  back and through them the tiny pupa now draws in its  breath as it wanders along At last the time comes  for the gnat to come forth and the pupa stretches  itself out near the top of the water with its shoulders  a little raised out of it Then the skin begins to split  and the true head of the gnat appears and gradually  rises drawing up the body out of its case This is a  moment of extreme danger for if the boatlike skin  were to tip over it would carry the gnat with it  and in this way hundreds are drowned but if the  gnat can draw out its legs in safety the danger is  over Leaning down to the water he rests his tiny  feet upon it unfolds and dries his beautiful scale  covered wings and flies away in safety  With the gnat we must take our leave of the two  winged flies although if we could study their whole  history we should find them so intelligent that we  should not be surprised at Mr Lownes statement  that although a fly is not onefourth the size of a  beetle its brain is thirty times larger In fact it is  among these creatures which undergo metamorphosis  that we begin to reach a point of intelligence which  of its kind is quite as remarkable as that of the back  boned animals But it is not among the butterflies  beetles or even the twowinged flies that the highest  instincts are found There exists an immense order  called the Hymenoptera or membranewinged insects  hymen membrane pteron wing including the gall  flies sawflies ichneumons burrowers bees wasps and  ants in which instinct and intelligence exists to such  a great degree that all naturalists are lost in wonder  at the ingenuity of the wasp or the bee and the  almost incredible sagacity of the ant  And here comes a curious fact which we find  equally among the insects and the backboned animals  As Life endows her children with more intelligence  with quicker brains governing active bodies we find  them becoming more and more dependent upon  others in their infancy and youth Just as the large  and manlike orangoutang remains as helpless as a  human baby for the first few months of its life while  the lower and less intelligent monkeys have long  before that age begun to fight their own battles so  while the grubs of the frivolous butterfly the thought  less gnat and even the more intelligent sawfly are  active and can take care of themselves from the time  they come out of the egg the cellbuilding bee and  wasp on the contrary and the thoughtful contriving  ant have a real babyhood during which others watch  and tend them and when they must perish just as  a child would if it were not for the care and atten  tion of their grownup friends And this helplessness  of infancy increases with the intelligence of the  grownup creature as we shall see on reading the  next chapter For no one will deny that the ant  stands first in mental capacity among insects and its   For an amusing account of the difference between an orangoutang  baby and a young harelip monkey of about the same age see Wallaces  Malay Archipelago p 45  children are more helpless even than those of bees  A young bee eats its own food placed for it in its  cell but the ant can take nothing but what is actually  put into its mouth  It is most tempting to try and trace out this  gradual progress to increased intelligence in age and  helplessness in youth among the membranewinged  insects Thus we should begin with the caterpillars  of the sawflies placed within their proper plant by  the sawlike instrument of their mother and creeping  over it in their youth then pass on to the grubs of  the gallflies which lie helplessly within the gallnuts  eating the food which their mother has prepared for  them by leaving an irritating liquid which causes a  lump to grow up around them on the plant Next  would come the grubs of the cunning Ichnuemon fly  which though feeding on honey herself pierces the  skin of the caterpillar or the beetle and leaves her  eggs in their flesh where the young ones live as  parasites during their sluggish infancy  From these we should go on to the still more  wonderful burrowing insects such as the Cerceris the  Sphex and the Sandwasp which after laying their  eggs in a hole pierce beetles grasshoppers or cater  pillars with their sting not killing them but paralysing  them and then storing them up with their eggs as  fresh healthy living food for the young when they are  hatched two or three weeks later Then we should  come to the true wasps with their beautifullycon  structed paper nests built of wood fibre moulded into  paste and their helpless infants each in its cell tended  with the utmost care and we should learn almost  to have an affection for these industrious creatures  which in some ways show even greater intelligence  than the bees Then these last would claim our  attention with their frugal habits their industry in  storing up honey their wonderful cities in which  each citizen has his duty and their love for their  queen And lastly we arrive at the ants and to  these we must devote the next chapter since to  speak of the others would need a whole book and  the bees we have dealt with elsewhere In the ants  we shall find that life has worked out her masterpiece  among insects and in them we can best learn to  understand how far we have travelled since we started  with the Amceba passing gradually from mere living  feeding and dying atoms of life to active intelligent  beings whose life depends quite as much and even  more upon the inward work of the brain than upon  the outer weapons of the body  CHAPTER XII INTELLIGENT INSECTS WITH HELPLESS CHILDREN  AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE ANTS  So when the emmets an industrious train  Embodied rob some golden heap of grain  Studious ere stormy winter frowns to lay  Safe in their darksome cells the treasured prey  In one long track the dusky legions lead  Their prize in triumph through the verdant mead  Here bending with the load a panting throng  With force conjoined heave some huge grain along  Some lash the stragglers to the task assigned  Some to their ranks the bands that lag behind  They crowd the peopled path in thick array  Glow at the work and darken all the way  VIRGIL  DARE engage said the King of  Brobdingnag as he took Gulliver  on the palm of his right hand and  stroked him gently while his learned  men examined this strange pigmy  through their magnifying glasses   I dare engage that these diminu  tive creatures have their titles and  distinctions of honour they con  trive little nests and burrows which  they call houses and cities they  make a figure and dress in equi  page they love they fight they  dispute they cheat they betray  Now Gulliver was a man made in the same  fashion as the Brobdingnagian king only in smaller  proportions and therefore it was not so wonderful  that the king should suppose him to be living a life  like his own But the little ant which we may take  in like manner on our hand is fashioned quite differ  ently from ourselves and is only an insect and yet  strange to say almost all the things asserted of Gul  liver and many more which seem almost human  may be said with truth about these tiny creatures  For ants make nests and burrows which are real  houses and cities and even clear roadways to and  from their settlements If they do not dress in  equipage they perform their toilet with the greatest  care as well as that of their friends and of the help  less infants of their city They can dispute and  hold communication with their fellows they fight  both singly and in well disciplined armies they  betray in some cases their fellow ants and carry  them into slavery they keep domestic animals  having beetles and other insects living in their nests  as we have dogs and cats in our houses and some  of them provide food for their community by keeping  herds of Aphides as we keep cows Moreover they  form very large societies such as can only succeed  by all the members working together in harmony  In one ants nest made up of several separate homes  there maybe from 50000 to 200000 ants and though  each ant is free to build or hunt or milk or fight  or go where she will it seems to create no confusion  In this way they are much more independent than  bees and wasps whose combs are all built mechani  cally one exactly like the other whereas any ant  may start a gallery or chamber in a new direction  and others soon joining her will add fresh nurseries  and homes to the nest according to their own ideas  Yet there is order in this vast multitude Some  invisible bond makes each and all labour for the  good of the whole and this is the more curious as  there is no special leader or governor among them  In all complicated work which has to be done the  feeding of the queenmother the nursing carrying  and feeding of the young the building of new  chambers the tending of their flocks and herds the  defence of the nest or the formation of new colonies  all labour amicably together without any apparent  government and yet without confusion or disorder  Now before we can understand how it is that  these little insects have advanced so far beyond  others of their class we must first inquire what are  the chief weapons with which life has provided them  and to what use they are put Although ants are  such common insects that there is scarcely a garden  without them and even many of our houses are  overrun by them yet probably very few people have  ever examined one carefully or tried to understand  its very peculiar shape and if you can catch one  wandering about the garden or feeding in the store  cupboard and put it under a magnifying glass you  will be astonished to find how much there is to learn  about it  First notice the ringed abdomen common to all  insects and the very fine stalk by which it is joined  to the rest of the body allowing it to bend easily in  all directions If you have taken the gardenant  this stalk will be made of one knob or ring as it is  also in the hillant F Fig 91 while if you have  the tiny reddishyellow houseant t M there will be  two knobs and by this you may know at once that  the houseant has a sting while the garden one has  not for in England all the ants with one knob ex  cept one single genus have no sting Next notice  the threeringed thorax bearing the six legs On  each side of this are three breathing holes which  however you cannot see without a very strong lens  But even with the naked eye you may discover the  tiny spur s F Fig 91 which sticks out from the  third joint of each leg and a magnifying glass will  show that this spur on the two front legs is larger than  on the others and bears on its edge more than fifty  five elastic teeth c Fig 9 2 while another set of similar  teeth on the leg itself Ic face it and can be rubbed  up against it These are the toiletbrush and comb  of the ant and when  ever she has been  doing any dirty work  she will pause and  use them to brush off  the dust or mud  which has clung to  the delicate hairs and  bristles of her body  Then she will after  wards pass the brush  and comb through  her mandibles and so Head eet eyes  It is however the  head of the ant which is above all remarkable  You will be struck at once with its curious  triangular shape its large size and its flatness while  the small eyes e Fig 92 and the antennae a  bent like the elbow of an arm are very different  from what we have seen in other insects It seems  strange at first that active intelligent creatures like  ants should have such small eyes as many of them  have and still more so that the eyes of the workers  should be smaller than those of the males and females  which do no work But when we remember the  blind Termites p 225 and how they build intricate  homes without any eyes at all we are prepared to  find that it is the antennae which are chiefly used by  ants to guide them in their work  What the true history of these antennae is and  how the ants communicate by means of them we  shall probably never know for though it is almost  certain that they use them for feeling and smelling  and perhaps even for hearing yet there seems to be  some other sense in them by which one ant can tell  another of danger or food or work to be done  For instance Sir J Lubbock who is unwearying  in making careful and accurate observations on the  habits of ants has lately tried the experiment of  pinning a fly or a spider to the ground so that the  ant which found it could not drag it away On  nearly all occasions the ant returning to the nest  brought friends to help her seven twelve and in  one case fifteen came and as she did not carry any  thing with her to show that she had found a prize  it is almost certain that she must have told them of  it in some way The ants which she brought often  came slowly and reluctantly wandering hither and  thither so as to be halfanhour in reaching the dead  insect and once the first ant growing impatient  started off again to the nest and brought a second  body of recruits who after most persevering efforts  carried off the spider piecemeal These ants then  had some means of telling the other ants that they  wanted help and how much they wanted and numer  ous observations show that it is by touching their an  tennae that they make these communications Now  though at first this may appear almost incredible yet  if we think for a moment we shall acknowledge that  it would seem still more strange to a being who  knew nothing about speech to see two men stand  at a distance from each other and only move their  mouths and then go and do something which showed  that one knew what the other wanted so that it may  after all be only our ignorance of antlanguage which  puzzles us  Next to the antennas the most useful implements  of an ant are her mandibles in ni which do the  greater part of the work to which the antennae guide  them Looking in the face of an ant you see these  two outer jaws with their toothed edges resting against  each other but if you make her angry she will open  them wide to seize you with all her tiny might  Does she want to excavate a gallery Then she  will tear out the earth with these toothed spades and  carry it in pellets above ground Is she cleaning a  cocoon She will then use her mandibles tenderly  and neatly to pick out morsels of dirt and afterwards  will lift the tiny ball with them and carry it without  injury up or down the nest Or she may perhaps be  cutting a blade of grass to lay as a rafter in the roof  of a chamber again she saws off the leaf with her  mandibles while she holds it with her front legs Or  lastly if she is fighting to the death in a pitched  battle she will fix these strong pincers so firmly in  the throat of her enemy that even if she is killed  her head will often remain for days hanging on to  the conquerors body  There is however one thing she does not do with  her mandibles she does not chew with them but  uses them to tear and press the food so as to obtain  the juices and ojls in it It is true many ants feed  upon other insects and even on grains but in the  first case they pierce the skin with the mandibles  and then lap up the liquid within and the seeds they  tear to fragments and lick or rasp off the starch with  their tiny tongue Fig 92 helped by the inner jaws  C7  Such then is roughly the structure of the working  ant which is an imperfect female and when we ask  how it is that so small a creature with a body not  onetenth part as strong as many of the beetles and  without the power of flying has made its way so well  in the world we learn that within that curious  shaped head is collected a larger and more complex  mass of nervematter than in other insects so that in  the two large hemispheres of an ants brain life has  prepared a powerful machine for guiding the little  creature on its road In all social insects such as  the bees and wasps the nervemasses in the brain  are larger than in those insects which do their work  alone and one great secret of the success of ants  is that they form the most perfect societies in the  whole animal world  And now how shall we study antlife For  there are as many different races of ants each with  its special habits and customs as there are races  of men and one description will by no means do  for them all The best way will be to speak first  of some one race well known to all of us and then  to say something of others It would seem most  natural to take the little garden ant which is the  one we most often come across But it lives a  great part of its time underground and though it  comes to the surface to sun itself and wander about  it does not do much work above ground except  when it is visiting its cows see p 287 It will be  better therefore to take another common ant the  hill ant or horse ant as it is often called which  lives a more outdoor life  You can scarcely walk through any English wood  without coming across lines of these reddishlooking  ants which are often of very different sizes and have  for ants rather large eyes Their nests are easily  found forming large leafy hillocks at the foot of oak  trees or sometimes in the open ground Even in  England they are often two feet high and on the  Continent they are much larger At an early hour  in the morning all will be still and quiet on these  hillocks for the ants close their doors at night with  leaves or bits of stick and straw but as soon as  the sun rises and flings its beams across the leafy  wood warming the air you may see a few ants  creep out of cracks in the dome and by and by  if the day be fine many large openings will be made  and soon all is alive and active Some ants are  dragging in bits of wood and straw and leaves to  add to the dome others are carrying in bits of insects  young grasshoppers or worms or caterpillars whose  juices they will feed upon in the nest others creep  into the blossoms of plants to steal their honey while  others again seek out the stems covered with aphides  or plantlice and beg of them their sweet juice  It will be remembered see p 203 that the  aphides plunge their trunks into plants and suck all  day long filling their bodies with juice Now when  the ant comes running up the stem in search of  food she comes behind the aphis and strokes it  gently with her antennae and the little creature  gives out from the end of its body or sometimes from  the little horns a drop of sweet liquid which the  ant licks up and it is probable that this is pleasant  to the aphis which in any case always gives out  juice from time to time The ant on her side pro  tects these plantlice keeping off the ladybirds or  other insects which might attack them and even  taking care that for a certain distance round her  own nest no ant from a strange community shall  poach upon her grounds  And now as these wellfed ants with their crops  filled with two or three drops of aphis juice hurry  home again they meet with others those that have  been collecting leaves or those which have been  sweeping out the galleries of the nest and have had  no time to get food These hungry ants run up to the  fullfed ones and stroke them with their antennas  asking for food and then lifting up their mouth they  receive the juice which the others squeeze out of  their crop for one of the principal rules in antcities  is for every member to help another for the general  good  Busy however as every one seems to be outside  the nest they are still busier within If you could cut  one of these anthills in half downwards you would  find that the nest extends often a foot or more into  the earth and everywhere it is a maze of narrow  galleries leading into rooms with vaulted ceilings  see Fig 93 In the top part of the nest made  chiefly of sticks and leaves together with dried seeds  and often little stones and shells these galleries  appear very confused though with a little care they  may be traced by the tiny beams of wood and the  blades of grass and leaves forming the rafters of the  ceilings but down below where the ground is firm  though still mixed with other material the roads are  clearer and the chambers larger  Here active busy work is going on Deep down  almost at the bottom of the nest the queenant is  wandering about with her train of followers dropping  tiny eggs as she goes which the workers pick up  and arrange in little heaps in the chambers In  other apartments are packets of eggs many days  old and these are being licked all over and carried  several at a time by the workers up into higher cham  bers where the air is warmed by the morning sun  Again in other chambers are heaps of little white  legless blind grubs with twelve soft rings to their  bodies Fig pi Fig 9 3 and narrow mouths with  soft mouthpieces ending in a pointed lip These  little helpless creatures can do no more than just  turn their heads to receive the drops of food which  the nurses squeeze out of their crops down the infant  throats They are spotlessly clean for they too  are licked all over daily and every speck of dirt is  picked off by the mandibles of the worker ants  which not only feed and clean them but carry them  as they did the eggs up for warmth in the day and  down at night to escape the chilly air Sir John  Lubbock has observed that these grubs are sometimes  even sorted and arranged in groups according to  their size and age for they live and grow in this  state for various periods according to the time of year  and sometimes remain as grubs for many months  In another chamber quite a different process is  going on for here the grubs have arrived at the  time when they are ready to remodel their bodies  and each little grub moving his head to and fro is  laying down silken threads within which he spins  his soft cocoon Still here also the workers are  busy for as soon as each cocoon is finished they  loosen the outer threads clinging to the earth and  smooth and clean the cocoon till it is a pure oval  ball which they can carry up and down in the nest  though they can no longer feed the little creature  within It is these cocoons c Fig 93 which people  mistake for eggs when they see the ants hurrying  away with them when their nest is disturbed for  the nurses guard their sleeping children with zealous  care and many a workerant has died sooner than  leave a grub or a cocoon in the hands of an enemy  Lastly in other chambers the final act of the baby  ants history is being carried on for after clean  ing and carrying and watching over the cocoons till  the perfect ant is ready to come forth the workers  have still to help it out of its silken prison This  they do by tearing the cocoon gently with their  mandibles two or three of them at a time Then  carefully drawing the ant out of the hole and licking  it all over to clear it of its pupa skin they feed it  and leave it to go to its work which for some little  time will be all within the nest till its coat has be  come hard and firm and its limbs strong When  once it is grown up it may live through many seasons  for Sir J Lubbock tells me that he has ants which  have lived in his room since 1874 and they must  therefore be now at least six and probably seven  years old  All this different work of nursing and feeding  may be going on at one time in a nest some  times in different chambers sometimes pellmell  eggs grubs cocoons and young ants all in the  same room But this is not all which the workers  have to do for if it be summer time a number of  winged ants will be wandering about which have  also to be cared for These are the male ants and  the young females which have not yet begun to lay  eggs They have come out of cocoons rather different  in size and shape from those of the wingless worker  ants and we do not yet know what decides this  difference There is no jealousy in an ants nest  as there is in a beehive between the queenmother  and the young princesses indeed in some nests several  queen mothers live amicably together But still  the workers have to feed and watch all these winged  ants and though the young princesses are allowed  to go outside on the dome of the nest and sun them  selves the workers never leave them and towards  evening may be seen taking hold of them by the  mandibles and dragging them gently home to bed  By and by later in the year all these winged ants  will come out of the nest in a swarm and rise and  fall in the air like the Mayflies over the pond Then  the males will never return to the nest but will  wander about and soon die or be devoured in num  bers by birds or other insects The same thing  will happen to many of the princesses but some will  be seized by the workers and dragged back to the  nest where their wings are pulled off and they settle  down into queens and lay eggs Others which have  fallen at a distance will pull off their own wings  which are fastened very lightly to their shoulders  and will begin to dig a hole and lay eggs in the  earth Whether these solitary queens are able to  found a new nest or whether it is only when two or  three workers join them that they live and flourish  is not yet certain but Sir John Lubbock has shown  that in one case at any rate a queen which he kept  artificially Myrmica ruginodis did bring up some  young workers from her eggs  There is another way however in which new  nests begin and this is when an old nest is over full  or when the leaves and sticks begin to decay and  the carcasses of insects and of dead ants which have  been thrown out of the nest make the home un  healthy In either of these cases some worker sets  off and finds a spot for a new nest this found she  comes back and seizing another ant in her mandibles  carries her off to the chosen place These two again  return each carrying another and so a little band of  workers is collected  Then they set to work One ant begins to dig a  hole with her front legs throwing out the dirt behind  much as a dog does another and another follow in  her train and the work goes on merrily while others  are still going to and fro to the old nest and carry  ing in new recruits As soon as the tunnel becomes  too deep for the earth to be kicked out the exca  vators bite out pieces with their mandibles and carry  them in little pellets outside the hole to form the  upper part of the nest Meanwhile others are fetch  ing sticks and leaves to prop up the galleries and  roof the chambers and so the dome rises above as  the firmer part of the nest is being scooped out below  And now the migration goes on apace no ant  seems to leave the old nest willingly but as soon as  she is carried to the new one the general enthusiasm  seizes upon her and she sets to work to dig and  build or runs back to carry another as eagerly as  any of those that have been long at work In this  way a complete train of ants going and coming are  to be seen those which are emptymouthed going  back to the old nest the others each with her burden  going to the new one M Forel once counted from  forty to fifty in a minute passing each way so that  36000 newcomers would be carried in one day  At first it is only workers that are brought but  when chambers are prepared then the eggs larvae  and cocoons princesses males and queens are all  carried to the new home and the migration is com  plete  The next step if the community be large is to  clear roads to the nearest plants where aphides may  be found and to do this the workers carry away  dead leaves and refuse matter and saw off the living  blades of grass and soon lay bare a narrow path  along which they travel in search of food Now  while all this is going on it will often appear as it  any one ant was wasting a great deal of time running  hither and thither in an aimless kind of way But  it must be remembered that ants see but a very short  distance and that it is by means of their antennae  and probably chiefly by scent that they find their  way Moreover the blades of grass among which  they are moving are to them like tall trees so that  we must look upon them as travellers in pathless  woods following a track and not expect them to go  direct to their point Many too will seem to stand  idle while others look as if they were merely playing  together This is because they not only rest from  time to time but are very particular to clean their  bodies carefully from the earth which clings to them  and when they appear to be playing together one ant  is often performing this kind office for another Still  in spite of wandering and resting and cleaning them  selves it is marvellous what an amount of work  these little creatures do so that in a short time their  new domain is adapted for their life  It may happen however that all does not go  so smoothly the new colony may chance to en  croach upon the territory of some other ants nest  and then comes dire disaster for no two nations can  fight more relentlessly for a province or a frontier  than these little ants do for their plots of ground  No sooner does one community find that another  is taking possession of any part of its domain or  has given offence in some way unintelligible to us  than the workers pour out by thousands marching  close together in battle array eager for the attack  Meanwhile those belonging to the other side advance  to defend themselves and when the two armies meet  they fall upon each other two by two taking hold  with their mandibles and raising themselves up on  their hind legs so that they can turn the abdomen  under the body This is in order that they may  squirt out from the tail that strong acid called formic  add which acts as a poison so that often the com  batants fall dead locked in each others arms When  ever these ants are excited the scent of formic acid  is very strong so that you may smell it in passing  the nest  If one ant succeeds in disabling the other remain  ing unhurt herself she tries to drag her victim off to  the nest there to be killed and devoured Now  although all these ants are exactly alike each army  knows its own followers and it is very rarely indeed  that a friend is attacked If this does happen the  onslaught is almost instantly changed to a caress and  the two friends turn against a common enemy At  night each army returns home but at daybreak the  battle begins again and may rage for many days till  either the inhabitants of one nest are destroyed or  routed or bad weather puts an end to the fighting  And when the war is over the dead and mangled  are not left on the field for these terrible cannibals  carry them off to their nests to suck the juices from  their bodies  Such are the battles of the hill ants but the  mode of attack is very various among the different  races The red ant see p 277 for example is  much more wily and given to stratagem and does  not fight in such large masses Again there are  tiny ants which when attacked by larger ones hang  on the legs and jump upon their backs biting them  and tearing them to pieces while the larger ant tries  to strangle them in her mandibles One particular  slavemaking ant has especially pointed mandibles  and she drives them right into the brain of her  enemy throwing her into convulsions and paralysing  her On the other hand those ants which have  stings make use of them in fighting rather than of  their mandibles while as we have seen the hillant  is remarkable for the force with which she can squirt  out formic acid over her adversary  But in whatever way they are carried on these  antbattles are fierce and bitter for ants have very  few enemies but those of their own kind so that  they swarm everywhere and have great struggles for  their homes and their flocks of aphides Indeed  among ants as among uncivilised human races each  member is faithful to his tribe and bitterly hostile to  any stranger Sir J Lubbock has found that after  a separation of fifteen months an ant belonging to  the nest was recognised and welcomed while a  stranger was hustled and turned away and what  is still more curious when ant eggs were taken to  another nest and the young ones hatched there and  brought up by strange nurses yet their own people  recognised and received them when they were re  turned to their home  The little black ant of our gardens has learnt a  cunning way of keeping out of the way of quarrels by  hiding her honeycows Instead of going out to seek  them every day she carries them home and keeps  them close to her nest where she sometimes surrounds  the stem on which they live with a tube of earth or  visits them by covered galleries or even puts them on  the roots of plants underground in her own home  You may discover this little ant climbing the plants  and tempting the aphides to give out their sweet  drops and by carefully digging up the plants near  her nest you may find the plantlice clinging to the  roots which run through her galleries and her cham  bers Only it may be well to put them back again  to their industrious keepers and you will probably be  rewarded by seeing the ants take them up and carry  them down for safety to a lower part of the nest  The small yellow meadowant keeps her aphides  entirely on the roots of plants fetching and placing  them near to her nest and tending them with the  greatest care even watching over their little black  eggs so as to secure fresh broods In this way she  rarely needs to come above ground and has no  regular openings to her nest  Now when these ants are attacked they do not  come out of their nest to fight on the contrary  they defend it like a fortress hiding themselves in  the lower galleries barring the way with pellets of  earth and disputing every inch with the enemy  Indeed if the struggle becomes very hopeless they  will escape with their cocoons and grubs along their  labyrinth of passages and closing up the road will  raise a new anthill at some distance from the first  These ants work at their nests by night for as they  build entirely with earth they need the damp and dew  to moisten the pellets as they plaster their walls  The ants we have mentioned the hillant and the  meadowant have workers of very different sizes and  there is very little doubt that the larger workers do  most of the fighting indeed in South Europe and  America there are in some species special large  headed workers which are the soldiers of the commu  nity But if you will search carefully in the banks  of the fir woods or in the stumps of the decayed trees  of Hampshire Surrey or Sussex you may chance to  come across a much more curious sight than mere  difference of size for you will find large red ants  and smaller black ones t living in one nest and  working happily together  Yet these black ants were not born among the  red ones their eggs were laid by their own black  mother in the nest at home and they were stolen  the summer before some time between the months  of June and August when they were lying wrapped  up in their cocoons by an army of red ants which  attacked the nest in which they lay  The first alarm was probably given by the appear  ance of a few scouts wandering round the nest and  as soon as the black ants saw them there was terrible  consternation Some swarmed out to face the enemy  others rushed to seize the eggs grubs and cocoons  to carry them to the other side of the nest for  safety where the princesses followed them while  others blocked up the doors to defend the fortress  Meanwhile the red army kept growing in numbers  more and more ants crowding round the poor black  ant city till a semicircle of hundreds of warriors  was formed all standing with their antennae thrown  back and their mandibles wide open Then the  attack began the black ants fought bravely clinging  to the legs of their cruel foes biting them and  striving to drive them off and to bear their little  ones away in safety In vain overcome by the  strength and number of their assailants they had  to give way and soon the conquerors were swarming  over the dead bodies of the defenders and carrying  off their cocoons  From this moment the red ants did not attempt  to fight except with those of the black ones  which tried to escape with their young They  hurried past all the others pushing them aside and  occupied themselves entirely in making their way  into the galleries out of which each red ant came  with her stolen treasure in her mouth and set off  with it at once to her own nest In this way the  whole red army travelled to and fro carrying away  cocoon after cocoon and delivering them over to the  care of other black ants in the nest at home which  had been captured in the same way the year before  and had now settled down as nurses of the establish  ment These ants took the cocoons and watched  and tended them and by and by when they were  opened the black children took to the redant nest  as their home and worked with the rest Except  that they are forcibly seized in their infancy these  black ants can scarcely be called slaves for master  and servant live together like equals only that the  black ants generally remain more indoors while the  red ones go out to seek food  But how have these red ants which are in many  ways some of the cleverest of their kind learnt to  steal young black ones to help them in their  work Mr Darwin suggests the answer It is a  common practice with ants to carry the cocoons  of their enemies into their nests to eat them and  they tear open the cocoon to feed on the insect  within Now nothing is more likely than that  some of the black ant cocoons thus carried in  should be neglected till the ants within them were  perfect and then when they came out active and  vigorous they would be well received as ants born  in the nest generally are and would mix with the  red ones and prove very useful Is it too much  to imagine that thus by degrees the intelligent red  ants should come to understand that it was better to  have the help of the black ants than to eat them  and should learn to fetch them in numbers to help  them in their work One thing is certain that they  know their own interest now for if by chance a  female winged ant comes out of the stolen cocoons  she is killed at once by her red masters who know  that if she lived and laid eggs these would be tended  by the slaves and the nest would soon become a  blackant city  But now see how true it is even among insects  that those who always look to others to save them  trouble become weak useless and contemptible for  though the slave making ants which we have in  England work with their slaves there are others  living abroadt which have become so dependent  upon their black servants that they can neither build  their nests nor tend their young nor even feed them  sjlves It is a mockery to call the neuters of these  ants workers for they can do no work any more  than the males and females but they are soldiers  for the one thing they can do is to go in great  hordes and fight the black ants and steal their  cocoons Here their pointed mandibles which have  lost their toothed edge and are of no use for other  work come into play as deadly weapons in crushing  the brains of their enemies see p 286 and their  warlike expeditions are bold and successful For  the rest they are quite helpless it is the negro ants  which fetch provisions feed the grubs take care  of the princesses build the rooms and galleries and  even feed their lazy masters Huber once took  thirty of these red ants with their grubs and cocoons  and put them in a box with a supply of honey but  though the food lay close to them they made no  attempt to eat and many died At last taking pity  on them he put one little negro ant into the box  and at once she set to work made a chamber in the  earth fed the grubs attended to the cocoons and  even saved the lives of those few fullgrown red  ants which remained Sir J Lubbock has lately  repeated this experiment keeping one of these red  ants alive for months by putting in a slave for two  or three hours a day to clean and feed it  Even when it is necessary to migrate to a new  nest these red ants will not trouble themselves to  walk there but lie on their backs and are carried by  the faithful blacks who never seem to lose their  temper or to mind the work which falls upon them  The only time that we ever hear of the blacks being  angry was once when Huber saw the red ants return  from a slavemaking expedition without any cocoons  This was too much that the only one thing they ever  did for the community should be neglected The  exasperated slaves hustled them and dragged them  out of the nest again but after a few moments re  lented and allowed them to come home  And now from ants degraded by indolence let  us turn to those which have become so industrious  as even to lay up stores for the future Our English  ants being in a cold climate sleep through the winter  deep down in their lower chambers and in this way  have no need of food though the yellow meadow ants  show great forethought according to Sir J Lubbock  by carrying aphides eggs down into their nest early  in October and tending them with the utmost care so  as to secure a crop of young ones which they bring  out the next March and place on the daisy stalks  which are their natural home In warm countries  however such as the shores of the Mediterranean and  the Southern States of North America there is no  chilling influence to make the ants hibernate while  at the same time for some part of the year they  cannot find their accustomed food in the fields and  meadows And so in these warm countries it comes  to pass that the ant provideth her meat in the sum  mer and gathereth her food in the harvest although  many writers have denied the truth of this because  they had only studied the ants of colder countries  It was among the lemon terraces of the warm  sheltered valley of Mentone that Mr Traherne  Moggridge during the last years of an invalid life  set himself to watch these little harvesters which all  belong to the twoknobbed ants see p 271 There  they were to be found in the early spring as soon  as any seeds were ripe hard at work on the rough  slope of the terrace tearing off the seedvessels of  the Shepherds Purse and the Chickweed and plun  dering Peaflowers Honeyworts and grasses of their  seeds and then carrying them in their mandibles to  the nest Sometimes a young and foolish ant  brought in rubbish and not a few were deceived by  some small white beads strewn by Mr Moggridge on  the path But these no sooner reached the nest than  they were hustled out by their elders to throw the  useless burden away so that in a very short time  they all learnt to leave the beads alone  Meanwhile another set of workers within the  antcity were busy stripping off the husks of the seeds  and casting them out of the nest and as in many  cases whole seeds are either thrown out by mistake  or dropped on their way in one of these ants nests  may be found by noticing the little crop of oats  chickweed and other grasses which spring up round  the refuseheap  By cutting a nest open or taking a good piece  out of it with a trowel the little granaries in which  these seeds are stored may be laid bare They are  about the size of a gentlemans gold watch and  are connected by narrow galleries It is a curious  fact that though these seeds grow easily when they  are sown yet in the granaries it is very rare to find  one sprouting This is probably owing to the care  which the ants take to keep them dry making the  roof and sides of the granaries firm and hard and  bringing the seeds out on a warm day and spreading  them round the nest so that any moisture is drawn  out of them Mr Moggridge even saw the ants  after a shower of rain had made the seed germinate  bite off the point of the little root which was begin  ning to show itself  In this way the ants store up seeds in the summer  having often a large series of galleries and granaries  so that from half a pint to a pint of seeds has been  taken from one nest and in the winter when food  is scarce the starch in these seeds supplies them with  nourishment  And now one vexed question still remains have  these clever little insects yet learnt to sow seeds as  well as to gather them This still remains to be  proved but if we travel to Texas we find that one  thing is certain namely that they have learnt to  ANTS AND THEIR HELPLESS CHILDREN 295  clear the ground round their nests even among the  toughest grass and to allow nothing to spring up on  these cleared disks except the needle grass or ant  rice which they store up in their granaries  We have already seen that the English hillant  will clear a path but what labour it must be to clear  and keep clear round spaces measuring from seven  Cleared disk of the agricultural ant with a central mound and  seven roads MCook  to twelve feet across on wild meadow ground covered  with rank weeds two or three feet high some of them  having stems as thick as ones finger Yet this is  done by the agricultural or bearded ants t of Texas  which swarm in such numbers and clear so many  spaces that they actually injure the farms on which  they establish themselves They keep the circular  space round their nests perfectly clean never allowing  a weed to encroach upon it except where at the  edges crops of needle grass grow of which they  harvest the seed Underground their galleries and  chambers often extend under the whole disk and  there can be little doubt that it is chiefly in order to  get air and ventilation about which they are very  particular that they clear the weeds away But  their work does not end here for they make from  three to seven roads according to the size of the  nest branching out into the forest of grasses so that  they can go far afield to collect seeds These roads  are often more than fifty feet long and it sounds  strangely like our own country places when we hear  that they grow weedy in the winter when little used  and are cleared afresh in the spring  When we think however of the small size of the  ants in comparison with the vegetation they have to  destroy the history becomes much more astonishing  Many of the larger and thicker grass stems which  they saw through with their mandibles to clear their  disk must be to them like the trunks of trees measur  ing six feet across while the round spaces they keep  clear are in relation to their size equal to a piece of  country a quarter of a mile in diameter  These ants make their nests entirely underground  only sometimes having a small dome see Fig 94  with one or two openings in the top Their granaries  are very large and yet they are not entirely vege  tarians for Mr M c Cook saw them laying in a com  plete store of male and female termites which fell  round their nest after swarming  Central America can however boast of at least  one purely vegetarian ant namely the leafcutting  ant These active little creatures devastate whole  forests by tearing the leaves with their mandibles  and carrying off pieces about the size of a sixpence  into their nest and Mr Beltf found that these  leaves are probably used for manure upon which  a minute fungus grows inside the nest and forms  the ant food These ants are decidedly clever  for when they were changing their nests once and  had to get their cocoons down a slope Mr Belt saw  one set of workers bring them to the top and roll  them down while another set picked them up at the  bottom Another ant which is housed and fed in  a most peculiar manner inhabits the Bulls horn  thorntree This ant lives in the hollow thorns of  the tree sipping the honey which exudes from a  gland at the base of the leaves and in return as it  stings terribly it protects its friend the tree from the  attacks of the leafcutting ant  The foraging or army ants of Central America  on the other hand subsist entirely on insects and  other animal food and travel in great hordes from  place to place clearing the country as they go and  living in hollow trees and fallen trunks on their road  Cockroaches crickets spiders locusts wood lice  centipedes and scorpions all fall a prey to this huge  moving army often three or four yards wide and  the natives call it the blessing of God because  the ants swarm into their houses and by the time  they leave every insect is cleared away The army  consists not only of dark workers and soldiers with  enormous heads and powerful jaws but nas also at  intervals of about two or three yards lightcoloured  officers which touch the ants with their antennae  and seem to give the orders directing the march  So the column moves on each ant probably guided  chiefly by scent and the other senses of its antennae  for these ants are almost and sometimes entirely  blind Scouts are sent out on all sides to bring  intelligence of booty and the army swarms to the  right or the left according to information given  following the scent of their comrades  And now we must take leave of these intelli  gent little beings though we have not even glanced  at many of their curious habits such for example  as the storing up of honey in the abdomen of ants  hanging from the roof of the nest as is practised by  the Mexican honey ant But we have learnt enough  to be convinced of their intelligence and it only  remains to inquire whether amongst all their work  they have any feeling of sympathy for each other  The truth is they seem to care for the members of  their own nest but more as parts of the community  than as individuals There are many cases in which  ants have gone to help a comrade but this is gener  ally though not always when she is still able to  share in their work as for example when Mr Belt  tells us that the foraging ants never rested till they  had released a comrade which he had covered over  with a lump of clay Sir J Lubbock it is true  gives one case of a poor ant born without antennae  which was roughly handled by some enemies and  was afterwards most carefully carried home by  a friend But these incidents seem rare and upon  the whole the great guiding principle in ant life  appears to be devotion to the community much more  than to each other With them the mother has no  interest in her children after they are born and the  workers take care of all alike so that no special  ties of affection are formed and while we admire  the wonderful mechanism of antlife we must not  expect to find in it that love and personal devotion  which is developed in quite another branch of Lifes  children  We have travelled far since we started with the  shapeless and sluggish Amceba and have surely  justified the statement with which we began that by  giving the prize of success to those who best fight  the battle of existence Life educates her children to  fill their place in the world  Much as we admire the tiny limebuilders and  their beautiful shells we must confess that the slime  animal itself is a frail and helpless being with but  feeble enjoyment of life and the first advance which  we perceive in the sponges is one rather of architec  ture than of individual existence But in the lasso  throwers we already begin to detect the rudiments  of those senses which afterwards become so keen  the nerves eyes and ears of the jellyfish enable it  at least to begin to appreciate the world around it  and to live a free and independent life In the star  fish and his companions we advance still further  Here is movement by walking as well as by swim  ming a keen eye keeps a lookout on all things  around a battery of nerves complicated muscles  and other parts give a far more distinct individuality  and glimmerings of intelligence to the pricklyskinned  animals than to the floating jelly driven hither and  thither by the currents of the sea In fact these  creatures stand at the head of a small but peculiar  branch of lifes children while we have had to travel  along another road to reach higher intelligence  This road led us from the oyster so low in percep  tion yet so perfect in his internal mechanism through  a long chain of beings to the cunning octopus and  cuttlefish Here we have the quick eye the rapid  movement and the power of adapting things to the  benefit of the animal as when the little Sepiola blows  a hole in the sand and arranges the stones round  his body we have the quick instinct of selfdefence  directing the inky fluid against an enemy the capa  city for changing colour for protection or attack and  the maternal care of the eggs In a word we arrive  here at the head of one great division specially  adapted for marine life though some of its forms  gain a footing upon the land Still this division is  incapable so far as we can see of advancing into  successful competition with yet higher forms which  arising in the dim past almost from the same centre  as these mollusca have branched out on sea and  land into crustaceans and insects We need scarcely  follow this branch through its ramifications for the  past chapters have shown the gradual progress of  intelligence accompanying concentration of nervous  power till we arrive at foresight prudence and or  ganisation among the ants  Still we must feel that something is wanting and  that something is mutual sympathy and help between  any two beings independently of mere duty as citi  zens This we shall not find to any extent among  the invertebrata or animals without back bones which  are those we have dealt with in this book Among  the higher mollusca we find something like maternal  care in the cuttlefish and the scorpion and earwig  care for their young But even among insects the  large majority never live to see their children born  and those which do generally leave the care of them  to others We must turn for the development of  fuller sympathy to that other branch the keynote of  whose existence is the relation of parents to child  ren of family love If at a future time we are able  to trace out the history of the vertebrate animals it  will be our great interest to watch the rise of this  higher feeling Then we may perhaps learn that  the struggle for existence which has taught the  ant the lesson of selfsacrifice to the community is  also able to teach that higher devotion of mother to  child and friend to friend which ends in a tender  love for every living being since it recognises that  mutual help and sympathy are among the most  powerful weapons as they are also certainly the most  noble incentives which can be employed in fighting  the battle of life
