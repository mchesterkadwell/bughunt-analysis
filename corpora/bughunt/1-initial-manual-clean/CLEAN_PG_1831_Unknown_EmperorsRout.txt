as the emperor moth sat one evening in may fanned by numberless wings in the moons silver ray  while around him the zephyrs breathed sweetest perfume  thus he spoke to his dwarf with the ragged white plume that vain butterflys ball i hear was most splendid and as the world says very fully attended though she never asked us but assigned as a cause we were all much too heavy to gallope and waltz  what impertinence this want of grace to ascribe to the lord of the whole lepidopterous tribe i tooll give a ball and such folks to chastise  ill not be at home to these pert butterflies bid the empress come hither and well talk about  what arrangements to make for a capital rout the empress obeyed her lords summons with speed  and proceeded her visiting tablets to read  that those of her subjects whose homage was booked in that coveted record might not be oerlooked then the bufftip began to write each moth a card  having one for herself just by way of reward first ask says the emperor the glory of kent  on having much beauty my mind is quite bent the belle too of brixton the marvel du jour  and the peachblossom moth youll invite i am sure the sphinx too shall come who makes riddles so well and the gipsey be ready our fortunes to tell  mother shipton shall chaprone the lovely black i and those awkward greek girls lambda gamma and chi hebrew character too who for routs has a passion  and ill ask mrs gothic though shes out of fashion  for i love my old friends and had rather that they  should partake of our feast than the idle and gay  who flutter about without object or reason  just live for an hour and last but a season  how little alas do great moths bear in mind that their tenure of life is of just the same kind  youre right said the empress and truly twere shabby  texclude from our party poor old mrs tabby  and the rustics ill ask though not one has a gown  in which to appear save of black grey or brown  and some of them go too so feathered and flounced  that the coxcomb called prominent on them pronounced  a sentence of censure quite just but so tart  that i felt when i heard it quite cut to the heart  but now to proceed sire the leopard i vote  be razed from our list with that ugly old goat  who in youth made such terrible use of his jaws  that i dread i confess een the sight of his claws  and as to his muscles tis said that when counted  to four thousand and just fortyone they amounted  of musk too im told he sheds such perfume  that wherever he goes he fills the whole room  exclude him we will with the old dromedary  the elephant cunning and fox too so wary  that though i dont know it for certain im told  they cheat at ecarté like hermes of old  the ghost and deaths head and that terrible host  would but scare all the guestshere the emperor lost  for a moment his patience and cried to his spouse  if thus you proceed maam my anger youll rouse  like th egyptians of old ill have at my feast  a figure of death or his crossbones at least  to remind all our guests of the limited span  that to moths is allotted as well as to man  and how een in the midst of enjoyments gay hour  we are still in deaths stern and inflexible power  so let them have cards and ill go and prepare  for receiving our friends the best possible fare  the monarch then went with the eyed hawk his scout  to search for a spot fit for giving his rout  a green ring he found the work of a fairy  and thinking it looked both commodious and airy  he called to him brimstone to measure the ground  for another geometra could not be found  of this workman he knew the correctness full well  what he wrought was as nice as if done by a spell  the spot was judged proper and erected in haste  were some well fashioned rooms which displayed his good taste  carpet moths were appointed to stencil the floor  the clothes moths with gossamer covered the door  mahogany and wainscot were neither deficient  in offering their aid which proved most efficient  while veneers both rosy and yellow were able  timprove by their help the decayed supper table  for the crockery china mark promised to strive  and galleria offered to steal from a hive  profusion of honey pinguinalis brought butter  and with wax cereana came all in a flutter  these presents the emperor gladly accepted  save gallerias theft which with scorn was rejected  so little do moths of great minds patronise  the base who by fraud or extortion would rise  in the mean time the empress her swifts had sent out  to deliver the cards for this elegant rout  puss sent an excuse with the kitten engaged  and the eggar poor lady was highly enraged  that her numerous offspring requiring her care  prevented her joining a party so rare  the burnets brown pinioned the dingy brocades  the black raven feather and sweet angle shades  had promised that day with the tussock to dine  a lady of fashion whose hour was nine  but when they received their dread sovereigns command  they yielded to customs imperious demand  for moths with us mortals in this do agree  that all parties must bow to a monarchs decree  lady lappet being ill the poplar lutestring  the two misses nonpareil promised to bring  and the spectacle moth too near sighted to go  sent his ward the bright eye with the flame furbelow  whose young lover the beautiful brave unicorn  had been shot in a duel with the red striped hawthorn  not quite fit to appear the gallant swallow tail  at the doctors with anger continued to rail  he having been lamed by the awkward bulrush  to the serious alarm of the fair maidens blush  the day now arrived and at nine of the night  the glowworm being hired the highways to light  the guests gan to assemble and each was announced  by the herald who loudly their names all pronounced  the erminea lady of noble degree  introduced a long train of her large family  some in muslin some satin were chastely arrayed  while the emeraldthe pearl and the mocha  displayed  their jewels so costly that poor burnished brass  unnoticed was suffered the evening to pass  from the banks of the niger the blackamoor brought  a fat moorwho presented a tyger just caught  an old gentlewomanhad promised to bring  a musical miss who divinely could sing  but whose fair head no larger than that of a dot  was filled with the thought of a true lovers knot  so she hemd and she had then unblushingly told  how she caught as she came a most violent cold  and felt such oppression and pain in her throat  that she scarcely dared venture to utter a note  and thus with most misses of human creation  how often their colds are but mere affectation  the dancing began and soft music was heard  provided twas said by the sweet humming bird  old colonel gold spangle his dancing days past  volunteered with good humour the dances to cast  to the forward miss portland captain christian he brought  who aided by mars the young lady had caught  for moths like their betters as i have been told  are mightily taken with scarlet and gold  the foresters danced arrayed all in green  with the clear wingswhose beauty gave life to the scene  the mouse quite enamoured entreated in vain  the hand of the lovely pease blossom to gain  and the satellite though he till now had sat still  made up to the seraph to dance a quadrille  the quakers who neer had been seen at a ball  with the coronets galloped around the great hall  and the sad mourning widow her weeds put away  to waltz with the lustrous japan now quite gay  while the magpie obtained universal applause  by fluttering a hornpipe upon his hind claws  the vapourer came not but he was no loss  for wherever he went he was stupid and cross  and his wife an old dowdy bereft of all wings  was unfit to appear as th associate of kings  the daggercame armed and looked all around  but his charmer miss snout was no where to be found  for she had not been asked and the figure of eight  with his cousin the sprawler joined the party so late  that morn was forth peeping and the dancing had done  when spring usher announced the young beautiful nun  the gnomana now indexed the hour of four  the guests were assembled around the great door  which the lacqueys threw open and each in his rank  found a seat for himself and they all ate and drank  with a relish that would not disgrace the guildhall  to compare for a moment such great things with small  where londons lord mayor and his aldermen deign  to feast upon turtle and tipple champagne  old drinker the butler of wine served the best  and a footman was placed at the chair of each guest  in orange in yellow or black coats dressed out  for their liveries twas said were all made for the rout  the emperor began mirth and glee to inspire  when a loud cry was heard of the chimneys on fire  all started in fear from the table to learn  if the house was in flames or likely to burn  each snatched up a candle so left the room dark  and the moment was seized by the chamomile shark  to plunder the table the yorkshire magpie  strove also with his share of booty to fly  but was stopped by the lacqueys who then in a trice  demolished themselves every thing that was nice midst this glorious confusion a mischievous pug  contrived of the claret to empty each jug  but not unperceived by young miss exclamation  who by her loud cries caused immense consternation  meanwhile came the sweep with the chimney sweeps boy  and two other assistants who ran to employ  every means they could think of to put out the flame  in which they succeeded and found that the blame

empress my dear let us never more try  with the butterflies party so vainly to vie  for what with the heat the fatigue and the fright  i never before passed so trying a night  i would
 not again undergo the vexation  of such a soirée for the wealth of a nation  with you i agree the sage emperor replied  who deemed it a lesson to cure them of pride  and i trust that the thread of our lives will spin out  ere we ever again attempt such a rout alas we must own we were never designed  to flit in the sunshine or soar on the wind  natures changeless decree has allotted its share  to each beast of the field to each bird of the air to each reptile that creeps to each insect that flies and who dares to rebel against nature but dies
