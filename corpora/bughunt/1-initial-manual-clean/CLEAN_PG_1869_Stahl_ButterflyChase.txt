yes little minnie and her cousin bertie have quite made up their minds to have a splendid collection of butterflies they have been reading all about it in a book which their uncle who is a professor at the museum has sent them in this beautiful book they have learnt all about ithow to chase the butterflies and how to catch them and how to arrange them in glass cases when they are caught everything they want is ready for them their uncle has sent with the book two butterflynets a pretty case filled with crooked scissors tweezers pincers and all sorts of sharp steel instruments a pretty box at the bottom of which are little round pieces of cork glued in rows with long largeheaded pins to run through the butterflies and another little box with a lot of small squares of glass which are to be put over their wings to keep them open and prevent them from fluttering and beating about in the beautiful book there are pretty coloured pictures of the fine butterflies that they may meet with in their chases with the names of each kind printed underneath so that they will know them all when they catch them how very interesting butterflies are minnies mamma who is almost like a mamma to bertie too though she is only his aunt would be very glad to see her little ones fond of natural history but still she does not seem quite pleased with their uncles idea in sending them not only the pretty book but the nets and the sharp dreadfullooking steel things which they are to use in making their collection she shook her head rather sadly when she saw the pretty nets which were to stop the butterflies from flying about so happily and the pins and tweezers which were to turn them into lifeless specimens in a glass box but she did not wish to vex their kind uncle who was a very learned man and was always thinking of collections and museums and science and experiments and she did not like to tell him that she would rather her little ones should learn about butterflies from the book with its beautiful pictures and from watching them flying about and settling on the flowers in the fields and that she did not think it could be a nice play for children to catch and kill the pretty harmless creatures it is a beautiful day minnie and bertie are all ready to start with their light gauze nets in their hands berties is green and minnies is blue bertie has slung the butterflybox with the corks and great pins over his shoulder he looks quite like a sportsman they are going to the daisy field for their first chase it is a beautiful meadow full of flowers which the butterflies are very fond of they say goodbye to mamma she goes with them to the bottom of the steps the daisy field is not far off from the drawingroom window dear mamma will be able to see the chase they have promised not to make themselves too hot now they are off armed with their nets they are sure to have a splendid chase bertie intends to catch a dozen peacock butterflies and minnie a dozen emperors that will make twentyfour butterflies peacocks and emperors are the finest of allthe only butterflies they mean to catch as soon as they reach the field the two hunters hold a consultation and arrange the plan of proceeding bertie will take the right side of the field and minnie the left they must not come in each others way only if one should want help then the other is to fly to the rescue they walk gently along each on the proper side just as they agreed for in the first place the grass is very high and that makes it difficult to run fast and then of course they must not frighten the butterflies they must go very cautiously so as to take them by surprise there is a donkey in the field he looks very much astonished at something i think he is asking himself if the butterflyhunters are not come to hunt him what an absurd donkey to think of any one hunting donkeys with a butterflynet everything is blooming in the meadow the air is full of soft murmurs and the insects make a musical hum at the hunters approach the grasshoppers hop the bees fly off and thousands of paleblue or white butterflies seem to come out of the flowers but they are too small and there are so many of them that they do not know which to catch peacocks are what they want or emperors minnie finds that there are holes in the ground hidden under the grass which make her trip and there are disagreeable plants growing among the daisies which sting her legs and even some that tear little slits in her frockbut when one goes ahunting one must not be particular another time she will ask for a pair of gaiters like berties and a very thick frock mr donkey is very inquisitive hushbertie stops all on a sudden and makes signs to minnie not to stir he must have spied a peacock how cleverly and quietly he steals upnearer nearer without the slightest noise he scarcely seems to breathe minnie would like to run across to see the beautiful peacock bertie holds up his net all ready to catch the butterfly the wind puffs the green gauze a little and minnies heart beats with impatience the donkey cannot conceive what the children are doing they seem to pay no attention to him all on a sudden bertie brings down the net and then throws himself on his hands and knees to make sure of his success he must have caught the butterfly no there is no butterflynothing at all in the net but a bit of clover bertie seems rather unhappy about it but i know who is happy enoughthe beautiful butterfly that has had such a fortunate escape how he soars away however bertie calls out to his cousin that it was not a real peacock after all which is some comfort the donkey seeing bertie on allfours wonders whether he is mocking him and making fun of him butterflies are very silly i think the peacock cannot have noticed minnie for he flies very imprudently close to her minnie will manage much better than bertie yes indeed she is not going to let such a beautiful butterfly get away for he is very beautiful though he may not be a peacock pat she has got him and very tight too so that he cannot possibly get away under the rim have you got him cries bertie yes yes answers minnie oh come quick bertie runs up but oh dear the illnatured butterfly has made his escape through a hole in the net which had been torn by a hedge he laughs at miss minnie the goodfornothing butterfly he flies up so high so high that the little hunters gazing up at him almost tumble over on their backs but the donkey is not going to waste his time in staring up into the sky and very wisely goes back to his browsing let us lie down on the grass says bertie and be on the watch to take the peacock by surprise when he cannot see any more of us he will come down butterflies are too greedy to stay up in the air very long they want to come down to suck the honey out of the flowers the two hunters hide themselves carefully and wait for their revenge with their nets all ready in their hands it is a long time to wait but if one goes ahunting one must have patience the donkey is out of all patience and says to himself what are they going to do really he is a most inquisitive donkey he wants to know everything the butterfly seeing nothing more of them comes down by degrees first he flies to the right then he flies to the left then he flies round and round he cant make up his mind about anything says bertie and he doesnt know a bit where he is going says minnie he looks every minute as if he were going to stop he seems as if he wanted a daisy and then he goes right off to another flower oh this is cool the impudent butterfly has popped right down on minnies nose at first bertie could scarcely believe his eyes bertie never laughed so much in his life minnie who certainly was not expecting anything of the kind is so taken by surprise that she jumps up on her feet and the butterfly quite as much astonished at what he has done flies off again as quickly as before minnie cannot leave off rubbing her nose the butterflys little feet did tickle her so he is a very rude butterfly said minnie oh he must have mistaken your little nose for a flower said bertie he did not mean to offend you he meant to be very polite but there is no time for laughing the butterfly has settled on a great tuft of meadowsweet all in flower the two hunters seeing this forget all their plans and run both together after him with all their might but the butterfly is not so silly as to wait for them every time he sees his two enemies come near off he starts again a dozen times minnie thought she had him and a dozen times bertie said he had got him but a dozen times he got away what troublesome things to catch butterflies are said the two hunters what is to be done we have tried every possible way minnie has been running so much that she is quite out of breath and her hair has fallen all over her shoulders bertie too is in a most uncomfortable state and as red as a turkeycock oh how hot it is but they cannot lose their time in standing still they just stop for a few seconds to take breath and then set off again but the butterfly has got a good start and is a long way off already all this time the donkey is lying quite coolly on the grass but he just takes a look now and then at the hunters the donkey seeing them come quite close to him is taken by surprise he is quite sure now that they are running after him he must be a most conceited ass to suppose that two such hunters as minnie and bertie have nothing better to do than to hunt donkeys he thinks so much of himself this donkey that he is perfectly silly so bertie thinks as for minnie she does not trouble herself about him at all she can think of nothing but her butterfly heighho what has happened bertie and minnie who seemed only just now to be flying over the ground have disappeared as if by magic this is how it was bertie and minnie rushing along so eagerly did not notice that they had got to the bottom of the field and at the bottom of the field was a ditch and into the ditch they went head over heels rolling one over the other and at the bottom of the ditch there was some water left by the rainnasty yellow water poor minnie is quite frightened bertie has tumbled right upon her and bertie is so heavy besides she has got very wet and her pretty white frock is all dirtied with the mud it is not nice at all bertie helps her up but she is half inclined to cry oh says bertie when we go ahunting we must not mind such little things we shall be sure to have plenty more of the same sort minnie begins to think she has had enough already what has become of the butterfly all this time cries bertie who would have thought it he is quietly settled not two yards from the spot where his enemies fell so quiet that one would have thought him asleep or dreaming on the tuft of beautiful bluebells where bertie has just found him he turns his back scornfully on the hunters just as if he had seen or heard nothing and as if all that has happened did not concern him in the least bertie hopes to have his revenge now he pops his net down so neatly on the careless butterfly that this time mr peacock is safely caught for there are no holes in berties net how he beats about says bertie oh he will spoil all his wings says minnie minnie however remembering the directions in her uncles book has opened the box while bertie holds his net tightly down on the ground the butterfly cannot escape minnie has given her cousin a great long pin with a sharp point the donkey who had run off to some distance comes back when he sees the hunters stop he says to himself that something extraordinary must have happened and he is not wrong this time bertie holds the big pin close to the quivering body of the poor butterfly he must find the exact spot in the middle of his back so that the operation may not fail he has told minnie to put her hands flat down on the net one on each side of the poor prisoner the butterfly thus pressed can scarcely stir a few convulsive struggles are the only signs of his agony and his helplessness his head with its large eyes can still move a little how dreadful his eyes look they are full of terror bertie was so proud of his victory why does he hesitate now why because just when he was going to put his poor prisoner to death the childs heart and hand trembledbecause he looked at his cousin and saw her turn palebecause minnie turned away her head that she might not see her cousin do this cruel deed she felt that death was dreadful whether it were a mans death or a butterflys this pin was just the same to the poor insect as a sword would be to a man oh bertie bertie she cried bursting into tears no no dont let us kill him only think bertie it said in uncles book that butterflies live for several days with pins run through them oh how dreadful it must be i could not bear to see it and you could not bertie it is not nice play to kill things i dont like chasing butterflies bertie has lifted up his net oh the happy beautiful butterfly he thought himself just dead and he has come back to life one moment to shake his wings and away he soars again in his joyous flight towards the blue sky minnie throws her arms round berties neck and says oh thank you bertie they are very happy too good little bertie and dear little minnie they know they have done right they will never go chasing butterflies again never never but from the balcony where she was sitting minnies mamma had seen them fall into the ditch and was hastening to them the little hunters were so absorbed that they did not see her coming but dear mamma understands it all and she is very much pleased with her little children when they are older she will explain to them that though it is not wrong for learned men to make painful experiments in order to gain useful knowledge no one else should wantonly destroy even the least of gods creatures as for the donkey i dont know what has become of him i think he has given up trying to understand anything about the matter and gone home to his stable
