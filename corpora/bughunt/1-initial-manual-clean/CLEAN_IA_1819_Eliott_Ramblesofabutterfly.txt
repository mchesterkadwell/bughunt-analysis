CHAP I I CANNOT doubt but that all my youthful friends are well acquainted with the beautiful insect called a Butterfly yet it is not improbable that some are ignorant of the different states of its existence they have viewed its rich tints with admiration chased it for such beauty but never imagined that the object of their pursuit was once an insignificant worm from which they would have turned in disgust Such however is the nor let us pass over the useful lesson it conveys Supposing our form to be as unseemly as the butterflys in its early state we have it in our power to cultivate and adorn the mind vnth beauties far superior to the gaudy insects because lasting their charms are perishable and fade with the passing hour the charms of intellectual improvement bloom through life a constant source of gratification to ourselves and a certain passport to the esteem of the wise and good How much more valuable this kind of Approbation than the everyday praises bestowed on a pretty face tho would not prefer being a rational and amiable little boy or girl though plain in features to the gayest attired butterfly that ever sported among the fairest flowers The e2s from which these insects proceed are hatched by the sun a whose powerful rays bursting their prison walls set at liberty the grovel ing and helpless worm In this state it exhibits none of that activity so evident in the butterfly its motion is a slothful creeping pace in food green leaves This change is succeeded by one still more inactive they fold themselves as it were into a kind of case or covering and remahi a certain time in a complete state of torpidity From this second confinement they emerge in all their beauty no longer the sluggish pedestrian of the earth but the gay and airy traveller of the atmosphere There are day and night butterflies we distinguish the first by the slight texture of its wings which resemble a thin silk or gauze well adapted to fly during the heat of day The night traveller is more substantially clothed Nature has given it wings resembling velvet its little members are enveloped in a kind of fur It was on a sultry morning in July soon after sunrise that one of this gay tribe quitted the friendly shade of a laurel to sip the sweets of early dawn His fickle nature led him from flower to flower scarce had he tasted the dew of one when his roving eye caught the full drop pending from another and away he flew to enjoy it The garden however was not re markable for the variety of its productions it was a small piece of ground attached to a neat white cottage whose owners were too poor to possess a larger one and too industrious to spare much time in the cultivation of what they had To the subject of our history it was every thing he had seen no bet tor here he was born and here he expected to die tis true he felt the sameness of the scene but unconscious of the nature of his feelings he sought not to remedy the evil endeavouring to make the most of his situation nor leaving a flower wild or otherwise uritasted Tired at length of his own inconstancy he fixed upon a fragrant jasmine that crept over the front of the dwelling in wild luxunance and so exquisite were its sweets that he resolved to make his breakfast of them The opening of a casement just above his head interrupted the meal but perceiving he was not noticed he continued his repast during which his curiosity was particularly attracted by the conversation of a chubby boy and girl who standing at the open window were learning their lesson from the same book Though useless himself he could not forbear admiring the attention they bestowed on the allotted task questioning each other with the greatest exactness scarcely allowing a minute for breakfast which they took as they stood it consisted of a small basin of milk and some coarse brown bread Homely as such fare would appear to many young folks with whom I am acquainted these children unaccustomed to luxuries ate and drank with the keenest appetite nor seemed to covet better A female voice called them just as they had finished and our butterfly having nothing farther to divert him crept under a cluster of jasmine and sunk into a gentle slumber How loni he continued thus is uncertain He was aroused suddenly by a rude shock that nearly threw 7 him from his fragrant bed Agitated and confused he flew to the opposite side of the gar den and resting upon the broken pales surveyed with fearful eyes the spot he had just quitted to dis cover the cause of his alarm It was in fact no other than the hand of the little girl who according to her usual custom had plucked a sprig off the tree to adorn her bosom previous to her going to school Shortly after she came out of the cottage accompanied by her brother he carrying his book she her knitting and open ing the gate they proceeded up the green lane in which the house stood Their winged admirer looked after them with regret he had formed a most favourable opinion of them and wished to be better acquainted with them and to see where they were then iioing his wings expanded with his wishes he flew after them The girl stopped to add a hedge flower to her nosegay he failed not to follow her example he stopped too the flow ers were wild but sweet and being a novelty highly gratified his epicurism Keeping at a certain distance he followed the cheerful pair until they reached a very small hut much infe rior to their own the door was open and disclosed to our astonished traveller from fifteen to twenty children of both sexes seated in exact order upon low wooden benches Near the only window in the apartment sat the dame or humble mistress of the seminary her shrill voice and the buzz of her scholars somewhat intimidated and checked him He looked round for a shelter but no dainty blossom met his eye a few bushes covered with dust were alone in view Thus circumstanced he gladly availed him self of a pot of stonecrop which stood on the broad window frame here there was no temptation for the appetite but the scene within attract ed his notice sufficiently to banish self for a time The variety of countenances the studious attention of some the indolent attitudes of others and above all the proper conduct of his two little friends amused and excited the liveliest pleasure in the new visi tor Nor did the dame escape his observation her well mended gown of divers colours clean check apron and lilywhite cap gave him a strong idea of her cleanliness but there was a certain severity in her features heightened perhaps by her uncouth spectacles that made him keep aloof from her side of the window his preju dice however was greatly lessened when he heard her bestow unlimited praises on his favorite Phebe and her brother nay he ventured to rest a minute on the back of her chair while in this station he discovered a large beau pot of fresh flowers placed in a broken red teapot by way of ornament to the smoke coloured cbini tfey shelf A butterfly of the ton would have shuddered at the idea of sipping the sweets of the loveliest flowers if not elegantly arranged in a china vase but our novice was totally ignorant of fashionable life the dames teapot disgusted not his deli cate feelings he flew immediately to the luring spot and skipped from bud to flower with all the agility of nature His sportive movements at length caught the eve of an idler who directly communicated the intelligence to another dunce IC See what a beautiful butterfly cried the latter to a third and the news spread like wild fire Now of all the dames senses that of hearing was undoubtedly the keenest the general murmur did not escape her notice without raiding her head she lookeJ over her huge spectacles with an expression peculiar to herself and those who observed her were instantly mute and as quiet as mice Unluckily all did not profit by the warning a bold adventurer darted forward and threw his Primer at the unconscious in sect alas with aim too sure the stun ned victim fell senseless on the hearth This cruelty was beheld with just indignation by the watchful preceptress who immediately summoned the offen der to come forth in a tone of voice never disobeyed Cowardice and cruelty usually go together thus he who for sport had endeavoured to kill a harmless butterfly now shrank from the just reproof of his mistress After chiding him for his inhumanity and inflicting some smart strokes of a small switch upon his right hand that committed the deed he was placed in the middle of the room as an object of disgrace with both hands tied he hind his back to prevent his using them improperly again the good lady further observed that idle people were always doing mischief for want of better employment while the diligent seldom did wrong because never at a loss for something useful to fill up time without hurting themselves or others as an instance of the last she named Phebe and her brother Ned whose behaviour was not only a credit to her school but a pattern for every child present The objects of her praise blushed with genuine modesty others with shame yet all appeared to feel the justness of her commendation She then bade Ned take the butterfly gently by the wing and place it out side of the window to try if the fresh air might not revive suspended anima tion Ned did so and in a few minutes the ciame5 humane intc trerc rewarded by seeing the euted insect move and shake its wings though feebly A quarter of an hour had nearly elapsed before its strengtn permitted flight and then whither was he to go his recollection of the mornings route was too faint to venture on retracing it should he seek a new road what evils might he not encounter how many enemies all children were not Neds and Phebes his late narrow escape had proved this truth and the idea of the past made him shudder at the thought of remain ing where he was At this critical moment two of his species flew briskly across the road his spirits revived instantly in these thought he I shall surely find friends and stretching his feeble wings followed their course He was however ill calculated for ihe pursuit in a short time they were completely out of sight leaving him on a bind where he was compelled to rest Fatigue and anxiety produced a drowsiness and creeping into the heart of the flower he com posed himself to slumber and never had he required it so much From this repose he awoke much refreshed leaving his couch he alighted on the grass to enjoy the cheering beams of the sun now shin ing in his meridian glory The bloom ing clover which here and there had escaped the mowers scythe afforded him a rich repast nay he fancied it equal to his favorite jasmine and vas about making a vow never more to seek food from a higher source when a rude clamour struck his ear a swarm of urchins leaped a stile into the meadows among whom he was at no loss to discover his late enemy A bind is the wild Convolvolus His relish for clover induced not a moments stay his flight was immediate and so eager was he to escape that regardless of distance he con tinued his route for many minutes without stopping but at length tempted by the grateful odour of a honeysuckle whose fragrant flowers hung negligently over a long wall he descended on the inner side Attached as he certainly was to the sweets of life the anticipated enjoyment of this feast was quickly forgotten from the beauty of the scenery presented to his view He looked from one charming object to another only to increase his admiration At the extremity of an extensive and tastefully arranged garden stood a dwelling nowadays styled a cottage but how unlike the simple one of his morning friends or the crazy hut of the schoolmistress The shining white of its stone dashed wall was agreeably relieved by the shade of several stately elms labernums blend ing their drooping branches formed an arched entrance to the house which was still farther sheltered by a green viranda that extended from one extremity to the other a verdant lawn descended with a gentle slope to the garden this last was adorned with all that elegance could suggest or wealth procure Our amazed traveller knew not how to decide how to choose where every thing seemed perfect his eye wandered over the luxuriant scene without the power of fixing till perceiving several of his kind basking in the broad bosom of the sunflower he joined the party desirous of forming an acquaintance and also of profiting ii i iy their superior judgment He felt some degree of embarrassment listening to the conversation of these gay flutterers who were natives of the delicious spot and consequently well acquainted with all its productions His confusion was quickly discerned and perhaps might have exposed him to ridicule had not the beauty of his form and the glowing tints of his spotted wings announced his descent that he was of the peacocks eye species could not be denied however rustic his manners nor could some of the group forbear shewing certain traits of envy highly gratifying to his vanity and renovating to hs drooping courage The instruction he had meant to seek now appeared derogatory he determined to conceal his ignorance as much as possible and by follow ing the example of others to acquire fashionable if not useful knowledge It was now for the first time he heard condemned as vulgar those flowers on which it had heen his ut most wishes lo feed the bare mention of clover excited disgust in more than one while a slight commendation bestowed on the simple violet by an old butterfly of the skull tribe caused a general laugh at the speakers expence Truth obliges us to confess that such sentiments were perfectly in unison with his own but the fear of ridicule checked his avowing as much and he readily entered into the false opinion of his companions thus even an insect shrank from sincerity because he preferred the approbation of the weak and vain In the course of a few minutes he became tolerably sociable with two or three in whose company he per formed a tour nearly round the gar den never failing to extol those sweeis lio found were considered as liixuik vet secretly preferring the cottage was mine to many of them At sight of a delicate female the whole party were in motion nor was our beau backward in the pursuit Never had he beheld so much loveliness her spotless and transparent wings rivalled the snow in whiteness the easy graceful ness of her flight added to her beauty Our novice was quickly enamoured Her modesty teemed unconscious of the power of her charms and while she flew from flower to flower he imagined it was to avoid her followers in this how ever he was deceived these frequent rests were made but to lead them on nor did she fix till assured they were rear enough to discern the action A moss rose tree was her choice the colour of which contrasted with her oun exquisite white dazzled the be holders At length he descended but ventured not to approach the fair nearer than three branches distance His temerity was not checked though he had soon the satisfaction of seeing his companions dismissed with disdain Upon this he advanced and was received with complacency and invited to the same flower on vhich she sported Thus honoured thus distinguished he forgot all past perils nay he looked forward with a feeling of certainty to spending his life with the gentle partner of his love the rose tree their home But alas his vanity exceeded his know ledge of the world At the very moment when his glowing imagination was picturing such scenes of bliss a gaudy rival approached whose large and glaring yellow wings caught the keen eye of her ladyship A lew circuits round the bush completed the conquest his boidnc a increased and he alighted upon the very same stem to the great indig nation of our enraged hero who was preparing to repulse the intrusion when in the twinkling of an eye the fop and fair coquette took wing and fled together Surprise and mortifi cation prevented a pursuit on his part while he secretly avowed never more to attach himself to the white winged species Shame forbade his returning to the sunflower haunt where he naturally expected to encounter the banter of his late associates On quitting the scene of degradation he found him self directly opposite the house he had admired at a distance one of the rooms opened with glass doors on the lawn curiosity induced him to enter and well was he repaid for his trouble the highly finished furnitare large mirrors stands of flowers globes with gold fish c over whelmed him with their splendour nor was this all from the frame of a superb chimney glass he first be held his own personal charms and if before he possessed the vanity ascribed to his species trebly was it increased by the unexpected disco very again and again he expanded bis exquisite wings and flying from one end of the mirror to the other ceased not to admire the superior beauty with which Nature had distinguished him from the vulgar of his kind This frivolous employment was interrupted by the entrance of two boys and a girl who rushing suddenly Into the room seated themselves at a table over which was dispersed books maps and other symbols of instruction The dress and appearance of these children so different from those he had ever seen bespoke them of a higher rank in life and as external show was just then high in his estimation he could apprehend no danger from such pretty and well dressed individuals nor deemed it necessary to change his situation farther than by retiring to a basket of miniionctte that with other flowers decorated a green stand before the fireplace In a short time the youngest of the boys apparently six years of age crept softly from his seat and advancing towards the window closed it in a moment then clapping his hands in triumph exclaimed so so I have you at last Mr Butterfly 1 and with one sweep of his hand he secured the unsuspecting flutterer See Mary said he this is the very butterfly that gave us such a chase this morning No it is not j he continued opening his hand and viewing the nearly senseless insect extended in the palm of it no it is one a thousand times prettier look Arthur did you ever see any thing so beautiful Beautiful indeed replied Arthur but your rough usage has nearly stifled the poor Stifled returned he why you dont mean to say that a butterfly can feel pain like us I certainly do mean to say so Bob and I am not a little surprised to hear you make so foolish a remark Cruel as well as foolish I think observed their sister I know I should be very sorry to squeeze an harmless insect in that way for one must be silly indeed not to know that a little worm can feel pain as well as men and women Well then I did not know it said Robert so there is some excuse for my fault but pray Miss Wiseacre if you were so clever why did you join me today when I was trying to catch one Because sir I wished to give it my uncle Harvey to put in his pretty glass case not to hurt it I assure you sir Yet Mary interrupted Arthur the butterfly would have fared worse with you than with Bob for when my uncle had received it he would have killed it immediately Did you not observe when shewing us his collection the insects were all dead Yes certainly I did brother but then I thought he kept them all carefully and led them until they yew old and died After that you know there could be no cruelty in shutting them up in a box Feed them till they die repeated Arthur no no child that would never suit his purpose he kills them while their beauty is in its prime and before age or accident should lessen it How very very cruel returned Mary shuddering u I think I shall never again look at his glass case with pleasure During this conversation the nearly exhausted insect lay panting upon the table where Robert had dropped it when censured by his sister He evidently desired to retain it but Arthur combated his inclination and at length gently raising it by the wing carried it to the window and placed it on the frame near the ground The sun and air quickly restored animation and while the young scholars pursued their studies it once more took wing Flying leisurely down the slope its tickle nature was attracted by the scent and glowing tints of a rose whose spreading bush skirted the lawn Scarcely was the discovery made ere a gentleman approached arid taking a penknife from his pocket separated the identical flower from the parent stem Many roses yet adorned the bush but our epicure butterfly coveted that one Casting a longing eve towards the stolen treasure he suddenly deter mined to pursue the owner in the hope of snatching a taste of its sweets His ardour was a little checked on finding the gentleman enter the room he had just quitted and he hovered a few minutes near the window But his fears entirely vanished when perceiving the blushing flower deposited in a china jar with a variety of others equally beautiful Again he ventured into the apartments and flew boldly to the tempting spot He accomplished his wish in safety for the children were too busily occupied with their lessons to spare him a portion of their notice Had our butterfly possessed much intellect he had now ample opportunity for improvement Mary and her brothers were clever children and by perseverance and attention well repaid their father for his kindness in instructing them But idleness in butterflies is excusable and cannot injure the human species On the contrary in children it is a fault of the greatest magnitude leading to the most distressing consequences and a constant source of anxiety to those who have the misfortune to be connected with them Our rover though he did justice to the good conduct of the interesting trio felt no inclination to profit by their example and continued feasting until the children concluded their morning studies He heard the father praise their diligence and witnessed the blush of pleasure such praise created Pray papa asked Robert can you tell me why Charles Maynard who is not as old as my brother should know every thing as well as his master I did not understand he was so very clever returned the gentleman smiling k Clever papa why he gets through a dozen lessons in half an hour he has such a way of going from one thing to another without trouble and reads writes draws maps and translates French fables 3 whilst we should be studying our geography only That is doing a great deal Robert but learning little if he thus hurry over all he cannot pay proper attention to any and of course is little the wiser for being taught His studies are like the pursuits of a butterfly sipping at every flower with out deriving real benefit from one You speak lightly of butterflies papa yet bees do the very same and I have heard you praise their industry And deservedly so my dear the bee sips not from a love of change only nor does she cull the sweets for herself alone her employment is the source of advantage to others Arthur has lately been reading an interesting account of this industrious insect and can give you some useful information on the subject Yes do dear Arthur added Mary for I think their history quite a curiosity 5 Arthur readily assented and gave the following account of them It is generally understood that bees are subject to laws and government There is in every hive a certain bee of larger growth than the rest who is evidently considered the superior by the community Naturalists are of opinion hat this head or monarch is a female and mother of all the hive Those we call drones which are larger and of a darker colour than the common bee are males they number from four to five hundred in a hive It is said the queen has her apartment in the upper part of the hive She seldom appears in public but when been is attended by several large bees probably the drones who follow her with respect or form a circle round her fluttering their wings as if rejoiced by her presence She is their chief concern in cases of danger and if deprived of her by any mis fortune they neglect all business and either fly away at random or languish and die The hive is a busy and curious scene business is carried on with the greatest diligence and complete unanimity prevails throughout the whole community they sympathize when in danger and fight for each other with the utmost courage and resolution The interest of the one is that of the whole their store the produce of the industrious is alike shared by all When alone and distant from their companions they are patient of affront but when within reach of assistance will not be disturbed in their labours without resenting the insult Amfcl plenty they are frugal and abstemious anioni themselves strictly honest but apt to plunder their neighbours when opportunity offers This often produces wars and tumults betwixt one hive and another They never suffer any thing offensive to remain in the hive uniting all their strength to remove the disagreeable object With a prudence not inferior t3 human foresight they provide in sum mer for the necessities of winter They give no encouragement to idle ness but as Spring advances and the young bees are able to provide for themselves the old ones send out a colony or swarm of them to shift for themselves and find another habitation In building their combs they separate into four bands the first of which traverse the fields to collect materials for the structure which chiefly consists of the tine dust they gather from flowers and which mixed with a certain gluey substance is made into wax The second divi sion work upon these materials and form them into a rough sketch of the size and partitions of the cells which are built hexagonal with the nicest mathematical exactness I suppose observed Mary to her little brother you know that hexagonal signifies six sides Arthur continued The third band examine and adjust the angles remove the superfluous wax and in short complete the work The fourth class attend as labourers during the whole process and such is their diligence that the hive is fitted with combs in a fortnight Thus you see Robert bees are far more valuable than butterflies and well deserve praises their industry so generally creates I will take you some morn ing to see a glass hive which 1 am assured would much entertain you When Arthur had finished his little history of this industrious insect his brother returned him thanks observing he should never like butterflies so well as bees although they looked so much handsomer j u You are right my dear returned his father for there is no comparison in the worth of the two I trust also that you will imitate your new favorite in your endeavours to be useful and pursue your duties with the same activity At this moment Marys eye fixed on our now humble butterfly who in sensibly led to listen to the foregoing conversation felt truly abashed in learning the general opinion of his inutility and the superior qualities attached to the bee an insect he had ever held in contempt See papa said Mary there is one of the idlers you mention Yes Mary and a very handsome one of its kind but as he can only please the eye and we are not cruel enough to seek his life for the gratifi cation of looking at his fine colours sre care not how soon he goes he is welcome to our flowers but not our attention 1 Our hero certainly experienced no desire to remain where he was so lit tle valued he instantly spread his wings and again explored the garden Here every thing offered pleasure Lut offended by his late reception he deigned not to continue near his tra ducers but passing over the vall opposite to where he first entered found himself on the high road Vilri flowers alone presented themselves to his view but these were sufficient lie was not very hungry and his last excursion had lessened his love of variety he began to wish himself in the garden where he first drew breath and had he known the way would assuredly have sought his native jes samine Several children passed him on the road but no Phebe or Ned were of the number and he was now sufficiently acquainted with the dispositions of children not to feel tenacious of trusting himself within their reach If they cannot make any good use of me thought he I will not become the sport of their cruelty my vanity shall not mislead me this time This idea had scarcely subsided when as he was resting on the blossom of a hedge convolvulus he was suddenly seized by the rough lare hand of a countryman who had been for some time watching his serial move ments and exclaimed on catching his prize So so I have you at last mister fine wings my little ones will thank me for this I know The trembling prisoner heard him in dis may for he naturally guessed the parent who could take such a present to his child would think little of the manner in which it was treated Un pleasant was his situation but still more so the anticipation of future half stifled in the closed hand of the unfeeling ploughman he struggled in vain to get free every attempt but added to the rigour of his confinement until at length death in any other shape seemed preferable The loud buz of children announced their journeys end two girls and a boy ran to meet their father enquiring what he held so carefully concealed from them They were bid to guess and did so many times unsuccess fully The eldest girl however catch ing a glance of its wings vociferated the truth and received the trembling victim as a reward for her ingenuity Followed by the other two she return ed to the house and began rudely to examine its various beauties she was a selfish child and in her endeavours to keep all the sight to herself narrowly preserved its life as her impatient brother ran from side to side now and then snatching at the poor flutterer while Nelly as eagerly drew her hand away to prevent his seeing it The youngest child now craved her right to see the beautiful butterfly daddy brought home and oi being refused set up a violent scream which soon drew the attention of her mother whose pet she was and miss Nelly was obliged to display her pme to please the baby who not content with viewing would touch and play with it in a way so rough that more than once it was in danger of being demolished the boy took his share of tormenting and in order to teaze Nelly urged the little one to pull oft its wings This cruel deed had assuredly been performed had not the mother persuaded them it would be better to keep the pretty creature under a glass when they might look at it every da without the fear of its flying away Thii bright idea was readily embraced and the hero of our story once more escaped destruction We regret to say humanity had little share in the mothers decision her children were froward spoilt pots alive to their own gratification only and she who should have curbed their every wish of doing wrong was often obliged to submit to their sallies of passion for the sake of what she termed peace and quietness Un fortunate children thus fatally in dulged at the expense of future hap piness A broken wineglass was placed over the object of dispute who scarcely enjoyed the unexpected reprieve while the cross petulant countenances of his young persecutors assailed him in every direction as he glanced at them from his transparent prison With the power of torment ing ceased their curiosity and al though they were delighted to quarrel with one another as to the right of pulling their prisoner to pieces they cared little to look at the same thing over and over again without touch ing it At this critical juncture puss caught a mouse in the barn at news of which one and all ran to the scene of action leaving our butterfly at leisure to reflect on the horrors of his situation All past perils appeared trifling when compared to the present in the school of the good dame he had found more than one protector in the beautiful parlour at the cottage he had experienced much humanity little Roberts rough usage had not proceeded from want of feeling and severely did he censure himself for suffering disappointed vanity to lead him from safety and plenty Happily for the bee sighed he her beauty does not attract the fickle notice of child hood her sting is a sufficient punishment for the bold trespasser upon her freedom her labours are attended with liule danger and are usually crowned with success my toils are the sport of fancy and cruelty and should I escape the ever threatening evils tend to no real good in the end would I were a bee an ant or any insect worth preserving Thus meditated our hero in distress the lesson but too well applies to many of our own species who depending upon outward attraction never take into consideration the uselessness of beauty until convinced by the neglect of the wise and good that personal charms alone can never gain esteem or respect Gladly would the hum bled beauty in question have exchanged forms with the heavy droning beetle or insignificant moth for whose flimsy wings he would readily have bartered Jiis own shining spotted ones A shout from the children created new terror and quickly a huge black cat rushed into the room pursued by them all eager to possess the dead mouse he squeezed between his jars He ran from corner to corner assailed with balls sticks and whatever came in the way of his pursuers till with a sudden spring he leaped upon the table where our butterfly was placed and darting out of the window over set the wineglass and freed his companion in distress The mischief was quickly descried by Nelly who shriek ing out Oh my butterfly my butterfly mounted the table to prevent its flight but notwithstanding her activity the object of it was yet more nimble and vaulting over her out stretched hands passed the casement again to breathe the air of freedom On the thatched roof he took rest too far removed from danger to dread pursuit and listened with allowable pleasure to the bewailings of his late unfeeling mistress who traversed the garden round and round in search of her captive threatening the cat with her utmost vengeance for letting it loose Puss had fled as high as one pair of stairs into a large walnut tree regardless of Nellys commands to come down and be beaten and while she enjoyed her meal but increased the rage of the little tyrant Her brother now appeared with a hat full of stones with which he proposed pelt ing the cat until they forced her from her new abode Nelly pleased with the proposal joined in the cruel attempt but soon had reason to re pent her malice for John selecting a large flinty stone threw it with all his force it struck one of the lower branches and fell with violence on his sisters head The blow was in deed severe but the action merited the punishment and as the poor butterfly viewed her bleeding and led into the house he experienced but trifling pity for her and still less for her brother who received from his father a complete thrashing for the mischief he had caused It may be supposed the present scene possessed no attraction to induce the persecuted insect to remain in its vicinity on the contrary every object excited terror and weak as he felt after so much ill treatment he exerted himself to the utmost to fly from all he had so lately witnessed His progress was slow but every movement of his wings gave him new strength and the hateful habitation was soon out of sight After various determinations as to the road he should take he suddenly lighted on some green paling en closing a small but neatly arranged garden The appearance of the place promising but upon inspection the produce was rather useful than luxurious All was quiet however and a meal unmolested he now considered a treat a sweet pea was his choice but not his alone for at the moment he fixed on its blushing blossoms a huge bee came humming round the spot and shortly took up her quarters on the very same stem The high character he had so recently heard of her added to her formidable sting made him feel rather shy of her acquaintance and he quickly retreated to a neighbouring carnation at the same time watching the progress of the intruders pur suits A feeling strongly resembling envy pervaded his breast as he reflected on the utility of her employment and he sincerely regretted that equal power was not given to his species A cucumber glass at this moment raised his drooping pride by reflecting his handsome form but his vanity was certainly not so keen as in the morning and after a short inspection of his beauty he sought other objects A house nearly concealed by lofty trees next drew his attention and although it was far from his intention to enter the duelling of man he was led towards it by the soothing voice of childhood tones so mild that he could not believe danger existed within sound of it In a bedroom whose half closed shutters admitted a partial light he discovered the fair speaker an interesting little girl who leaning over the pillow of a sick brother endeavoured to amuse and console him her kindness seemed to rouse the young invalid who repeatedly though in a languid voice declared his Susan was the best nurse in the world I am glad you think so my dear Charles said Susan because it is my wish to please you and I well re member how good you were to me when I had the measles 5 Here Susan kissed his pale cheek and dropped the tear of recollection Charles too seemed affected and returned her caresses with equal warmth Will you read tome Susan asked he Willingly my dear brother but first let me give you the medicine Jane left in my care Charles shook his head in disapprobation and confessed he did not like taking physic Nor da I returned Susan but however disagreeable it may be I think pain is a great deal worse and when we know a little Or this bad tasting stuff will cure us it would surety be folly to sutler illness rather than take what is necessary to prevent it Charles was silent and his kind nurse arose to prepare the dreaded dose When she approached the bedside with the glass of medicine in her hand he shrank back Susan looked disappointed What shall I say to mamma when she returns she supposes I am filling her place and tending you as she would do if at home I never saw you refuse physic when she offered it and I hoped you loved me too well to do so when I became your nurse but perhaps I do not understand how to make you happy or give you what is proper as 1 flattered myself I did Tell me dear Charles what I have done that does not please you Oh you never do wrong Susan it is not with you I am displeased only as I said before I cannot bear to take physic Then you will not take it bro ther shall I do so in your stead Charles smiled Why you dont want it you are very well you know and I dare say it would do you more harm than good Perhaps so but no matter you will not get well and may wish me to be ill to keep you company No that I am sure I do not returned he I would sooner be ill a hundred times than your head should ache once so come mistress nurse bring your nasty physic and let me swallow it quietly Susan was not long in performing this part of her duty and although Charles still asserted it was very dis agreeable stuff he emptied the glass in a minute His thoughtful nurse had a lump of sugar at hand and soon made him smilingly confess the task he had performed was trifling compared to anticipation Susan now settled his pillow and smoothed the bedclothes to his satis faction and then going to a book shelf selected a volume such as she guessed would please him and seating herself by the bedside commenced the following story THE PATCHED COAT It was Sunday the bells of the village church rang their usual peal for morning Prayer Young and old heard the summons and dressed in their neatest array hastened to join in thanksgiving and supplication The appearance of the villagers was more than commonly striking for the day was Easter Sunday and the youthful inhabitants generally put on some new garb on this day The industrious parent often sacrificed self comfort to procure an article of dress for their offspring It was not a desire for finery but a proper regard to decency respect and gratitude for the blessing this day had procured One family had ever been remark able for the neatness of their clothing and until this year considered an example to the rest of the village not only in outward appearance but for general good conduct But alas adversity had changed their prospects and their dress likewise The father an industrious farmer by a series of misfortunes had been obliged to quit his farm and submit to the daily fatigues of a labourer His wife equally deserving and once the active partner of his exertions lost her life in attending two children in a dangerous fever from which they recovered though she fell a sacrifice One short year deprived him of these comforts and reduced him from comparative affluence to poverty but he was a good and religious man bore his sorrows with fortitude and en deavoured to make his children do Yhe same His greatest trouble arose from the infirmity of a little girl about eight years of are born deaf and dumb her affliction endeared her to the whole family and her gentle disposition well repaid their care but her favourite brother two years older than herself was her principal companion and helpmate Joe possessed one of the best hearts in the world his disposition was cheerful and conciliating the use of pleasure to others and never so happy as when so employed His sister Fanny was his idol he was ever inventing something to amuse her taking her pleasant walks or culling the best flowers nuts or ripest blackberries for his pet His exertions were always crowned with success for Fanny was pleased with all be did and the time he spent at school seemed the most irksome of her life while his presence instantly created the smile to delight and she Mould throw her arms round his neck and weep with joy on his return Poor Joes coat was not so lasting as his spirits and good temper his sister Martha had mended it over and over again and at length in defiance of her own wish and Joes entreaties for the contrary had been obliged to patch it with another colour I dont see people wear blue coats with brown patches said Joe examining his sisters workmanship Nor I brother but any colour is better than a hole I am sure you would not like to go in rags 1 No certainly replied he but tomorrow is Easter Sunday and every one will have a new coat while I wear an old one of different co lours True Joe but then everybody is not so poor as we in better days we did not need such contrivances when father had the power he always gave his children the best he was able to earn his misfortunes are not of his own seeking and while we see him wear an old jacket like his pre sent one I think the least we can do is to be content with our own Oh I know father cant help it said Joe and I would not say a word to vex him for twenty shillings but 1 do wish Martha that my codi had lasted whole until after tomorrow Martha smilingly added Ay and until this time next year for all our sakes Joe smiled too owned it was silly to mind a patched coat and went whistling away to pick cowslips for little Fanny I think said Joe on Easter Sun day that I will go to church by the roadway the distance is much the same Not much difference I believe answered his father but methinks boy the fields would be more pleasant and beside you would join many of your companions by going the latter way I dont much care for company today J observed Joe looking at the brown patch on his elbow Why not today my dear re turned his father noticing his sons glance I dont see why that patch should lower you in the eyes of your playfellows they all know I gave you a better when I had the power go boy go to church the old way the fields will look just as green as ever and be assured your prayers will be acceptable in an old coat as well as a new one I never knew dress make the heart better or mend the temper so the conscience be whole no matter how many holes in the garb Poor Joe felt ashamed not of his coat but of himself he tried to speak his feelings but tears prevented him kissing his father hastily he snatched up the Prayerbook ran through the garden and was over the first stile in five minutes How do you do Joe exclaimed two boys in a breath are you not going to church and this Easter Sun day Yes to be sure I am answered he a little confused His young companions exchanged looks and immediately fixed their eyes on the brown patch What do you think of my coat asked the elder one and my hat and waistcoat added the younger They are very good very pretty replied Joe Dont you wish you had such enquired the last speaker No yes answered he be cause then father would be better in the world than he is now otherwise I dont care much for new coats Then you are not ashamed of that patch on your elbow Ashamed why should I be ashamed It is no crime to wear an old coat as father says new clothes neither make us better nor wiser 1 But you look so shabby Joe I am sure I should blush to go to church in such a coat as that I dare say every one will stare at you you will be the only boy who has not new clothes I cannot help that replied Joe 1 hope I shall not be the greatest dunce or the worst tempered 7 No fear of that cried a good natured rosy girl tapping him upon the shoulder what makes you look so serious Joe It is enough to make him look serious said James Evans the eldest boy here he is going to church on Easter Sunday in that old patched coat and we and everybody else have nice new ones 1 Well and will your nice new coat ojjve you nice new vuvs of saying your lessons tomorrow Joe need not mind his brown patch while he can read better than all the boys in the village I would sooner wear his old coat today than your crying faces tomorrow when you go to school as you always do without learning three words of your task James muttered something about being as clever as Joe and that Han nah had no business with his lessons but perceiving the arch girl was half inclined to laugh at him and well knowing how much Joe was his superior in learning he slunk behind with his brother and left his companions to proceed alone Joe felt relieved by their absence and although grateful for Hannahs interference could not help watching to discover if she noticed the brown patch Hannah however was a riri uf too much discernment to vue people for their dress and as she was well acquainted with Joes good qualities never thought of the colour of his coat At the church door they parted Joe took his usual seat near the clerks desk and notwithstanding he saw many eyes fixed upon his brown patch that should have been directed to their books he never blushed bat once and that was when a gentleman in the best pew looked earnestly at him and appeared to examine him from head to foot He does not know any harm of me thought Joe and he again turned to his Prayer book forgetting every thing but the place he was in and for what purpose he came there When the service concluded Joe was surrounded by his young acquaintances who while they asked trifling question or made some frivolous observations evinced by their eyes that his coat alone was the object of their attention His glow ing cheek betrayed him not quite at ease but his fathers words still dwelled upon his memory and he determined to conquer the silly pride he felt arising At this moment the gentleman who had before noticed him and who was Lord of the Manor approached with the parson of the parish The little groupe gave way each making a bow or curtsy all eager to catch the eye of the squire who graciously nodded to them but pointing to Joe enquired who the little boy in the patched coat belonged to Poor Joe once more looked at the brown patch nor was he the only one who did so He is the son of Farmer Hastings replied the parson one of the best children in the village and well worthy so good a father Farmer Hastings repeated the gentleman I remember him well but I fear from the appearance of his son times are not so well with him as heretofore The rector assented to this and as they walked through the church yard gave a slight detail of the honest farmers misfortunes Joe heard enough to make him proud of his father and regardless of his patched coat On reaching the turnstile Joe was about to proceed his usual way when Mr Martin the rector called him back and presented him by name to the Squire My good little fellow said the latter 1 have taken a great liking to patched coat of yours which I am told is worn by an excellent boy you however may little fellow I tare taken a to that patched coat of yours I am told is an excellent joy not be so partial to it so take this he added putting a banknote in his hand and let me see you next Sun day in a new one but retaining your present good character Hardly could Joe believe his senses as he viewed his newlygotten trea sure His thanks were warm but brief for every moment seemed an hour until he had imparted his good fortune to those he so dearly loved In vain James Evans and many others shouted after him to learn what the gentleman had given smiles and nods were his only answers Swift as the wind he crossed the fields and reached home just as Martha was taking the pudding out of the pot Just in time my boy said his father here is your favourite pud ding all smoking and ready for you u O I cant eat pu tiding or anything else just now returned Joe panting see father see Martha and all of ye see what the squire has just given me because my coat was patched with brown Joe then related particulars clear as his agitated spirits would allow produced his One Pound Note and kissing Martha declared he liked her mended coats better than new ones The farmer smiling congratulated him on his good luck and observed that a fair name was better than fine clothes as the event of the morning had proved Joe could eat little dinner for talk ing of the squire and his new coat until perceiving his father unusually thoughtful he forgot all his fine projects and enquired with real anxiety what he was thinking about I will tell you my dear replied he during the time you were at church neighbour Simms called to tell me that a great doctor was come to Ludlow famous for curing the deaf and dumb now I have more than once been told that our sweet Fanny might be cured if I had proper ad vice Well father interrupted Joe and you will now surely oh what luck that would be It would Joe be the greatest happiness of my life but then Ludlow is thirty six miles off and the ex pence of such a journey is more than 1 am worth in the world Joes color rose to crimson joy sparkled in his blue eye he clasped his hands in ecstasv Oh father my money my banknote would per haps Yes child that is what I am thinking of but then Joe the new coat for next Sunday and that old one with the ugly brown patch my boy But exclaimed Joe in tearful rapture my own Fanny to hear and speak to call me her dear brother to hear me tell her how much 1 love her understand all I could say to her ah father it would be too much Here overcome by his feelings Joe hid his face on his fathers shoulder and wept aloud The good farmer while he pressed him to his heart gave loose to similar feelings and poor Fanny the unconscious cause of them ran to share the grief she witnessed without knowing why Joe raised his head looked in her intelligent face and almost fancied her cure already began In the most affectionate manner she took his hand and in a kind of mournful tone en deavoured to console him Joe put his arms round her neck kissed her again and again uttering a thousand expressions of pleasure she smiled to observe though she understood him not When will you set off father enquired Joe Tomorrow morning by the heavy coach if the passengers be not too many it will pass here about five oclock and I doubt not we shall all be up early enough to secure a seat on the top for my poor girl and myself I dont think I shall so to bed to night said Joe for perhaps we might oversleep ourselves and really I feel too happy to sleep much nov but I might set heavy towards morning Never fear returned his father we shall all be up in time and I advise you to go to bed earlier than usual instead of sitting up all night for you will have more to do tomorrow on account of my absence Joe readily agreed to change his plan and retired soon after sunset happy as virtue and innocence could make him My readers will not be surprised to learn he was the first stirring in the cottage on the morrow helped Martha to prepare breakfast cleaned Fannys Sunday shoes and without being told ran half a mile to borrow dame Hudsons big shawl to wrap round his darling lest the dew should give her cold for it was early in April The farmer witnessed these affectionate attentions with a pleasure none but parents can feel and as he placed the banknote in an old leather purse prayed Heaven to bless his generous and dutiful boy Martha her two youngest brothers nd Joe walked to the end of the lane to see the travellers depart Joe continued kissing his hand while the coach was in sight his heart beat strong with hope though Martha more than once suggested the probability of their being disappointed Joe had double work to do on this day vet notwithstanding his constant occupation the time hung heavy and he longed for night to forget in sleep the doubts and fears to which suspence had given birth He had at first imagined that a single day would perfect Fannys cure and when un deceived by Martha experienced sad mortification he learnt with dismay that should the doctor even prove successful weeks months nay years might elapse ere their wishes were realized It is a very long while to wait for such happiness said he but come when it may it will be the joy of my life On the following day at noon the good man returned with his charge Joe was hard at work when he heard the distant sound of coach wheels throwing down the spade with which he had been digging the field he hastened up the lane shouting to Martha all the way The moment he discovered the dear objects of his search he stopped and fixed his eves on the countenance of his father the expression of which could not be mistaken all is right thought Joe while his heart palpitated as if it would burst through his breast Fanny looked pale from fatigue but her cheeks reddened with delight when she perceived who came to meet her His clamorous joy had brought the rest of tiic family to the garden and pushed forward to hear the first news but Joe suggested their assembling round the dinner table before his father began the interesting detail for Fanny had already warned him of her hunger The meal was speedily concluded and their delighted parent then in formed them that the doctor was of opinion she would recover both her hearing and speech but time only could evince the wished for success and the distance from Ludlow was too oreat to allow of so constant an attendance as was necessary I have no more pound notes I sighed Joe I wish the Squire had given two instead of one u Then you would have had a new coat into the bargain observed Martha looking significantly A new coat answered Joe somewhat indismantlv No l am not so selfish as to wish for more money oa that account I meant it would have paid fathers journey another time and two trials must be better than one Martha taking him affectionately by the hand owned her belief of his good intentions and told him if he would assist her in spinning during the next week she doubted not earn ing sufficient for a second journey Three weeks passed away in anxious expectation Farmer Hastings had been several times to Ludlow little Fanny underwent an operation which produced a slight sense of hearing and the joy of the whole family was sincere as ardent On the fourth Sunday Joe went to church in his old jacket a second patch was no improvement to its appearance but he saw not its defects he only remembered it had been the means of sending Fanny to Ludlow and moreover she had given proofs of hearing the church bells that morn ing their sound now seemed the sweetest music to his ears his spi rits became elated as he listened to them lie was stripping a bunch of May from the hedge to place in his breast when he heard his name pronounced in a tone of surprise he raised his head and beheld the squire his eyes steadily fixed on his party coloured jacket Joe instantly understood his thoughts but had not the immediate power of speaking his eye fell on the same object and glanced from the patch to the squire alternately His confused manner and blushing cheeks gave the squire an idea that all was not right and he rather abruptly enquired why he again saw him in his old coat Because sir because I thought it best kindest to spend your money an something else that 1 could not help wanting much more than a nev coat I think you could not want any thing so necessary returned the squire you have a good father who feeds and maintains you and I hope you are too good a boy to throw away such a sum on trifles or in purchasing anything without your fathers know ledge O no indeed sir that would be very wicked I have certainly spent the note you were so kind as to give me but I am sure that is I think you would not say I had done wrong if you knew all Well then tell me all I am in clined to think well of you from your seeming good conduct and the good character parson Martin gives but I do not like concealment if the money has been disposed of properly you need not be ashamed to own the manner of laying it out So Joe thought but his natural modesty made him averse to disclosing an action in which he was the prin cipal person concerned and in pro portion as the squire pressed for an explanation his reluctance increased at length he stammered out the truth attributing the whole to his fathers suggestion but his gratified auditor readily understood the merit of the action was entirely his own and be stowed the warmest commendations on his dutiful conduct he added I shall call on your father this even ing and talk to him on the subject The naturally sanguine disposition of our rustic hero attached much good fortune to this promised visit and he hastened to impart his hopes to his parent and sister Joe thought evening would never arrive it did however and with it came the squire and his lady The neatness so evident in the farmers cottage and family made a most favourable impression upon his guests who condescendingly noticed all they saw and enquired minutely into their tenants affairs The squire heard with real pleasure a confirmation of Joes good qualities and at the con clusion of the fathers recital of his generous offer of the banknote took him by the hand and promised to be friend him through life Then perhaps exclaimed Joe joyfully I shall be able to earn enough to get dear Fanny quite cured 51 t We shall not wait your future exertions my worthy boy answered the squire Fanny has found a more able though not a better friend in this lady who has come here purposely to offer her services on her account solelv Yes said the lady smiling and drawing the interesting little girl to wards her I mean to take your favourite under my particular care I shall send her to Ludlow at my own expense to reside with Doctor Alason who has several other unfortunate children under his care and 1 doubt not from your fathers favourable re port she will return as well as we could hope her to be Poor Joe could only turn up his hands and eyes in wonder at such goodness while his father and Martha returned more audible thanks A small but compact farm was of fered tdiMicr Hastings at a rent not exceeding his present humble one and the squires lady assured Martha she would furnish her with many com forts and necessaries for housekeep ing such as they had been deprived of from change of fortune They at length quitted the cottage overwhelmed with the gratitude of its worthy inhabitants whose coming prosperity soon spread through the village to the mutual pleasure of all for farmer Hastings w as universally respected and beloved In the course of the following week little Fanny was completely equipped for her new residence The parting between her and Joe was truly affect ing though the latter convinced of its necessity endeavoured to suppress his feelings and to make her comprehend it was for the best Never had Joe shed so many tears as on the morning of her departure it seemed he lost halt himself in losing his dar ling and the poor little girl suffered still more from her ignorance of all which occasioned the separation As the summer advanced happiness once more beamed upon this worthy family They had removed to the new farm the bountiful hand of their landlord rendered every thing complete Marthas dairy and Joes garden were the admiration of the village every Saturday Joe was al lowed to accompany the squires housekeeper in a chaise cart to Ludlow and had the inexpressible pleasure of seeing his sister who rapidly recovered under the skilful management of Doctor Mason This weekly holiday was procured by extra labour on other days but the toil was a pleasure to our tenderhearted Joe As he had been the chief object of her love in the days of affliction he became the dearest one as she gained sense and power of expressing the same Every month he had some instance to relate of her improvement in speech and when she first addressed him though imperfectly as dear Joe his heart seemed too full of delight to be borne and he threw himself on her bosom in an agony of joy As he reached the farm on this memorable evening he exclaimed Oh my dear father oh Martha she said would you believe it she said Here his throat swelled and he could say no more Who do you mean my child M asked his father noticing his agitation with anxiety Mean why I mean Fanny our Fanny my own Fanny yes dear father she spoke to me called me dear Joe such sweet words I never heard in my life they have sounded in my ears all the way home every tree every bush seemed to repeat dear Joe I shall never think of any other words as long as I live es my dear boy you must think of and repeat other words words of grateful praise to the Merciful Power who has restored our dear Fanny and loaded us with benefits nor let us forget his agents in the good work whose charity guided by His AilPowerful Hand has brought things to this happy conclusion O I shall never forget them or their goodness returned the tearful boy and as to thanking God for all he has done for us I think it would be almost impossible for he sends new happiness every day but indeed I do think of him and say my prayers with all rny heart because i always fancy he is listening to me and it makes my heart feel light especially when I have been to see clear Fanny and find her better for I am sure it must be His Power that makes her so I believe you my child said far mer Hastings and may His Good ness ever inspire you with the same confidence 1 Autumn passed laboriously but happily every thing prospered all their efforts succeeded but Winter was destined to complete their felicity little Fanny came to spend a fortnight at the farm remembered each individual and the scene of her early ha bits called her brothers and sister by name heard most of what was said to her and listened with rapture to Joes attempt to entertain her with his fife which the squires butler had given him Joe was half wild with pleasure he escorted her throughout the lae busied himself in forming new plans of amusement and read him self hoarse to divert her with Little Red RidingHood MotherGoose and every book he possessed or could borrow from his young companions Joe had long since owned a new coat likewise a jacket for days of labour but he yet retained the patched one which he esteemed a relic and termed it the lucky jae ket On the day of Fannys return the jubilee of his life he appeared in the patched garb at dinner On Marthas joking him he observed No matter I would not affront my brown patch by letting it lie un noticed in the old chest on such a day as this when I remember that all our good fortune comes from its colour Ah Martha I dont forgot old friends and although 1 certainly like to wear my new coat best and go to church like other boys of the village yet I have a great respect for this workmanship of yours Blue jackets and brown patches for ever blue jackets and brown patches for ever repeated the laughing Fanny not quite perfect indeed but intelligibly enough to be understood by all I will wear this dear patch all the rest of my life sobbed Joe as he kissed her round blushing cheek Wear the same heart my noble boy said his father and you must be happy Thus ends my story said Susan closing the book and I hope it has entertained you very much indeed returned Charles 1 am quite delighted with Joe and as to poor little Fanny do you know I could not help crying when you described her misfortunes My eyes dont feel quite right observed Susan but I believe you are as much the cause as poor Fanny for while I read of Joes affectionate conduct towards her I could not but fancy that you would just behave as kind to me had I been as unfortunate as the poor little girl Charles felt she did him but justice and squeezed her hand grate fully as she patted his pale cheek In a few minutes subsequent Su sans patient was slumbering and our butterfly concluding the careful nurse would remain too quiet to afford him further entertainment set off in quest of new adventures In making a sudden turn to the left he found himself in a much busier scene than any he had hitherto witnessed it was a country town and the bustle of business and clamour of tongues overwhelmed him with surprise and confusion The shops were gay and every countenance looked cheerful yet however amusing the novel spectacle to our winged traveller he beheld no promise of sustenance but one source met his view and that was a honey suckle creeping round the doorframe of a dirty shop and so discoloured by dust that he felt his appetite must be keen indeed ere he could venture on such food The glowing colours of some ribbons in a haberdashers window 7 attracted him but alas they were articles only pleasing to the eye The next shop was a pastry cooks and decorated in a most tempting style few juvenile observers could have viewed it without a wish for some of its contents but children and butterflies differ in point of taste custards jellies and cakes had no charms for our butterfly who flew from house to house street to street in search of the beauties of nature A row of small houses with flower gardens in front presented a more pleasing prospect and he determined to avail himself of the opportunity There was no great variety but rose trees were not wanting and he quickly selected the most blooming At the moment of his choice a mischievous boy who was passing through the garden with a basket containing eggs and butter perceived his manoeuvre and threw his hat with so good an aim that the rose taster fell direct to the earth and was taken prisoner without a struggle Held by the wing he was carried to a shop in the town where the urchin placed him on the counter and began to amuse himself by roughly checking his progress whenever renovated strength permitted him to crawl He continued this employment in spite of his masters repeated orders to go on a second errand and at length roused his employer to give him a smart rap on the head Insensible as he was to the sufferings of the poor insect in his power he was perfectly alive to his own and quickly retreated from a second blow leaving his victim at liberty but half dead from fright and illusage The shopkeeper discovering the cause of the boys negligence brush ed it hastily from the counter and with a force that sent it into the street This new shock had nearly proved our persecuted heros last he just retained strength enough to creep to the wall where sheltered from the foot of the passing passenger he slowly recovered in a decree but his wing had received too much injury for present flight and he felt all the horrors of approaching annihilation but fate had other evils in store and shortly after he was raised gently by a soft careful hand while a still softer voice uttered exclamations of real feeling for his unfortunate situation The fair speaker was one of a large party forming a young ladies 1 school and with a companion being the last of the train had leisure to rescue the poor butterfly exposed to the danger of being crushed by some heedless footstep After a short walk they stopped at a large house at the extremity of the town and our butterfly was taken into the schoolroom and exhibited to the youthful circle by his new mistress who suffered not a finger to touch her prize whose weakness she observed but too plainly shewed how harshly he had been used e What will you do with it asked one Set it at liberty when it is strong enough to fly returned she 1 am sorry evening is so fast advancing had it been earlier I would have at tempted to copy its pretty form and bright colors ibr I never remember to have seen so beautiful a butterfly Well cannot you put it in a box until tomorrow morning saki Harriet Jones no harm could hap pen to it there and I really think it would make a pretty drawing and you are so clever at mixing your colors and laying them on smoothly I am sure you would succeed in this But how cruel it would be Harriet to confine the poor thing in L close box a whole night for the chaiKJ or copying it tomorrow and I ai sure a very poor chance it would he for I doubt if it will survive hours if any thing can save it air and freedom will and I should be sorry to deprive it of the only re medy What a fuss about a butterfly cried a new voice Jones is right I would put it into a box if it is past recovery there can be no cruelty in confining it The butterfly owner turned with quickness to the last speaker and addressing her in a tone of feeling said When your father was so se verely wounded in battle think what would have been his fate had those around him shut him up in a close room without the benefit of air or necessary assistance he must in that case have died I have heard him tell papa how the freshness of the breeze and warmth of the sun contributed to his recovery and yet you knowing this would unthinkingly deprive a living creature of both be cause it cannot tell you how necessary they are to its existence Miss Simpson blushed and looked a little angry for she valued Lucys good opinion and felt that there was truth in what she said But there was a great difference she observed in killing a soldier and a butterfly 5 Certainly replied Lucy and I would rather a thousand of the handsomest were destroyed than a single human being but I dont see why we should shorten the life of any thing God has created nor would you I am assured give pain to a living creature if you took time to reflect Miss Simpson stammered out a kind of apology for what she had said but it was evident she was more mortified by her friends rebuke than sorry for her own want of humanity Not so the rest of her companions who were unanimous in advising Lucy to give the butterfly its liberty add ing she always acted for the best To the best of my weak judgment you mean returned the blush ing girl What are you saying to Miss Saville that occasions her to blush so much enquired the governess advancing to the gathering circle Only giving her due praise ma dam answered one and of course speaking the truth That is a handsome compliment my dear returned the smiling preceptress and must be as grateful to my young friend as it is honorable in you to acknowledge her merits but may 1 ask what was the circumstance which gave rise to your eulogium Here Lucy stepped forward with her butterfly fearful lest her partial fiierods should mention Miss Simpson in an unfavorable manner and sim ply related the cause of her school fellows approbation It was but a simple act of humanity madam and I really do not feel deserving the praise bestowed You could not do other than what you have done replied her go verness and with you I think it is not an extraordinary act of humanity but my love it is the remembrance of your usual good conduct which this circumstance brought to recollection that excited the commendation of your friend Martha and you now feel the pleasing consequences of being uni formly kind and humane Lucy blushed and was silent her companions thought they never saw her look so pretty for she possessed little of personal beauty Mrs Bedford seated herself and the delighted girls gathered round her Humanity she continued is so natural a feeling and so constantly brings its own reward it seems strange that an v human being should resist its call Few I believe are entirely void of it but we often confine our sympathy to the sufferings of the human species alone this is certainly selfish for while we sympathize with our fellow creatures we in a great measure lament the psin we are liable to experience ourselves The brute creation are entitled to our pity and forbearance in a particular degree for they want intellect to discern danger and are even in our power and consequently at our mercy I never knew a cruel child make an amiable man or woman To hurt a dumb animal or crush an inoffensive insect betrays cowardice as well as cruelty because the perpetrator knows the victim cannot contend with the ingenuity of man You may remember my dear Miss Simp son the postboy who beat his horses so severely the day you returned to school I then felt assured inhuma nity was not his only failing and have since learned that from his repeated illusage of his masters horses he was discharged want of character prevented his entering a new service idleness led him into bad society and he is now in the county gaol for rob bing a shop in this town His friends are to be pitied for they are honest and laborious people but you or I can feel little pity ior him when we recollect his savage treatment of the poor fatigued animal who had travelled so far for his and your convenience Miss Simpson readily assented to tliis though she cast her eyes fearfully around to observe if her companions were making comparisons several eyes were turned towards her but quickly withdrawn when they noticed her confusion Mrs Bedford went on You must all notice the particular confidence I repose in Hannah the servant who attends YOU while at meals and when sick I do not however believe that the v hole of my young friends are acquainted with the circumstances which first gave me a knowledge of her She is the daughter of a poor but worthy cottager in the neighbouring village and from infancy inclined to habits of industry and docility That her heart is tender and affectionate 1 imagine I need not add for many present have experienced her kind attentions in sick ness Yes Yes exclaimed several voices together she is indeed a tenderhearted nurse as we can prove Well my dears this kindness of nature extended to every thing living that was not hurtful to mankind and few little girls treated dumb animals better than Hannah Bennett She was nearly eleven years old when coming into the town one morning to dispose of her mothers knitting she saw some boys engaged in earnest conversation near a pond they appeared to be examining something and curiosity led her to cross the road to discover the object of their attention Her feeling heart recoiled on perceiving it was a poor frog whose death they were planning with every species of cruelty she pleaded strongly for its release but they laughed at her humanity for a frog and desired more she quitted the admiring circle and with more philosophy than might be expected from so youthful a heroine set forward on her journey She stopped but once more and that was to spend the shopkeepers halfpenny in liquorice for her grand mothers cough In passing the church she noticed with pleasure that only half an hour had elapsed since she quitted the boys and she Mattered herself it could not be too late Her hopes somewhat diminished as she drew near the pond and saw no one in sight it might be however they were in the adjoining field and she hastened to where there was a gap in the hedge to ascertain if it were so but alas no boys were there She approached the pond and with horror discovered the man led remains of a frog which she felt convinced was the poor victim she had wished to pre serve Indignation pity and self reproach combined to overwhelm her with regret and she burst into a violent flood of tears The remainder of her journey was slowly performed she accused herself of inhumanity and sincerely regretted she had been tempted to stop for the foolish grotto Within a few yards of home she overtook one of the hardhearted party and reproached him for his conduct I cant help it replied he I wanted them to wait for your penny but they all agreed you were only joking and would not be so foolish as to give a penny for the sake of an ugly frog Why you were not out of sight when they killed it Hannah turned from him in dis gust but felt relieved in learning her dilatoriness had not accelerated the cruel deed She was now a penny the richer but her wealth gave her no pleasure and although the showman passed through the village on the succeeding clay she experienced not the slightest inclination to peep at the grotto on the contrary it only awakened fresh regret Her luckless penny was be stowed upon a poor blind man and her heart felt lighter when it was gone Hannahs grandfather who occasionally worked in my garden told the story to one of the servants and in course of time it reached my ears I was pleased with the childs character and requested to see her Still more was I won by her modest recital and ingenuous condemnation of her self I immediately took her into the house had her instructed in useful knowledge for her situation in life and she has ever since remained with me and is at this time a pattern of domestic fidelity and a treasure to my establishment I was convinced a heart so good might be trained to the best principles and the trial has more than fulfilled my hope This morning she informed me of a circumstance that shocked though it did not surprise me one of the frog tormentors was no other than the unfeeling postboy we were speaking of just now Her youthful auditors listened with the greatest interest and attention and while they did justice to the me rits of Hannah Bennett expressed their abhorrence of the post boys character But where is vour beautiful but terfly Miss Saville exclaimed a little girl perceiving it was no longer on the table Gone I protest answered Lucy looking round the room no matter it must have recovered its strength wonderfully to have flown away I rejoice the poor thing re vived it was not my intention to keep it a moment longer than its weakness required He was too proud to be nursed by me and all mv good intentions are now vain Our butterfly however was not so far oft as Lucy imagined he had certainly regained his strength in a greater degree than might be expected but was yet too weak to fly and had only crawled to one of the windows on whose sill he rested while Mrs Bedford related Hannah Bennetts history In a few r minutes subsequent the good lady bade her pupils adieu for the night their respectful affection towards her bespoke how much she was beloved and our flighty traveller was half inclined to tarry a little longer with this amiable family but it is the nature of butterflies to rove and the ensuing breeze helped to expand his wings he made an effort and reached a bed of mignionette growing beneath the window here he was joined by a grave looking brown and yellow insect whose external appearance was not particularly striking but there was much courtesy in his manner and the two strangers quickly entered into conversation My friend said the yellow butterfly you appear to be in a weak state is it from natural infirmity or from recent misfortune Alas returned our hero my weakness arises from the cruelty of Ill the human race and not from any affliction of nature I have but just escaped the most barbarous treatment and it is only by the most un expected kindness of a young lady that I am so far recovered as you see me Well replied the other you see the wisdom and kindness of Providence who sent you a benefactor in one of the same species as your persecutor I should imagine he continued that your adventures have not been of a common description butterflies of your colour and form are highly estimated your beauty must have attracted mankind very often and this sort of admiration must have led you into danger and circumstances highly interesting true you are young but I doubt not have witnessed more of the world than many double your age Why to speak the truth answered the flattered beau I have seen a little of life but my knowledge is rather confined for I have moved in a limited sphere I am not more than three miles from my native home a garden so humble you would smile to see its produce at the same time experience has fatally convinced me that neither wealth nor luxury can insure happiness In the course of this day I have revelled among the finest flowers have sported round beautiful china vases and contemplated my own form in mirrors of magnificent structure but my enjoyments were not perfect constant and fearful interruptions destroyed the pleasure within my grasp and I have sutiered a martyrdom in escaping the mischievous and inhuman pranks of children more than ever 1 now regret leaving the peaceful spot that gave me birth the humble cot tage of my first friends was a complete sanctuary and the natural good ness of its youthful inhabitants would never have subjected me to personal danger It is a common fault observed his new acquaintance not to estimate true happiness until it is out of our reach I regret one so young as yourself should find the truth thus early I must acknowledge my curiosity is not a little raised to learn the nature of your perambulations and if the relation be not too painful I would solicit to hear them i am afraid you will be disappointed returned our adventurer but I feel no hesitation in complying He then related the history with which our readers are already acquainted and received the thanks of his hearer for what he was pleased to term an interesting detail Perhaps said the narrator you would oblige me with a similar ac count your knowledge of the world seem infinitely superior to mine and from our age I should judge you must have much more to recount My life has been pretty well chequered answered the stranger but I doubt if its incidents would afford much entertainment as you may perceive my beauty is not very remarkable 1 belong to a common tribe and of course have never attracted the notice of your peacocks eve folks at the same time I am aware this want of personal charms has proved a blessing to me in many instances Children are usually attracted by shewy objects my dull colours have often passed unheeded where your brilliant ones would have invited a chase To tell you every event of inv existence would give ou very little satisfaction my connections are very different from yours I can boast little or ancestry the head of our family was of the skull tribe and you may suppose not an Adonis however I believe he was a well meaning butterfly and less frivolous than we are said to be in general I received a hurt in one of my wings when in infancy which has greatly retarded my flight ever since and frequently placed me in danger I should not otherwise have encountered once indeed it had liked to have ended fatally I had entered a room on the runner of a honeysuckle that grew over a trellis and so occupied by my pleasure that I did not perceive several young ladies drawing at a table when 1 first made the dis cover I was somewhat alarmed for I was ever afraid of the human race but as they pursued their study very quietly I took courage and by degrees ventured to the edge of a glass in which one of the party occasion ally dipped her camels hair pencil she was painting a group of flowers and imitated nature so well I could not help watching her delicate fingers in admiration while thus employed another young artist twitched me from the glass exclaiming Louisa here is a young gentleman wishes to sit for his likeness cannot you introduce him in your group of roses I dont think he would much im prove the beauty of my drawings answered she smiling for I will do him justice he is the plainest butterfly I ever saw his wings look so mean and his colours so dead Aye poor thing said another and I dare say he is almost dead with fright I am not hurting him I assure you said my keeper I hold him as lightly as possible he would intrude himself as a beau and I wish to mortify his vanity but since Louisa has not taste enough to admire him I will send him adrift immediately yet really I do not think it would be but kind to alter his dress a little and if we cannot make him hand some make him gay at least so saying she took a dip from every colour on her palette and spotted my dead looking yellow jacket as she called it the process was gently performed all the injury I sustained was mortification never was a beau more completely humiliated Her companions laughed most heartily I endeavoured to get away and she instantly released me but my wings were heavy with ray new habiliments and this added to the natural infirmity before mentioned checked my motion materially At length the paint dried I felt lighter and was able to fly you may judge I soon quitted this scene of ridicule and to me vexation I heard the laugh at my expence long after my departure and certainly owed the origin of my disgrace no good will In defiance of the young artists assertion I must assert I never was vain or the least inclined to be a beau yet strange to say I felt a kind of Buttering plea sure when I observed the notice my new dress created among our own species various were the opinions as to my origin Most extraordinary said one What tribe does he belong to asked a second I really cannot say returned the in sect applied to I never beheld any thing like him before Depend upon it observed one of your class he is a foreigner I have heard there are some of us of strange shape and colour in other climates and I declare he is not the least like any of our English butterflies I begin to think he is of French origin you know they are reckoned rather whimsical in their dress and like variety of colours only that I am ashamed to betray my ignorance of the language I would address him Flimsy you must know a little of it born as you were in a garden attached to a French boarding school True but my accent is so indifferent Never mind your accent a truce with conceit go to this singular stranger and address him boldly All this conversation I heard as I rested on a wallflower and must own I never was better entertained I was aware that too close an inspection would betray the real quality of my attire and therefore determined to act accordingly Mr Flimsy flew round and round my resting place several times ere he had courage to open his negociation at length he approached and began Dou venez vous Monsieur I am no French scholar but I just knew enough for my purpose stretching out my wings I answered as I bounced by the astonished ambassador Bon soir Monsieur bon soir Never did I behold a butterfly so disconcerted all his learning fled at once slowly he returned to his expectant friends I did not wait to witness their surprise but taking a different direction was soon out of Our hero laughed heartily at whimsicality of this adventurer and enquired how he lost his painted adornments The worst part of the story is to come replied the other after shewing off in borrowed colours I entered a curious building decorated with various specimens of natural curiosities among the rest was a glass case containing a most beautiful collection of our kind golden wings with variegated borders peacocks eyes of wonderful brightness though I as sure you 1 do not flatter when 1 assert you are one of the rarest of your kind Here our butterfly of course made his bow I stood looking at the interesting spectacle and not a little amused by my own grotesque appearance which the lid of the case reflected when raising my eyes I beheld a thin bent little old gentleman pale as that lily his features were harsh and disagree able his dress had once been fine but then wore a tarnished and shabby hue his large wig nearly reached to his nose on which was placed huge spectacles through them he was steadily gazing at something in what I afterwards learned was a micros cope So extraordinary a figure I had ne ver seen and I could not help indulging myself with a survey of his per son No doubt you have guessed his pursuits and his title he was a rr tuoso to us a dreadful name When the trutlr presented itself to my imagination I instantly determined to re treat but alas it was too late he had already discovered me but so cautiously did he set about securing me that I Was perfectly unconscious of his purpose until I felt the excruciating torture of a silver pin through my lame wing which fixed me to the frame of the glass case He raised and wiped his spectacles a dozen times ere he inspected me smiling with the most malignant joy as he viewed my painful struggles e Bless me bless me what a treasure have I found all my years of travel and vast sums expended never procured its equal Here is every color of the rainbow combined wonderful phenomenon of nature Well now I would not give my collection for any other in Europe My Lord Moth head will he quite astonished when he sees this curious insect Really I have a great mind yes I think nay I positively will offer this to the British Museum I shall make my fortune no sum would be too much for such a unique HP then examined me anew and Repeated his admiration in terms so extravagant that had I not been suffering the most torturing agony I must have laughed at his folly I verily believe he thought himself the most fortunate of the human race Little did the merry girl who thus embellished my external appearance imagine the distress her freak had brought on me The delighted virtuoso was interrupted in the height of enthusiasm by a person equally remarkable with him self though in a different way His figure was immensely tall and thin his face the longest I remember to have seen his coat was evidently a castoff one of his masters for he was an assistant and kind of secretary to the old gentleman and of course the habit of a little man could not suit a very tall one the sleeves did not reach to his wrist by some inches and the collar corresponded with the sleeves he carried a small board on which were fastened a number of beetles he had been polishing Come hither Nathaniel Lap wing cried the master here is a sight you could never have hoped to see such a butterfly man such a natural curiosity that I am almost wild with joy when I reflect I am the happy naturalist to whose lot it has fallen Curious indeed replied Nathaniel it is of a garb 1 never beheld what does your honour mean to do with it Aye my friend that is the question I am rather undecided how to act whether to keep it for my own rare collection or present it to the President of the British Museum I might surely ask a handsome price for it So it should seem returned the other drily but you may remember they did not receive your offer of the wonderful cockleshell to your liking and pronounced it a common shell although you declared it was found on the shores of the Gold Coast in Africa i Yes yes I know that I remember that very well Nathaniel not that they doubted my judgment even then but anybody might be mistaken in a cockleshell as young the managers of the Museum were but I defy all the learned and the greatest naturalists in Europe to disavow their belief of this insect being a real curiosity Here are wings Nathaniel blue red yellow stars spots in short all that can astonish and gratify the eye of taste Nathaniel agreed to this and added the wings were entirely different This pointing to the pinioned one has but three spots the other has four nay five As he spoke he touched the admired spot with the end of his finger when behold the chief part of the fine red came away on his nail He stood aghast then touched it a second time and in so doing removed the whole of the color Why what is this exclaimed he in dis may can it be possible that all these fine tints are put on Put on repeated the virtuoso no no it is impossible let me see let me try He did so and the imposition was too palpable to admit of a doubt His rage now equalled his late admiration and he vowed vengeance against me and those who had played the trick for he fully believed it was done to deceive him alone Nathaniel experienced much of his masters mortification but he possessed more humanity for he instantly released me and blew me off his hand into the garden You may conceive my feelings on this unexpected deliverance I felt grateful to the man while I despised his master and sincerely prayed I might never again come within sight of a virtuoso The cause of my calamity had nearly disappeared from the rough experiments of Nathaniel and I took care to rub myself well among the dewy grass so that the remainder of my painted finery was soon effaced Not so my poor wing the in jury it had received has never been entirely remedied and I am at this lime I believe the worst aeronaut among our species This incident my friend is an excellent lesson to the vain and if ever I had been of the number could not fail of making due impression 44 Jt is indeed a lesson returned our peacock butterfly and one that I feel particularly for I must con fess beauty has ever possessed too much of my consideration and I have brought myself into more than one dilemma through this same weak feeling It shows your good sense to ac knowledge it said his new friend and I only wish all our race were as sensible of their errors We are generally remarked for conceit and I am afraid with truth enough but I trust there are some exceptions I envy you your discernment observed the other you see every thing in its proper point of view it is doubly hard you should have suffered for wearing the semblance of attraction when you were wise enough to be happy without the reality 1 Perhaps so but I assure you I am not so faultless as you imagine If I have disregarded appearance I have thought too much of my appetite or to speak more plainly I have been a complete epicure for it was not the quantity so much as the quality of the food that I considered and I have frequently turned in disgust from what I now blush to think did not perfectly satisfy me Nothing like experience my friend I now enjoy the humblest food far more than ever I did the rarities once so coveted I shall never forget my first meal on a potato blossom You smile and no doubt think little of my taste but I positively affirm it is a delicious food Like you I once held it cheap but meeting with a butterfly of Irish extraction he undeceived me it certainly required some persuasion to induce a trial on my part but I was amply repaid by making it I had one morning over feasted myself on a sunflower and like epicures of greater magnitude felt dis agreeable consequences and loathed all food during that day The sight of luxury disgusted me and I quitted a rich flower garden to wander through dusty roads and grass worn fields became drowsy arid indulged myself with a nap On awaking I found my appetite reviving and looked sharp around to discover if food was at hand The prospect was barren indeed and 1 was regretting my precipitancy in quitting the comforts of my mornings residence when a stranger butterfly accosted me There was a civility and agreeableness in his manner which invited confidence and I readily returned his salutation He told me his parents were natives of Hibernia and that he entertained a great respect for their country from his knowledge of their worth he did not account for their coming to this country which circumstance I own surprised me for I could not conceive how they travelled knowing there is a vast extent of water between Ireland and England however curiosity is not one of my failings consequently I did not enquire too minutely into his family affairs He had seen much of the world and had been by no means an idle spectator of its scenes His observations were remarkably shrewd and I really enjoyed his society the anecdotes he related would form a very amusing history I suggested this to him and advised him to publish his adventures And who would read the adventures of a butterfly answered he no no mankind have too many trifling pursuits of their own to be interested in those of a wandering in sect Bless you my friend this is the age for scribbling and if a roar but take a walk in his own grounds he sits down to write a foreign tour performed at home I smiled at this account of the human race for I had never made such deep observations lie noticed my weakness and enquired the cause I was ashamed to confess the source of my indisposition and merely said I had been ill from indigestion but was just then suffering from hunger We will soon get rid of the latter complaint answered he laughing just cross the road with me I will en sure you a treat for an emperor You may suppose I did not hesitate to accept this invitation but judge my surprise when I found the blossom of his country fruit was to be the royal food He saw my astonishment but was not at all offended on the contrary I could perceive he enjoyed my embarrassment he flew merrily from a blossom to blossom humming a lively air which he called Shamrock for ever I was a little mortified by this indifference and inclined to scorn the vulgar feast but whether it was shame hunger his good humour or all combined I know not certain it is I changed my mind and never was more satisfied with a meal before or since From that time I lost mv relish for luxuries and soon acquired a rational and humble appetite I shall ever retain a grateful remembrance of my shamrock friend as I now call him for I may thank bin for many a pleasant unmolested meal and better health than I enjoyed previous to our meeting We afterwards journeyed together several minutes during which I heard several curious particulars respecting his family his father was remarkable for the beauty of his form and colours a distinction that cost him his life he now adorns a celebrated noblemans collection in Lon don His mother met a melancholy end likewise she was skimming the surface of a bowl of milk when her feet sank in too deep to be extricated and the fair Hibernian was drowned It is rather a singular circumstance that the lady butterflys grandmother N lost her life in a similar way viz in a bowl of buttermilk Had you heard the feeling and interesting manner in which he re counted these sad events you would have felt the most lively sensibility I really never sympathized with any one out of my own connexion so sincerely But I remember while he was on the subject our ears were at tacked by the most extraordinary and alarming sounds I fluttered every limb He listened awhile and then jocosely said it was only the voices of some Irish labourers returning from work I was glad to find it was no worse but could not divest myself of alarm any thing so harsh 1 never heard He said the language was expressive but to me it was past expression I was a stranger even to the brogue He understood much of what they said and followed to hear more I loitered behind in the hope of his return for I felt a great desire to be better acquainted But all my wishes died away on perceiving the old virtuoso leaning on Nathaniel turn the corner of the lane within a few yards of me Horror seized my every nerve and I exerted my strength to the utmost to get to a distance not daring to look behind until compelled to stop from weakness I then dis covered my enemy at too great a distance to allow of fear and began to lament the separation from my entertaining acquaintance whom I regret to say I never saw more I some times fear he might fall into the hands of my cruel enemy for his appearance was certainly much in his favor but it is lo be hoped my fears are un founded and that he is now enjoying the benefit of his good qualities and lively disposition I am not very gaily inclined and do not covet much society but it is pleasant now and then to meet a kindred mind such as yours and Shamrocks I feel obliged by the compliment returned our hero and must beg leave to say the pleasure is chiefly mine for until I met you I never knew the sweets of friendship reciprocal communication is certainly one of the sweetest delights of life You are right such communications are a treat but how surfeiting the commonplace conversations of butterflies in general I remember in an excursion I once made meeting a troop of our species on a tour of pleasure as they termed it nothing would satisfy them but my joining the party 1 did so reluctantly want ing courage to repress their urgent 5 entreaties They were most of them of your kind and certainly made a dashing appearance I was rather surprised my plain person should have attracted the notice of such gay folks but I soon discerned that it was my homely figure that produced the invitation two or three fancied themselves wits and were determined to divert them at my expense However mortified I might feel in making this discovery I had prudence enough to conceal my feelings One enquired if shabby brown and dingy yellow were the most fashionable colors to which another replied there had certainly been an attempt to make them so but it had failed and the offended class were about to emigrate to some newly discovered island where the sun never shined and where the dimness of their charms would not be so easily discerned This specimen of butterfly with greatly charmed the party who one and all joined in the laugh begging I would not control my merriment out of good breed ing To this I answered I could not enter into the joke because I did not believe the report I was myself one of the tribe described and so far from being fashionists we always laughed at the ridiculous figure other classes made in endeavouring to ape mankind What classes do you mean asked a pert beau More than one replied I but I leave it to your own conscience whether yours be included in the number He looked a little abashed and indeed they all seemed the graver for my retort but vanity is not easily quelled though it may be often checked We entered a beautiful garden belonging to a lady of high rank who with some friends was enjoying the fragrance of the various gifts of Flora Some of our youthful companions were desirous of showing off on this occasion and quitting the party advanced towards the great folks before whom they ew to and fro in all the pride of conscious beauty Their gratification however was short the charms they prized drew the attention they desired but the re sult was not of so pleasing a nature Two young gentlemen commenced a chance after our stragglers they were not novices at the game for they soon caught and destroyed four of the fairest You may imagine the effect such a scene caused in the survivor who quickly left the hateful place in distress of mind that erased all my for mer contempt but I had no desire to continue the association and took the first opportunity of changing my quarters Except in this one adventure I never mixed with butterflies of rank nor can I say a desire for high life was the consequence Observe I do not wish to treat the great with disrespect but I own I look for something more than ancestry where I wish to esteem And you are right my friend re plied our hero for myself I knew not the value of aw own descent until I heard the remarks of some strangers I met this morning Nor can I say the knowledge of it has increased my happiness for it created a vanity I never should have felt but for the injudicious admiration I cannot ex press how much I am bettered by your good sense and just observations how I wish we might pass the remainder of life together I really feel we were born for friends I see no possible objection to your wishes said the yellow butterfly nay I am assured we shall both be hap pier by joining society and while we enjoy ourselves be enabled to assist the young and giddy by warning them of evils we have escaped and teaching them how to profit by our example Agreed returned the other from this time let one common fate unite us and let our interests and pursuits be the same Each flapped his wing three times in token of agreement and the matter was settled Night now drew on apace and as our butterflies were not of that species travel in darkness they retiree to rest the tulip afforded a comfortable shelter where they enjoyed a re pose kings might have envied Our friends were awakened early the ensuing morning by the clamour of many tongues the noise of which rather alarmed them but the subject of these memoirs soon discovered the truth and in the busy group approaching recognized Mrs Bedfords pupils he imparted this to his companion and they both emerged from their couch to observe the pursuits of the juvenile party whose characters were high in the estimation of each from the event of the preceding evening As it will be necessary to distinguish the two butterflies thus united from one another we shall call our own hero by the name the vand brown one bestowed him friend Peacock from the peculiar beauty of his coat as before ob served Peacock pointed out to his friend the amiable Miss Saville and her young advocate They were together and examining every new blown flower with the greatest interest O Lucy exclaimed the young one look at this beautiful moss rose how it is broken who can have done it I hope no one intentionally answered Lucy for we all admired it so much yesterday I should think it impossible any lady would destroy what they so lately prized All in a breath denied having injured the flower but Miss Savilles discernment induced her to suspect the sincerity of one and she proposed asking each separately the supposed aggressor looked a little confused but assuming courage as her turn drew near boldly denied the action Miss Saville fixed her eyes on the countenance of the young Julia and begged her to reflect a little ere she answered in the negative Why so Miss returned the other pertly I can give no other answer and I think it is very spiteful of you to fix it on me No 7 not spiteful cried several voices Lucy is never spiteful I hope not said Miss Saville gently Nor do I think Julia would say so if she was not angry with me However as I have certainly raised suspicion against her I feel in honour bound to give my reason for so doing Well then yesterday when we were quitting the garden Julia wished to pick a nosegay and among other tiouers selected a rose from this tree Now we all know it is a favourite of dear Mrs 13ed fords and I therefore objected to her taking one observing there were plenty of other roses to suit her purpose She was offended with my interference and said if she must not have the moss rose she would have none She swung her bonnet in anger as we left the spot and when I cautioned her as to the mischief she might do she repeated the action with more violence and bade me trouble my head with my own affairs for the rose tree was not mine At that moment the dinner bell rang a second time and as we o were the two last in the garden I was obliged to hurry indoors without CD J ascertaining if she had really hurt any of the flowers We walked into town in the evening therefore we must be certain no one has been here in the mean time The fact spoke for itself and if a doubt had remained the sullen and guilty countenance of the mischievous girl told sufficient to remove it Censure was unanimous but the kind hearted Lucy unwilling to mortify her more than was necessary ex pressed her belief that she was not aware of the consequences when she gave way to her temper the day before Julia caught at this leniency and answered pertly To be sure she was not I would not give much for your regret said the little Mary if you speak in that sharp way 1 This was a new offence to the pet fish girl and she withdrew from the circle in great anger Miss Saville followed and tried to soften her but she would not listen to any advice and fixed herself against the trunk of a walnut tree in obstinate inactivity The spot was near the tulip bed so that our butterflies had full opportunity of observing her con duct The rest of her companions had joined in play at a distance and thither the winged friends would willingly have followed to view their innocent sports but they dreaded ex posing themselves while Julia was in sight her disposition had sufficiently evinced her capability of hurting them if in her power and they therefore carefully avoided the dan ger by keeping close in their hiding place where they had full opportunity of watching her actions Children are not always sensible of the disgust they create when under the influence of malignant passions Here was a fine and clever little girl exciting the contempt of two insignificant butterflies instead of sharing the amusements and regards of hey schoolfellows her feet which should have been employed in a healthful race were shuffling on the gravel to the detriment of a pair of new kid shoes while her lingers were pluck ing and destroying every leaf within her reach many times her eye turned to the rose tree but fears prevented revenge The tulip prisoners longed for her departure and sincerely rejoiced when the breakfast bell summoned the children to their first meal at this moment Julia made a snatch at some thing and kept it fast in her hands Miss Simpson observed her as they all returned down the great avenue and exclaimed she hoped Julia had not spoiled another rose She made no answer but placed her hand behind her O she has for certain cried Mary I wonder she is not ashamed to go indoors and meet my govern ness Is this the rose said Julia bringing forward and opening her hand All pressed forward to look It was not a flower but a butterfly crushed to death A look of pity passed from one to another and they retreated from the cruel girl as though her company were contagious Shame on yon unfeeling child said Miss Saville be assured your conduct will meet punishment nor shall I endeavour to screen you for you well merit it Saying this she withdrew and the young criminal slowly followed despised and shun ned by all The sympathising breasts of our two friends longed to afford assistance to their poor fellow creature if indeed he still existed and as soon as the children were out of sight they repaired to the spot but alas their humanity was unavailing life was extinct As they bent over him with sad regret a sudden exclamation from his companion startled the Peacock and he enquired the cause Behold cried the other behold in this unhappy victim of human passions my valued friend Shamrock 5 c Is it possible But too true indeed I perceived the likeness the first moment 1 looked at the bod and a close inspection places the fact beyond doubt How I lament we did not meet before he fell into the hands of that cruel girl how much entertainment and instruction have we not missed by hi unexpected demise This is another proof of the uncertainty of butterfly happiness I tremble my dear Peacock lest our separation be near at hand and perhaps from a similar fate Say not so returned the other you make me shudder at the bare idea of such a thing I believe I never possessed great fortitude and am assured should such a fate be in store for one and I the survivor I should prove a bad philosopher J Pray gentlemen said a brisk young butterfly whose white wings seemed to float in the air have you met in the course of your morning rambles one of us with scarlet wings spotted here and there in a curious manner though not so handsome as that gentlemans meaning our hero Now it may be remembered Pea cock had no partiality for ladies of the white robe he remembered the flirtation of one and doubted the sincerity of this his vanity was not so alert as heretofore and the compliment to his beauty produced no gratification His sage friend took upon himself to answer seeing his reluctance to notice the lady I cannot say ma dam that we have noticed a butterfly answering your description Dear me it is very strange re turned she he is a particular friend of mine and promised to meet me this morning to conduct me to a gar den not very far from this where I am to join a large party at a sweet pea feast I am but a novice in travelling and so fearful of children that I tremble at the sight of one and just now I stumbled on half a hundred in these very grounds I really thought I should have fainted j however I escaped unperceived by any of them I am happy to say answered our Peacock that your fears were groundless for excepting one child the rest were too amiable to hurt a worm 1 wish it were more often the case observed the stranger for really I have heard terrible accounts of them 5 e Ah my dear Lily cried a scar let winged butterfly approaching the trio I have been looking for you these live minutes past And I have been waiting for you replied she it is past the time appointed I began to fancy some mis hap had befallen you or that you had changed the route and was en quiring of the good strangers if they had seen one of your kind Well I am here at last and ready to attend you to our party who anxiously look for your presence Perchance these gentlemen will be gracious enough to join us and share the delights of a pea feast I will ensure them plenty and a welcome Our friends at first refused but Scarlet was pressing and Lily was engaging so between both they gained their point and after a pleasant flight they descended to a bed of sweet peas whose beautiful tints and delightful fragrance might have tempted any butterfly in the universe it may be that Brown and yellow experienced a slight return of former epicurisms for his spirits exhilarated as he viewed the luxurious scene They were received with every mark of respect by the gay party assembled Our heros rank and beauty entitled him to attention and not withstanding the inferiority of his companions appearance they imagined he must he somebody by sharing his friendship and they perceived he treated Brown and yellow with regard and deference Good humour was the order of the day they met for enjoyment and all appeared satisfied Lily was a great favourite with her friends and could lead them to what she liked she proposed a short excursion after the repast which was readily agreed to and she spread her white wings as guide they followed and entered a delightful greenhouse it was the first our hero had ever seen internally and excited his warmest admiration the warbling of birds in an adjoining aviary added to his pleasure and he proposed to his friend their taking up their residence in the charming place I admire its beauties equally with yourself answered he but should be sorry lo decide on your plan no no it is too near the habitation of man I should never feel secure a moment it is very well to visit such a place occasionally but I have no desire to make it my home You are right no doubt re turned Peacock I spoke at random you always reflect ere you utter 3our sentiments Lily now advanced and informed them that she had discovered a most elegant apartment at the extremity of the greenhouse decorated with shrubs orange trees and in short every thing they could fancy as beautiful and added there were two ladies in the room one shewing the other some curious stuffed birds in glass cases I dont like the last part of your account said Brown and yellow I ieai she is a virtuoso 1 What a female virtuoso Yes Miss Lily no uncommon thing I assure you Her fancy may not stop at birds and I should regret to see any of my fair companions fall a sacrifice to her good taste and discernment But she is such a sweet looking her dress is so elegant and every thing looks so enticing around her That you would have us fall into the snare to admire the bait that caught us I speak disinterestedly for my class is not one to claim her notice it is more than probable I am safe but ye young and lovely would for certain meet danger and I dare not let my dear friend encounter the c While I can possibly prevent it Several agreed with the last speaker but more with Lily who whispered our hero that his friend was jealous of their superior charms and because he could not shew himself off to ad vantage wished to keep them all in the background Our butterfly had too much sense to attribute such motives to his friends but example is a dangerous thing he could not divest himself of Lilys wish and at length openly espoused the same side of the question It was at last decided that six of the party should visit the charming apartment and after satisfying their curiosity return and despatch the others on the same errand Lily had gained an influence over our peacock of which he was not conscious and although it was arranged he should not be one of the first party she soon persuaded him to and against the advice of brown and yellow he actually set forth on the hazardous expedition Mis friend however followed at a distance in the hope that should he perceive danger approaching he might Induce his volatile favourite to return Lily had not said too much of the scene they were to witness the apartment was indeed elegant and the ladies did honor to the apartment they were yet looking at the birds Weil said one of the fair exa miners I am infinitely obliged to you for this exhibition I have seen many birds preserved in a similar way but never such beautiful ones it is really quite a treat Have you any insects or shells and fossils Some few of the latter but I think there is much cruelty in collect ing insects as 1 know they are generally killed for the purpose and for this reason I never wish them to adorn mv cabinet I told you there was no danger whispered Lily did you ever hear sweeter tones of humanity You are very tenderhearted said the other lady smiling it really never entered my head I have been so accustomed to view them in all stages and I certainly do admire them butterflies for instance Here our travellers halted and listened eagerly for the remainder of her speech She continued Butterflies for instance what can be more beautiful My father has some in his collection that are quite wonderful I know he has but can never re concile myself to such things I declare when I go to Mr Siiakeheads Museum I never enjoy the scene for reflecting on the means he 1ms adopted to procure many of the harmless creatures before me Charmed as our party were with the sentiments of the last speaker they did not feel quite at ease in the presence of her companion Per haps said one she maybe in the habit of collecting insects and killing them for her father I am frightened out of my wits lest she should disco ver us Never fear answered Lily her friend will protect us in my mind we are safer here than any where I have a great desire to see these birds and shall venture to the table assured our fair advocate will not suffer harm to befal me It was in vain the rest opposed this bold intention Lily was a positive butterfly and made her way to the table as she said A sudden and violent storm of thunder and rain startled the two who quitted their employment The tenderhearted one let the case fall suddenly from her hands the fate of Lily was decided its weight crushed her to atoms as she was creeping on the table beneath The act was perfectly unintentional and the perpetrator remained ignorant of the death she had occasioned Not so the horrorstruck party of her own species who had gathered in a circle to witness her Quixotism and consequently all beheld her melancholy end Our hero felt particularly affected and hastened from the lately admired spot as fast as possible He felt ashamed on perceiving Brown and yellow closely watching him You know all that has passed of course said he I do indeed returned his friend and much as I lament the fate of our pretty Lily am thankful for your escape this is no place for us let us return to the greenhouse thank the good folk for their hospitalitv and again seek the regions of air freedom is every thing to us who are Natures children in future we will content ourselves with her simple produce enjoy it in its natural state and not hazard this constant peril by seek ing more refined food Peacock had nothing to offer in contradiction to these truths and readily agreed to quit the greenhouse as soon as the forms of civility were over Their intention was no doubt prudent but the plan was far more easily concerted than executed for during their absence the windows of the greenhouse had been closed by the careful gardener when the storm commenced and as it yet continued the whole party were detained prisoners There did not appear much danger m the situation but Lilys catastrophe had a material effect on their spirits and all seemed anxious to be off It should seem that patience is a desirable quality even in a butterfly for in the present case no other remedy was at hand While flying from shrub to shrub anxiously awaiting the reopening of the windows Peacock discovered an opening in one of the sashes sufficiently wide to allow of escape With joy he communicated the same but to his great surprise many pre ferred remaining until the storm was over A few were wiser and with Brown and yellow availed them selves of what they deemed good fortune On regaining their liberty our friends took a grateful leave of their new acquaintance and directed their flight towards the garden of Mrs Bed ford where they hoped to enjoy u quiet repose for they flattered them selves Miss Julia would be very cautious in showing her ill temper hi future Unfortunately they had not a just idea of the distance and sup posed themselves near their former residence when they were wide from it Peacock observed a garden wall Of which looked very like Mrs Bedfords and they quickly descended on the other side It was not the spot expected but there was a similarity in the laying out the flowerbeds and they concluded it was a different part of the same grounds and they doubted not by perseverance arriving at the tulip bed The farther they went however the more they found themselves astray and despairing of gaining the desired haven they were beginning to consider if it were wise to take up their abode in this new place when a hubbub of many loud voices made them start with surprise and in a few seconds the green lawn before them vas covered by a number of boys buoyant with youth and spirits They now no longer doubted their mistake and guessing that a boys seminary was no place of security for butter flies they again took their departure as speedily as possible Wishing to avoid the public road they turned into a long narrow lane shaded by trees afford ing a delight ful shelter and leaving them at liberty to enjoy a little private conversation How much I regret said Brown wings our foolish acceptation of the strangers invitation we have lost our quiet and pleasant home have suffered much unnecessary anxiety and witnessed the melancholy death of a lovely female who perhaps in her wish to entertain us hastened her own fate Alas I fear so returned the other but my share of blame is far greater than yours for had I resisted poor Lilys proposal she might have desisted in compliment to us as strangers Well it is now too late to repair the error observed Brown wings we must he more cautious in time to come I only wish we could find our old haunt I felt attached to it and am persuaded the amiable pupils of Mrs Bedford would never have molested our sports But see what have we here look through this gap there is a fine house and spacious grounds what a beautiful border of flowers round that lawn it is quite tempting But I fear it is too public we will just take a survey of the place and pursue our journey for retirement is now our first and most desirable object True answered Peacock but methinks we could meet no harm in taking a nearer view of this fair scene His friend thought so too and they accordingly went through the opening over a low paling and approached the enticing flower border The house at some distance was a magnificent ancient structure and they guessed belonged to some nobleman of high rank a fine park lay to the right in short the whole formed a spacious demesne which they admired some time unmolested At length they heard approaching steps and shortly beheld a female servant with a young child it was just learning to walk and looked so pretty and innocent that our butterflies rested on a briar to watch its interesting motion The nurse was not one of those careful attendants who may be trusted with their charge out of sight of the pa rent in fact she was any thing but Hannah Bennett Holding the babe carelessly by the arm she let it slip and the helpless little creature fell on its face on the gravel walk As may be supposed loud cries followed the blow and Mrs Nurse used all her powers of coaxing to quiet the young lord as she called him but he was not so easily pacified and the woman appeared frightened lest his shrieks should reach the house She picked flower after flower which he threw from him indignantly Nurse was more alarmed At length her eye caught the two spectators of the scene when forgetting every thing but her young masters cries she grasped Brown and yellow who was nearer than our hero and holding him up by the wing cried See see my sweet darling here is a pretty creature a nice fine butterfly all for my own child shall nurse beat the naughty thing for making dear Lord Charles fall and hurt his pretty face Lord Charles now held his tongue for a moment and stretched out his chubby hands for the naughty butter fly but no sooner was it in his power than the unconscious babe tore the unfortunate insect into a dozen pieces Gentle readers imagine the feelings of our hero while beholding the horrible transaction Grief indignation despair each took possession of his breast in a paroxysm of wretchedness he flew over the bush and lighted at the feet of the unfeeling woman in the hope she would seize him as a second sacrifice but whether she overlooked him or the sound of voices now induced her flight we know not but suddenly snatching up the child she hurried clown a serpentine walk and soon disappeared Sincere and bitter were the lamentations our solitary wanderer poured forth over the mangled relics of his disinterested friend Never never more cried he shall I meet with such a true friend in thee I have lost all that made life desirable no longer will I shun the haunts of man I will present myself to his view at all times and seek the death I have hitherto avoided Accident I may es cape but the cruelty of human nature is certain We are all apt to forget past good when evil presents itself just so with our brokenhearted butterfly in his grief for this heavy loss he forgot the humanity of the gentle Phebe and Ned the kindness of Lucy Saville and the feeling of Lilys unconscious destroyer It must be allowed his conduct v as censurable but if we feel that intellectual beings are capable of the same we may assuredly be lenient to a despairing insect Scarcely knowing how he flew he approached the house and entered the first open window He saw a male and female but he did not as heretofore shun them the gentleman was reading and the lady lolling on a sofa half asleep A moments view of the latter discovered to him the fair virtuoso who acknowledged her admiration of dead butterflies to her friend in the greenhouse apartment A moment before he had desired death now he shrank from the chance of his wish being realized yet like the moth and the candle he hovered round the flame wanting power or resolution to escape The indolence of the lady prevented her rising to look about her but his terror was not abated by her inactivity for he guessed the sour countenanced gentleman reading was no other than her father whose collection she had so praised In truth he was right the noble lord was no other than the celebrated Earl of Mothhead whom our readers may remember was mentioned by the old virtuoso to Nathaniel Lap wing Suddenly laying down the book he exclaimed Lady Amelia secure at beautiful butterfly at your left elbow he is worth preserving Her ladyship endeavoured to do as desired but our nimble hero avoid ed her slender fingers and flew to the opposite side of the room The earl jumped up his daughter did the same and a complete ehace ensued during which the persecuted insect received many severe contusions though eventually he escaped the snare and made his way into the grounds by another window But freedom was all he gained his sufferings were acute and strength seemed fast decaying With much difficulty he reached the opposite side of the lawn and crawling up the low walk descended into the lane from which he first entered How unlike his entrance was the departure Alone in pain of mind as well as body it seemed of little consequence where he went next but all sense left him was horror of the earl and his grand estate and he fancied if he could once lose sight of it he should die content A long time elapsed before he did so for lite was fast vrasth Who shall speak his joy when turning the corner of the green lane he beheld the humble cottage the home of his earliest favourites Yes the much regretted spot was now be fore him his native jasmine source of his happiest meals The sight renovated his drooping spirits he flew to the open casement saw the rosy features of Phebe resting on her brothers shoulder crept to the nearest branch of jasmine dropped on one of its fairest blossoms and DIED SO ENDS THE RAMBLES OF A BUTTERFLY
