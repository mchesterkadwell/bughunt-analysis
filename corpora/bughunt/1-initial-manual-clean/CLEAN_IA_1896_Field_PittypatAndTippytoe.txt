He's that old fellow In front of Miss Yellow, 

With his mouth full— running away. 




The boldest feeds fronn Alice's hand, 
As she sits on the porch at rest; 

While down in the shade is the little maid. 
With the chicken she loves the best. 



APTAIN Fido, Terrier Skye 

Wears an eyeglass in his eye, 
Pair of gloves and fine cravat, 

Walking stick and new silk hat 

Captain Fido Terrier Skye 
Was a soldier, days gone 
by; 

Everybody knows him 

well- 
He's a military swell. 

You can see him every day, 
Stiff and martial, stern and 
gray. 

As he strolls across the 
Park 

To his club, the "Bone and 
Bark." 






wo Chickies were out one day taking the 
air. 

Said One "well I never!" said Two 
"i declare," 
For there fronn his egg-shell peeped Chick 

number Three, 
His beak and two bright eyes were all they 
could see: 

"Peep, peep," said the Chick "please excuse me this 
morn, 

If I talk very little— I'm only just born!" 





IDE a Cock-horse 
To Banbury Cross, 
To see an old 
woman . 
Ride upon a white 
horse; 
Rings on her fingers 
And bells on her 
toes, 
She shall have 
music 
Wherever she 
goes. 





Sometimes there are griefs to soothe, 
Sometimes ruffled brows to smooth; 
For (I much regret to say) 
Tippytoe and Pittypat 

Sometimes interrupt their play 

With an internecine spat, 
Fie, for shame, to quarrel so— 
Pittypat and Tippytoe! 



Oh, the thousand worrying things 
Every day recurrent brings! 
!Hands to scrub and hair to brush, 

Search for playthings gone amiss, 
IVIany a wee complaint to hush, 

IVlany a little bump to kiss; 
Life seems one vain fleeting show 
To Pittypat and Tippytoe! 








LL day long they come and go— 
Pittypat and Tippytoe; 
Footprints up and down the hall, 
Pigythings scattered on the floor, 
&lt; Fingermarks along the wall. 

Tell-tale smudges on the door— 
By these presents you shall know 
Pittypat and Tippytoe. 



How they riot at their play! 

And a dozen times a day 

In they troop, demanding bread- 
Only buttered bread will do. 

And that butter must be spread 
Inches thick with sugar, tool 

And I never can say, "No, 

Pittypat and" Tippytoe!" 





Then Chick number One said to Chick 
number Two, 
It's certainly plain, there's but one thing to do; 
He'll catch cold if he stays out here 

long, I'm afraid"— 
So with two bits of stick a Sedan Cha 

they made. 
One, Two, Three and away, 

and without any harm 
They carried that little Chick 
home to the Farm. 




CiRANDMUiU£K AND I. 




fRANDMA told me all about it, 
Told me so I couldn't doubt it; 
How she danced— my grandma danced- 
Long ago. 

How she held her pretty head, 
How her dainty skirt she spread, 
How she turned her little toes- 
Smiling little human rose I— 
Long ago. 



Grandma's hair was bright and sunny, 
Dimpled cheeks, too— ah, how funny! 
.... Really quite a pretty girl, 
Long ago. 

Bless her! why she wears a cap. 
Grandma does, and takes a nap 
Every single day; and yet 
Grandma danped the minuet 
Long ago. 




OMCATSKI'S the place 
For ribbons and lace. 

And gloves that are handsonne and 
gay J 

"We have very fine mittens 
For ladylike kittens, 

And this is our bargain day." 



ERE'S Madam Black, and Madam White, 

And Madam Brown, as well, 

With old Sir Dorking, who's been out 
walking 

With Speckle, the farm-yard belle. 

Here's Chicken Little, old Hen Pen, 
And Lord Chanticleer, so gay — 




OUNG Whiskers 

And pretty Miss Bunnikin Sweet, 
Are admiring the view 
To 'be seen from this seat; 



And the view is so fine, 

And the seat is so small, 
He's put his arm round her 
For fear she might fall. 





But Bunnikin's Mistress 

Approaches the pair. 
And is too shocked for utterance 

At what she sees there; 



In less than a minute 
She picks up her pet, 

And leaves Young 

Mr. Whiskers 
To scold and to fret. 




FUNNY old fellow, so I've heard say, 
Comes along at the close of day, 
With a shadowy cloak about him flung. 
And a big, big bag on his shoulders hung. 

0, you with gray eyes, or brown eyes, or blue, 
What do you think he comes to do? 
Why to sprinkle sand on your eyelids white, 
Whenever it's time to say good-night. 

Till the little eyes so heavy grow, 

That they droop and close tight, if you must 
know; 

So with hislriantle wrapped around you fast, 

He carries you off to dream-land at last. 



Two tearful maidens; 

Hearts full of woe. 
Which of them did it? 

I really don't know. 



HAT can I serve you with ? 
Sugar or spice ? 
Our tea, Ma'am, is thought to be 
Fragrant and nice. 

Not tea and not coffee? 

All bones, Ma'am, you say I 
No, they sell those at Brisket's, 
Just over the way. 





; HE was a chick and he was a fish, 
And he took her out to ride; 
But she hated the waves with their swirl 
and swish. 
And she clung to his neck and cried— 
"I'm frightened dear 

fish, and I almost ^ 
wish 
You'd let me 
ride inside." 




HEN Tommy Purr came back to school, 
he gave a lovely spread, 
There'd never been so fine a feast, so 

. every scholar said. 
They'd jugs of cream, and bags of 
sweets, and pots of home-made jam. 



A currant cake, sonne biscuits, and 

some candy and some ham I 
And some were sitting on their beds, 

and others on the floor, 



^ Just a mouse inside 

the wall; 
But they finished up that spread. 
Every Puss tucked up in bed; 
Then gave a quiet hip-hooray for Tommy and 
his hamper! 



When in the middle Whiskers heard a step 




outside the door! 
''The Teacher's coming I " 
—into bed you should 



have seen them 



scamper. 



Twas a false alarm, 
thats all, 



HEN Lazy Sam went to market, 

He tried on old Neddy to ride; 
If he'd gone on two legs, 
He'd have saved ail his eggs 

And brought home his money be- 





A JAPANESE GIRL AND HER DOLL I 


SUPPOSE my hair looks funny 
To little girls like you ; 
Perhaps nr&gt;y dolly, too, looks funny — 
Her name is Chin-ka-Chu. 

Won't you come, some day, to see me 

It's an easy thing to do. 
You II like my ''tea-chest" do'ly, 

!f her name is Chin-ka-Chu. 



GOOSE, an owl and a little brown hen 

Were taking a walk one day, 

When they met a brown bear, who had 
not combed his hair, 

And a mule who was hauling a dray. 

"Oh, kind Mr. Mule! Oh, good Mr. Mule! 

Oh, nice Mr, Mule!'' cried the hen, 

"We're so glad to have met you, we'll 
never forget you j 

you take us to see Mrs. Wren?" 



Then said Mr. Bear, "It would scarcely 
be fair 

To take my best carriage away, 

For I really must go to the fair, don't you 
know. 

And I haven't a moment to stay," 

So the hen and the goose and the owl 
turned around 

And made Bruin a very low bow; 

Their hearts nearly broke, yet none of them 
spoke, 

And I think they Ve standing there now. 





ERE stands Mother Tree, 

With arms so high ; 

Well she knows Mr. 
Wind 

Will soon pass by. 

So her little seed babies, 

"As still as a 
nnouse," 

Are tucked in a hard, 
dry 

Shell of a house. 



Mr. Wind passes by 

And he shakes the 
tree; ^ 

Down- they conne, fall- 
ing, 

One, two, three; 

And rolling and laugh- 
ing 

They fall on the 
ground, 

'Till there's nn ill ions of 
nuts 

Lying all around. 





HE big and the little and middle-sized Bear, 
They put the bear's grease thick on 
their hair, 

They washed their faces— each of the 

three— v 
And then they went to the Lion's to tea. 

The Tiger was there, and the Kangaroo, 
The Elephant brought some Snakes he 
knew. 

And the Panther came with the big 
Baboon, 

And they danced all night by the light 
of the moon. 




E'RE spending the day 
In the pleasantest way, 

With Uncle Eliphalet Brown. 
We can run at our ease, 
Or do just v/hat we piease, 

And we never can do that in town 



So Jack "brought his 
toys, ' 

:i,vj ijuolest of boys, |xS^ 

And is making af'^-x) 
fort as you see. 

Soon it will be done, 
With fort/i soldier and gun; 

WeVe as happy as happy 
can be. 




But, alas for our fun, 
See what Carlo has done! 

The wretched dog nnade but one bound, 
And the fort that Jack made, 
With his pail and his spade. 

Was tunnbled about on the ground. 



I think we will go 

To the house just 
below, 

For dolly' has 
had a bad 
sprain ; 

See Jack nnilk the 
I cow — 

Though he doesn't know 
how — 

And go honne on the six 
o'clock train. 





OW I'm cross," crowed Sir Speckles 
Do you think it . 



is right 
For hens to be 
out 

At this tinne o' 

night? 
Come straight 
up to roost, 
This minute, I say, 
You have everyone 

clucked 
Quite enough for 
to-day I " 



E SEEMS to be several boys in one, 

So n^ch is lie constantly everywhere! 
And the mischievous things that boy has 
done 

No mind can remember nor mouth 
declare, 

He fills the whole of his share of space 
With his strong, straight form and his 
merry face, 

The world is needing his strength and 
skill; 

He will make hearts happy, or make 
them ache. 

What power is in him for good or ill! 
Which of life's paths will his swift 
feet take? 

Will he rise and draw others up with 
him — 

Or the light-that is in him burn low 
and dim? 

But what is my neighbor's boy to me 
M/ore than a nuisance? My neigh- 
bor's boy, 

Though I have some fear for what he 
may be, 

Is a source of solicitude, hope and 
' joy, 

And a constant pleasure; because I pray 
That the best that is in him will rule 
some day. 




ARLO went out to spend the day, 
So Monsieur Chanticleer, 
Kept house for him, and 

that is why 
You see hinn perching here. 





THE BUTTON CHARM. — A SAD FATJi. 



O market, to market, 

He went with all speed. 
To buy him some carrots. 
His bunnies to feed ; 

Then home again, home again. 

Gallop and trot, 
And the hungry wee bunnies 
A fine dinner got ! 





HERE are some silly little girls 

Who don't know winat to do, 
Wl-ien tiney attennpt to speak a piece 
YouVe seen.thenn, haven't you? 



But if I chance to do real well, 
My parents dear will, say 

That I have tried to please them — 
So I'll do my best to-day. 




Coat as sleek as a dandy's clothes, 
Proud is Dick of his taper nose. 
Here he is — there he is; don't you see 
What a busy dog is he? 



UCH a happy band are we 
As we march, march away! 
m&gt; We've all learned our lessons, so 
We've all earned our play! 



We often take a tramp 

Just as you see us now, 
For we all are fine musibianSj 

Even Toss can sing "bow-wow!" 




LL the birds and bees are singing, 
All the lily bells are ringing, 
All the brooks are full of laughtf / 
And the winds conne whispering after 
What is I't the flowers say? 
It is lovely May! 
The flowers say it's lovely May; 
Lovely, loveJy May. 





ANDLUON, dandeiio, your heart of gold, 
Don't you know it's April weather, blowing 
rude and cold? 

Why not wait until sweet May comes with 
her smiling grace? I 

That's the time for you to show your downy, 
yellow face. 



TERRIBLE boy was mischievous Dick, , 
Ripe for all manner of meddlesome trick; | 
leasing His sisters and breaking their toys, 
Annoying his elders by making a noise, ' 
Apparently thinking it very great fun \ 
To be thought a nuisance 'by every -one ] 






OOD-BYE, my little one, good-bye. 
The night has conne, the dustnnan's nigh ; 
Each little bird has gone to bed, 
And 'neath his wing has tucked his 
head. 

Good night, nhy sweet, nnay Angels keep 
Watch above you while you sleep. 



NCE on a time/' said Mama, 

"There were two little curly heads — 
Both of them tired and sleepy — 

They should be in their little beds." 



"We're busy, mother dear" 

The little pussies said, 

"Making a cat's cradle 

For Baby Pussy's bed." 

"If you had been good kittens 

I was going to take you down 

To see the great Regatta 

At Periwink e town " 

"Your cousin Tom will be there 

And the Cats' Own Minstrel Band— 
Their music is just splendid. 

The best in Tabbyland." 

"You say you will be good I' 

Well then, put on your things 

We'll hurry off and catch the train, 
Come on, both Tib and Jings 



THE YOUNG ARTIST 


0 Blackberry Farrr. the little folks went, 
And O, What a beautiful day they spent, ^ 
The little pigssaid-"Wee, wee, wee, wee 

And the ducks thought the farmyard pond 

was the sea. 
The turkeys gobbled, the horses neighed 
And Tray barked a welcome, while Neddv 

brayed. 

The geese and the chickens and all the rest 
Oh, the puzzle was which thing they l.ked 
the best. 




Little Marjory liked the cows tiiat said "Moo," 

And tine doves and the pigeons that sang "Coo-Coo;" 
But Baby said, with a sweet little smile, 

That she loved the pony they saw by the stile 



Dolly liked best the chickens so fluffy and wee, 

And the kittens so young that they couldn't yet see; 
"Tis a beautiful place," said Baby small, 
"And they're all so lovely I like them all." 



LASS and silver, plates and knives, 
Cups and saucers, too; 
Pans and kettles— big and little- 
Plenty here to do. 


Here comes Kitty with her apron. 

Listen ! You can hear her say-
Let me help you v^ith them, Mama;
That's our blue-eyed Kitty's way. 


wo pinky feet, wee chubby toes, 
A mouth as sweet as any rose; 
Fat, d inn pled cheek, twin eyes of gray, 
That seem to speak in helpless way. 

Without the power to tell its need. 
Which every hour true love must heed; 
Mid smiles and tears and many a mood 
So pass the years of babyhood. 





E: ONG days of sun; short nights of grief; 
No fear of woes beyond relief. 
In homes of wealth or poorest cot 
Life's childhood seems a happy lot 



For thoughl is rapt 
in present things) 

Centered on all that 
each day brings. 

A bright spring life 
at school and play, 

So passes by glad 
childhood's day. 





HE little French doll was a dear little doll 
Tricked out in the sweetest of dresses ; 
Her eyes were of hue 
A most delicate blue, 



And dark as the night were her tresses. 
Her dear little nnouth was fluted and red 
Ifl^^And this little French doll was 
so very well bred 
That whenever accosted her 
little mouth said: 
"Mamma! Mamma!" 

The stockinet doll, with one arm and 
one leg, 

Had once been a handsome young 
fellow, 

But now he appeared 

Rather frowzy and bleared 
m his torn regimentals of yellow. 




Yet his heart gave a curious thump as he lay 
In the little toy cart near the window one day 
And heard the sweet voice of that French dolly say: 

"Mammal Mammal" 

He listened so long and he listened 
so hard 

That anon he grew ever so tender, 
For its everywhere 

known 
That the feminine 
tone 

Gets away with all 

masculine gender. 
He up and he wooed her with soldierly zest 
But all she'd reply to the love he professed 
Were these plaintive words, which 

perhaps you have 
guessed; 
"Mamma! 

Mammal" 







Hep mother-a sweet little lady of five- 
Vouchsafed her parental protection. 
And although Stockinet 
Wasn't blueblooded yet 
She really could make no objection. 
So soldier and dolly were wedded 
one day 

And a moment ago, as I journeyed 
that way, 

I'm sure that I heard a wee baby voice 
say: 

"Mamma! Mamma!" 



— EucewE Field. 




ADING brooks and climbing trees, 
All day long to do as you please, — 
Nothing to do but to run and play; 
Isn't this. a fine washing day? 





N Sleepy Town 
They think a night-cap worth a crown, 
And there the law commandeth peace, 
And all good people take their ease; 
A wise old owl, big-eyed and brown, 
He is lord mayor of sleepy town. 

In Sleepy Town 
The wheels are shod with eider- 
down 

The pavements all are silk and wool; 

The quiet there is 

beautiful; 
A bumble-bee in 
gold-black 
gown 
The beadle is in 
Sleepy Town. 




In Sleepy Town 
Black shadows never fall or frown, 

Nor do they feel the sunshine's glare, 
But gentle twilight reigneth there, 

While poppy scents blow up and down 
The gardens fair in Sleepy Town. 

In Sleepy Town 
We'll mount a cloud of vapor brown, 

We'll close our eyes and fold our hands 

And call a wind from distant lands; 
O'er valley's and mountain's crown 
We'll float away to Sleepy Town. 




ED and purple morning glories, 

Lightly swaying in the breeze, 


You seenn filled with fairy stories; 

Won't you tell thenn to me, please? 

Little maid, we have no stories. 
True or fairy, new or old; 

WeVe but iaughmg morning glories 
For your pretty hands to hold. 




Y little child comes to my knee, 

And tugging pleads that he may 
climb 

Into my lap to hear me tell 

The Christmas tale beloved so 
^ ^ 

well— 

A tale my mother told me 
Beginning "Once upon a time." 

It is a tale of skies that rang 

With angel rhapsodies sublime; 
^ Of that great host, serene and white, 

The shepherds saw one winter night— 
And the glorious stars that sang 

An anthem once upon a time. 



This story of the hallowed years 
Tells of the sacrifice sublime 

Of One who prayed alone and wept 
While His wearied followers slept— 

And how his blood and Mary's tears 
Commingled once upon a time 



And now my darling at my side, 
And echoes of the distant chime, 
Brmg that sweet story back to me, 
Of Bethlehem and Calvary, 
And of the gentle Christ that died 
For sinners once upon a time. 




The mighty deeds that men have told 
In ponderous tones of fluent rhyme 
Like misty shadows fade away; 

But this sweet story bides for aye; 
And, like the stars that sang of old. 
We sing of "Once upon a time." 





ROUND the window, near her bed, 
All drowsily hang the roses; 
# The haze half veils the evening red, 
And over the moorland closes. 

Too weary is she for task or play, 

She only feels that sleep' is best; 
Since heavenly love with her will stay, 
She fears not in the dark to rest 





N the threshold baby stands, 

Holding out her little hands * 
To the great world just beyond, 
Just beyond the door. 
Ah, that door! It shuts her in 
From the pleasures she would win, 
And within her baby -heart, 

She is saying o'er and o'er 
That some day she'll ope' it wide 
And step forth to see in pride 

That great world she longs to see 
More and more. 



Ah, my baby, in your eyes 

I can see the longing rise 

That I in my heart have seen 
Once before. 

Only this:— To step outside, 

Join the hurrying human tide 

That goes marching daily by 

Just beyond the door. 

May you find it just as grand 

When with them you really charm 

As you think it is, my child. 
Looking o'er. 

May you never wish to be 

Just a little child, to see, 

Not to do; just to gaze with longing eyes 
Just beyond the door. 




LBERT and Teddy— pretty good boys— i 
When tin d of running and nnaking a noise,. 
Would throw themselves down on the^ 
nursery floor, | 
To build a big church with an open door.j 

Now Albert would build it, just as you see,^ 
' But Teddy, the rascal, in greatest glee i 
Would push the blocks over to see them fall. 
So their steeple never grew very tall. \ 







ICK went to the country with his nnother. There 
were no children to play with, but Dick soon 
found something to do. He took a barrel and 
cut four holes in it, then he sawed a broom-handle 
into four pieces and put them in the holes. Next, 
he cut a slit in the side of the barrel, near the top. Into 




this he put two sticks which he fou 
were each three inches wide and six 
together, as you see in the picture. 



nd in the house. These sticks 
inches'long, and he nailed them 
This made him a very good 



horse, but one thing had been forgotten, for whoever saw a horse 
without a tail? One more trip to the house for a feather duster ar.d 
the horse was complete. The clothes line furnished harness and 
reins, and as Dick sat on the plow he was as happy as though he 




was the owner of a real horse and buggy. At supper time D'ck 
unhitched his horse and put him in the barn, not forgetting to pive 
him plenty of hay and to cover him with a blanket. 




TAN LEY was very fond of pie, and apple pies 
were what he particularly enjoy^.d. On baking 
days you could generally find Master Stanley 
in the kitchen watching the making of the 
pies. Fronn the paring of the apples to the 
artistic trimnning of the crust, Stanley was a very 
interested spectator and could tell you how many 
apples were necessary to 
the average sized pie. 
As to the eating of the 
pie, after it emerged from 
the oven — hot, delicately 
brown and tempting — 
Stanley was fully equal 
to it, and was never 
known to refuse a second 
piece. But pies were 
not all that Stanley de- 
lighted in. With his 
velocipede or roller skates 




this five year old namesake of th^ great explorer spent a 
good portion of the day on the snnooth sidewalks of the 
avenue, and take hinn all around he was a bright, hearty, 
chubby little fellow, Now Stanley had a sister, Florence, 
with big eyes and yellow hair. Only three years old was 
this little girl, but she, too, was fond of the kitchen on 
baking days, and of her dolly at all tinnes, Very pleasant, 
too, were the daily ronnps with her papa, and with her 
dancing eyes and bright hair streanning out from under 
her yachtsman's cap, "The Commodore," as she was often 
called, was as pretty/ a picture as you would wish to see. 





LICE, come here," said her sister. 

"Come here and tell me what 
you think of that," pointing as she 
spoke to the partly opened window. 
\A/hy, that is a spider's web," said little Alice, " just 
such as I saw on the grass this morning when I 
went out to pick the roses for you, I wish you 
would tell me how the spiders make such beautiful 
threads and how they fasten them just where they 
wish to. One that I saw this morning reached 
from the edge of the pansy bed to the gravel walk, 
and a little leaf had fallen In it and was swinging 
just as I do in my hammock on the porch." 
"Well," said her sister, " if you really wish to know 
about it, 1 Will tell you how the spiders make the 
threads and fasten them as they wish, Spiders 
have the material of which the threads are made 
in their bodies, and they spin It out, a 
single thread at a time. They can fasten 
it to the grass, or to the 
window, or wherever they 
like, because it Is 'sticky' 




as you say when you put pictures in your ^crap-book with 
mucilage. The spider drops, with his head downward, 
spinning out the thread as he goes, and when he sees the 




place where he wishes to stop, he begins to swing back ; 
and forth until he touches the spot and fastens the other 



end of the thread. Now that he has a rope on which to ; 



travel, he patiently climbs to the top and begins spinning ^ 
threads again. When enough of these are in place, he \ 
crosses back and forth, around and around, making the I 
web thicker in the centre. "But why does he do all this?" ^ 
cried Alice. "So that some fly or other insect may be i 
caught in the web," replied her sister. "That is the way \ 

ice, what a wonderful I 
piece of work a spider s web is and how strong the threads I 
must be to support the spider as he works." 1 




THE RABBITS' HOME 





" fl^^^H H/'said Helen, as she found her little brother 

Frank one day alone in the pantry, "what 
are you doing and how did you get in 
here?" "I found the key," said Frank, "And 
what are you doing?" "Tasting everything I 
can," said her brother. " I have tried all the 
jam and jelly, and I have eaten two biscuits 
and five figs and a piece of cake and sohne 
gingerbread and — " "Oh, you mustn't," cried Helen, 
"What makes you such a naughty boy? You will be sick." 
"No I won't," replied Frank, helping himself to another 
piece of cake, "You certainly will," said Helen, "and what 
a foolish boy you are, when you know you- can have all 
these nice things at your birthday supper to-night. Come 
right away with me." "I'm going to have some mince pie 
first," said Frank. "Quick, here conries mother !" cried his 
sister, and P'rank hurried^ away. It was not long before this 
boy's mother found him very sick and he had to take som^ 
very bitter medicine, and be put to bed while his little 
guests enjoyed the good things at the birthday supper. 




Hl^OSABELLA is Susies 
doil. Santa Glaus 
brouglnt it to her and 



1^ Susie tinougint it -was the nnost 



beautiful lest dolly that ever 
was." One day when 
Rosabella was standing 
all alone on a table, the wind 
blew her down and brol&lt;e her 
head. Brother Tonn stuck the 
pieces together with cement, so 
the break could not be seen. 
Then Fido chewed her arnn 
nearly off, but mannnna sewed it 
up so it would not show when 



she was dressed. She has only one foot and most of her

morning Rosabella was quite well, sitting up as straight as 
any doll could. "Doctor Tom" had forgotten all about her 
and was out playing ball before Susie was dressed and

so many times that she does not look as well as when she 
was new, but she i^ just as good."

Rosabella was sick, Susie gave her gruel 
and catnip-tea and peppermint candy, but 
as she did not get better, called in " Doctor 
Tom." He said it was a very bad case. 
She might have gruel and catnip-tea, but no 
peppermint candy. Susie felt rather glad 




S THERE a girl or boy that does noi like 
candy? Give them a penny and it is hop, 
skip and junnp to the nearest place where 
it can be exchanged for the coveted sweetnneat. 
The boy that I have in mind could not walk very 
well. Something was the matter with one of his 
legs, but the "doctor man," as he called him, had 
told the little fellow that by~and-by he could use 
it as well as the other. Well, this small man would go 
anywhere on his velocipede. When he came to cross 
streets or alleys he would jump off and lift it over the 



gutters, and I am pretty sure that when he had a few 
pennies in that wonderful boy's pocket of his there were 


few of his nnates who could beat him In a race to the 
corner candy store. If you meet him on the street try it 
with him some day. 



OHNNY, come here," cned Ralph to his younger 
brother, "come here and see it snow. We'll 
only have one session at school and we'll ask 
mama to let us invite some . boys and girls 
and have a pop-corn pa.^y." "Won't it be 
gre -! Johnny, "let's go and find her 

now. " iViama's permission was easily obtained 
and it was a merry party that gathered in the 
library around the splendid wood fire that the children 
/ere never'tired of watching. All hands helped .shell the 
corn,, h - ns Ralph was the oldest, to him was intrusted 
the respon.siule position of shaking the corn-popper over 
the bright coals. ' Pop, pop, popJ how fast the little hard 
kernels burst their yellow and rea jackets at the funny 
.tories ino fire was telling them, Pnn. pop, pop! "Quick 
Bessie, with the pan!" "Isn't it tunl' "Who's got the 
corn?" " We'll soon have enough to begin on "—and soon 
The big: pan, heaping full, was placed on the table and all 
gathered around it, not forgetting baby Nell, who with 
Sir Thomas, the cat, had been as much interested as any- 
one. Just how much pop-corn six little people could eat I 
don't know, but you may ' sure there was very little left 
by supper time, 



HI LIP was the name of the boy, Mattie 
was the name of the nurse girl, and Mr. 
O'Houlihan drove the watering cart. Now 
this was the way it happened: Philip's 
^ father, mother, brother and Mattie, of course, 

were going away for the hot summer months. 
The trunks were packed and sent down to the 
boat, and Master Philip, dressed all in wh te, was 
put in Mattie's charge. Now this same Philip 
was rather a lively young man and it was not long before 
he contrived to get out of Mattie's sight. He looked up and 
down the village street. No one was in sight but Mr. 
O'Houlihan, his mules and the watering cart, coming slcwly 
towards him. Phil said to himself, "There is no water 
coming out of that cart, and it is a good chance to get a 
ride. I'll do it when it gets past me." Mr. O'Houlihan did 
not notice that the little man had climbed on behind and 





was having an elegant tinne riding on the wet, dusty 
sprinkler, for the day was hot and he was drowsy. Some- 
thing roused hinn however— I wouldn't wonder if one of the 
wheels struck a stone and jolted him a little— anyway he 
started up the mules and pulled the string to let out the 
water. Well, you should have seen that boy! Mattie had 
him home in a few minutes, wet to the skin and as dirty 
as dirt could make him. All his other clothes were in those 
trunks down on the boat, and it was pretty quick work to 
get him and his clothes washed, dried and ironed in time 
to meet his father at the boat, but it was done, and all of 
them enjoyed the sail. 




HERE, my dear," said Santa Claus to his 
wife, "my work for this year is done and 
1 am not sorry." "Did you visit as many 
children as usual," asked the good woman. 
''Children!" cried Santa Claus, "there is no end 
to them. It seems to me that there are more 
of them, every year. If you had not put some 
extra things into the sleigh I should not have 
had enough to go round." Now lots of people never think 
of Mrs. Santa Claus, but if the truth was known she is the 
one that makes sure that the jolly old fellow has plenty of 
good things in his sleigh when he starts, off on Christmas 
Eve. "Where did you leave the reindeer this year?" she 
asked. "Oh, up in Lapland, in the old place. I shall 
ave to get a new sleigh, though; but there will be time 
nnunh to think of that after I take a six months' nap. 
I a,,, ,,uc going to 'i... it^ so long as usual this time, 
you see, tor I must be very particular about 
my list of good and bad boys and girls, and 
it will take some time to get it just right." 

"What is the matter w'th 
the sleigh?" asked Mrs. Santa 
Claus. '*0h, it, got caught 




,n a lot of wires on top of a big house as we were coming 
aiong to-night. These wires in the cities are getting 
dreadfully thick, and I have to be very careful about them. 

They do almost everything by the aid of 
these wires now-a-days, and I wouldn't be 
surprised if I had to use them in my busi- 
ness before many years. 
Well. I m off now for my 
nap. Won't there be lots 
of happy little folks to-morrow morning! And say, if you 
see Jack Frost, ask him to have the weather just right for 
skating and coasting." 





ARJORIE had been promised a Scotch ter- 
rier on her birthday, and you nnay be 
sure she was up bright and early on 



that morning. Just as she had finished dressing 
there was a patter of little feet along the hall,.

blue eyes dance with joy, A very happy tittle 
girl was Marjorie as she ran 
down the stairs to thank her

H, BRIGHT is the sun and fair is the day, 

iV&gt;^ Sweetest bird songs are filling the air, 

While we listen with patience and try real hard 

Not to wish too nnuch for the closing 
prayer. 




We are surely behaving as well as we can, 
And trying to hear all he has to say; 

But how can the preacher nnan talk so long 
On such a beautiful Sunnnner day! 





ah- 
to 

thii iLjb at once ; and 
a p retty state of co n - 
fusion the room was 
''1 in consequence. 
Iliu uiiaiio vvbre all lying about, 
the contents of the dresser draw- 
ers had been emptied out on to 
the floor in seeking a duster, 
the coal-scuttle had been placed 
in 'the centre of the room, tilting 
on the broom-handle, while the 
old cat and her kittens were 
playing hide-and-seek on the 
chairs and about the room. 
"There, now, I must begin to 
clear up," exclaimed poor Polly, 



ALF- PAST ten o'clock, ly i luu I oily, " cina 
I'm not nearly finished, though IV^ been 
working hard all day long." And Polly 
bustled here and there, sweeping the 
steps, dusting, cleaning, rubbing, flying 
rem one thing to another — in fact trying 
half-a-dozen ^ 




in desperation, when her eyes alighted on the cat. "Oh''" 
she cried, "'wont I give it to you !" and she seized the broom- 
handi^ to carry out her intention, when with a crash over 
went the coal-scuttle, and its contents were scattered in 
every direction. This was too nnuch for Polly and she burst 
into tears, exclainning, "That's just my luck; I do nny utmost 
and yet everything seems to go wrong." Rat-tat-tat! 
"Where DID that' knock come from?" cried Polly to herself. 
"Who's there? Come in!" To her surprise and alarm a 
queer little dwarf, about two feet high, apparently rose out 
of the floor and came straight to where Polly stood. "Oh 
dear!" cried Polly, in a dreadful fright, "who 
are you and what 1o you want?" "Child," said 
the dwarf kindly, ' I am King Fairy-Hand, and 
seeing you weeping, I have come to comfort 
you," "Oh, how kind of you," said Polly, "will 
you help me to get the place tidy before mother 
comes in?" " Certainly," said the dwarf, "and 
you and I will sit and look on." Then as he 
called, " Servants of King Fairy-Hand, who delight 
in his command, do your duty, little band!" 
there seemed to spring from the King's hands 
five pairs of tiny dwarfs, about four inches high, 
who at once set to work to clean and tidy the 
room. Polly noticed that they all worked 
together at one thing until it was finished, and 
in a short time the place looked bright and 
cheerful. "Oh, how quickly they work!" she 
cried. "Would you like to have a present of a 
set of my workmen?" said the King. "Yes, 
yes," said Polly. " But they would not obey me." 
" But I say they WILL" replied the King, " if you 




set tu work in the right way/' "Oh, do tell me how," 
cried the excited child, "and I will pronnise to do just as 
you tell nne." " Now," said the King, addressing the dwarfs, 
"just tell this little girl whence you conne and whonn you 
obey." Then the little nnen formed a ring and sang : 

"Ten little men are we, in busy fingers living, 
And we will faithful be, our best work always giviriv^ 
To boys and girls and men, who duty try to do; 
If youVe not lazy then, we'll come with help to you." 

" Polly, child," cried her 
mother gently, " come, it is 
time for bed," and Polly 
awoke with a start to find 
her mother by her side, 
Looking around the room, 
and seeing it in beautiful 
order, she cried, " Haven't 
they done everything nicely, 
mother dear?" "Who?" 
said her mother smiling,"! have done the room." "Then," 
said Polly, "it was only a dream, Oh, Tm so sorry that I 
have been careless and untidy." "Cheer up," said her 
mother, "and tell me about your dream." When Polly had 
finished, her mother said, "Well, child, that is a very funny 
dream; but if you will try in future to set about' your 
work methodically, and do one thing at a time, your dream 
will have a good effect," 



ILDRED had, been reading a story about 
i ; ^.s who had only to say " conne," 
and everything she wished for canne at 
once. It was a hot sunnmer day and as she 
sat under the einn tree thinking over what she 
would wish ' he had the power of the 

princess; ali &gt;r\ce the garden seemed strange 



and ^he heard a voice say 
you will thr&gt;n -| - , ;&gt;-rp.cc

' ' take a rose fronn nne, 

She looked up and saw a 
:ireen pot and on one of the 
who said, "You can have 


anything you wish for except one thing.- If you wish for 
that you lose the rose." "And what is that?" asked Mildred. 
"You nnust never ask for soap bubbles." "Then I will 
no' Tid Mildred, "You will be a princess as long as 



you keep the rose," said the fairy. "Good-bye, I must go 
back to fairy-land." Mildred thought she would try what 
the rose could do, so she thought of a box of toys, and 
said, "Rose, rose, bring to me, everything I wish to see." 
Scarcely had she spoken when she saw on the grass a 
beautiful box of toys. Every day Mildred asked the rose 
for something new and every day more beautiful things- 
came until not only her own room, but the whole house 
was filled with them, Every day she was trying to think 
of something she had not got, and at last she began to 
long for soap bubbles, which were the only things she 
could not have. She could think of nothing else and grew 
quite sad because she could not ask for soap bubbles. 
One day she held up the rose and said to herself, "Shall 
I or shall I not; yes-no, yes-no, yes-soap bubbles. Rose, 
rose, bring to me, everything I wish to see." But no soap 
bubbles came and Mildred grew impatient, shook the rose, 
and again said, "Rose, rose, bring to me, everything I 
wish to see," Then suddenly the air was filled with soap 
bubbles, and one bubble, larger than the rest, closed around 
the golden rose and floated away with it higher, higher, 



higher, until Mildred could no longer see It. She watched 
until it was out of sight, and then she stretched out her 
hands after it, but it was too late. Her rose was gone for- 
ever and the fairies came by moonlight and carried away 
ail the beautiful things that the rose had brought. "What 
a pity," exclaimed Mildred. ''What is a pity?" asl&lt;ed her 
mother. "Why, mother," said Mildred,"! have been asleep 
and. have had such a pretty fairy dream — just as good as 
i story." Then she told her mother all about it. "Very 
pretty indeed," said her mother, "and you may learn a. 
lesson from it People who are always wishing for things 
and can have almost anything they wish for are not really 
happier than others. They are almost always discontented 
with what they possess.
