introduction more than with anything else in the world children are delighted with pictures and picture books pictures are childhoods happiest teachers illustrations are the windows through which the souls of children look at truth at beauty and at life and the apter the illustration the more lasting the lesson which is sure to follow when a book or story is embellished it becomes a friend and a book without pictures is like a flower without sunlight the imagination is quickened by the use of proper pictures and the wee little ones see actually what is on the page in store for them there is the droll story of the fox the turkey and the fence the dancing crocodile and farther on we find the eiirtle pig that got the better of the wolf while dame fidget introduces us to old friends in new facesjack and jill tom thumb and others and as we turn the pages the comical tale of the humane man and the bull calf attracts and merits our attention children understand these things better than we can write them and remember by means of pictures what they would otherwise forget paint a scene and it tells its own story or else the picture becomes a sweet question which nothing but the reading of the narrative can ever fully answer and the bock has a new interest when we have learned the experimental secrets of magic at home or laughed over the adventure of a brummagem bear and a kangaroo we have tried to make queerie queers a book which a child will treasure up and often read a help to the mother and a blessing to every household a charming teacher of merry graceful and delight¬ ful things and a power to brighten every home it enters and we hope not only to please the eye with pictures but to do that which is far better to put within the reach of the little ones an influence for good all powerful because beautiful and beautiful because of the lifegiving truth within it queerie queers is a book filled with the choicest things and parents may feel safe in giving it to their children it is not a mere picture book for the reading will be found even better and more delightful than the pictures to all girls and boys we offer our winsome work for little children in the hope that they will derive from it as much real pleasure as we have had in preparing it for their enjoyment to be a gobblers far from well if a fox turn gobbler too and while you roost without a fear should come and gobble you but to a turkey proud this fate once on a time occurred madam fox managed in her basket snug to jam the bird not that he was so very large the basket was too small and so his feet not number ones couldnt go in at all madam fox was a widow lone and she had brought her son that he might learn by watching her just how the thing was done very painful indeed it is the secret to reveal but madam fox was trying hard to teach her son to steal and sadder still her teaching stuck to him like bricks to mortar and he to stealing turkeys took as young ducks take to water t this night as home they walked in glee she many tales did tell of catching poultry on the sly of perils that befell of angry men with loaded guns of many a barking cur that when she had for chickens gone had sometimes gone for her theyve come so very closethough i tried no offense to give in self respect she said i had to take a fence to live hunting turkeys and other things is fun indeed to do the fun is not so great you see when things come hunting you my mother dear her son replied youre older than you were could you now leap a fourrail fence if chased by an angry cur ah said she im supple yet and reynard do talk sense your ma could not be brought to grief by any fourrail fence youll know if mrs fox was right by reading 11 these rhymes to stupid bird and slyest fox surprises come sometimes my son the dame went on to say a fence may cause mishaps but oh keep eyes and ears alert for dogs and guns and traps remember this when foraging with emphasis she said to use not only your four legs but quite as much your head your fathers legs were long and fleet and few could run so fast but in his head and not his feet he trusted to the last the farmers tried by every lure to stop your fathers breath and yet in spite of all they did he died a natural death to catch your dad a farmer laid a dead duck on the ground in hopes hed take a bite of it in case he should come round of course the duck was poison filled your father stopped to laugh they think he said im not a fox they take me for a calf 41 my oh my sighed mrs fox i would he were with me how his old eyes would sparkle bright this turkey here to see now all this time the turkey lay in terror quite extreme while everything was sadly real twas like a horrid dream if i could have my choice again he said id roost so high that foxes couldnt reach me there unless they learned to fly indeed if i might have the chance it would surprise the people id take as my pet roostingplace the top of a church steeple but now i fear i greatly fear sure as im a sinner madam fox and hungry son will eat me for their dinner justthen a fourrail fence was reached and mrs fox to show that she though anything but young was anything but slow climbed quickly up her balance lost and ere it could be found she basket and the turkey too came tumbling to the ground of course the turkey soon was out and running like a deer he gained on madam fox because she had the fence to clear she had to climb that fourrail fence as quickly as could be so by the time she made a start oh quite a start had hel the pace was swift the turkeys legs were stretched from head to tail and mrs fox kept up pursuit oer field and hill and dale nearer home the turkey came while the anxious moments flew but hungry angry mrs fox was nearer nearer too it seemed at last as if for sure this run for home would fail for mother fox had got so her jaws had seized close his tail but in those jaws the tail was left just like a lock of hair a mighty jerkthe bird was off the fox was standing there the time thus gained was just enough to save the turkeys skin another moment and the bird the farmers yard was in at last upon the chicken house he perched and looked with glee upon old madam fox below as mad as mad could be and now you know i said you would whether in her belief mrs fox was right when she declared no fence could bring her grief youve learned at last she reached a fence and tried too much to do that when she lost her balance there she lost her turkey too what is the moral of this tail im sure i cannot tell for where the gobbler s tail was lost the moral was lost as well children said the maternal bear our family are fond of honey but i wouldnt have you handle a hive not for any amount of money the depths of the woods with no one near we love to eat the luscious comb but then you know all bees object when bears set out to rob their home and when you think theyre far away and you can rest and take your ease upon your track theyre following fast the unrelenting stinging bees and when you stop to lick your paw or say that honeys just the thing theyll swarm around you like a cloud and then will come the awful sting i want you both to try right hard and never once be caught off guard the cubs replied o mother cease your kind advice is all in vain this morning had you said all this you might have saved a world of pain we got the hive no doubt of that and started home so full of glee when all the air grew dark as night beclouded by our enemy on nose and eyes and mouth and ears each special foe did find a place need we say morejust look at us and you will understand the case you might stand there from morn till eve and tell us what we shouldnt do a lookingglass a running stream could tell us that as well as you seeking a home a homeless bear went wandring here went wand ring there to find a house to let he meant and on a tree he found a rent a hole so big tis quite the cheese this lonely bachelor to please did bruin to himself remark my home shall be behind that bark and there as shielded by a charm be free from fear and safe from harm and should a victim pass my way on whom i might dine well some day hell not suspect my presence near until i have him by the ear so in a trice hes in the tree and from the hole sharp watches he but sweetest joys may soon be past and fairest skies be overcast and so it proved was bruins fate upon a hive of bees he sate it almost seemed like justice grim like retribution come to him of all the bears were ever seen the greatest honey thief hed been by him stirred upof course tis plain these bees soon stirred him up again and so because of this disaster through the hole he went much faster faster than hed clambered in poor disappointed angry bruin he ran as hard as he could go and yet his pace was far too slow thousand stings they gave in ire and bruin felt as if on fire pretty black eyes of the little field mouse looked far over tke meadowonejay

stupendous feasts the farmers corn was stacked with care the giant came the field was bare they could not tell that any day he would not come and bear away from out the herd the ox most fine on that

take their precious catch with him twoum take all night were none omitted to tell the crimes that he committed a shame it was upon my soul he never worked he only stole the only thing that was not vile he ever did was fish awhile he had his tackle quite complete and on a rock would take a seat and though elsewhere impatient quite quite patiently would wait a bite the fish that bit he caught them all none were too large and none too small in fact cried he within the sea there is no fish can conquer me that sounded well but there were yet fish in the sea he had not met while catching fish he never thought that by a fish he might be caught one day he felt a terrible tug and gave himself a quiet hug unless my sense of feeling lies this fish is one of monstrous size to get him safe on

should be hard boiled not raw upon the underside of a smooth tray and move the tray round and round horizontally gradually increasing in speed the egg resting in the middle of the tray is carried round and round by the movement and gradually begins to revolve on its own axis faster and faster till at last it is seen to rise on end and spin away exactly as a top would do in all experiments involving eggbalancing you will find it a material aid to success to keep the egg upright in the saucepan while it is being boiled the airchamber will in such case be kept central with the longer axis of the egg which will in consequence be much more easily balanced to set the egg spinning as above described demands a considerable amount of practice not to mention some strength and still more address for the benefit of those who may prefer to succeed at the first attempt i will indicate a simpler plan of proceeding place the tray on the table letting it project so far over the edge as to be readily and rapidly grasped by the hand place the egg in the middle and with the thumb of the left and the first finger of the right hands placed at opposite ends set it vigorously spinning it will imme¬ diately rise on end still spinning quickly seize the tray and you will then have nothing to do but to keep the egg still rotating which is a very easy matter to lift a tumbler with the opeh hand the problem in this case as shown on preceding page is to lift a glass of water making it adhere to the palm of the open hand you will readily guess that the effect depends on the existence of a partial vacuum be¬ neath the hand but you may be glad to know how such vacuum is to be obtained the method is simplicity itself it is as followsplace the glass on the table and lay the palm of your hand over its mouth bending down the four fingers at a right angle as shown in the low r er figure of our illustra¬ tion this done if still resting the palm of the hand on the edge of the glass you quickly raise the four fingers so as to have the hand outspread as in the upper figure you will have produced beneath your hand a partial vacuum sufficient to enable the atmospheric pressure to overcome the force of gravity and the tumbler of water will remain attached like a cuppingglass to yourhand to balance an egg on tiie neck of a bottle insert into an ordinary cork one on either side as seen in illustration on pre¬ ceding page two forks of exactly equal weight hollow slightly the lower end of the cork so that it may adapt itself with tolerable exactness to the larger end of the egg place the opposite extremity of the egg on the edge of the neck of a bottle holding it as upright as possible a curious com trick after one or two attempts you will find that the combination rests in equilibrium a curious coin trick take a wineglass of conical shape whose largest diameter is a shade larger than that of a silver dollar place at the bottom a dime and above it the dollar which should rest about a quarter of an inch below the edge and act as a sort of lid you may now announce that without touching either the glass or the larger coin you will make the dime fly out of the glass to do this you have only to blow smartly on the nearer edge of the dollar the coin turns on its own axis assuming a vertical position and at the same moment the compressed air forced by your breath under the dime makes this latter jump a selfbalancing plate out of the glass after which the dollar reverts to its original condition the experiment will succeed with wineglasses of various shapes a selfbalancing plate the bastingladle the modest sceptre of her majesty the cook has often played its part in the performance of some curious experiments apparently contravening the laws of gravity let us add to it its sister the skimmer and the two combined will enable us to place the edge of an inverted plate on the brim of a drinkingglass or the lip of a water carafe as seen in illustration on preceding page where it will remain in stable equilibrium hook the handle of the ladle on to the edge of the plate and wedge it up tightly with a slice of cork so that it cannot shift to either side with the left hand apply the edge of the plate to the neck of the waterbottle and with the right hook the skimmer on to the bowl of the ladle after a few trials moving the edge of the plate backwards and forwards over the neck of the bottle you will hit the exact position in which it will rest equilibrium the force of the breath when you blow into a paper bag in order to swell it out afterwards bursting it with a blow to produce the familiar bang have you ever stopped to ask yourself what was the precise force of your breath you know that such force can be measured by the instrument known as the spirometer which you occasionally see at a railway station or a country fair but a simple paper bag may be made to answer the purpose of the spirometer as i propose to explain the bag must be rather long and narrow air tight and of thin tough paper lay it hat near the edge of a table with the mouth turned towards yourself place various weights upon it increasing by degrees and you will be surprised at the weight that your breath will thus lift to upset a couple of websters dictionaries placed one upon the other will be mere childs play as you will find on putting the matter to the test an animated siiadow there is nothing very complicated about the experiment we are about to describe but our readers will find it very much easier to comprehend if instead of merely reading our explanation they will try it for themselves everybody knows that if you place yourself between a lighted candle and the wall your body will throw a shadow on the latter but such shadow will only be in profile and you cannot expect to see within its compass eyes nose or mouth i am about to describe a method which not merely supplies these absent features but will even make the eyes roll from side to side and the mouth furnished with teeth of portentous size open and shut as though eager to devour some member of the company to produce this effect you must place yourself at one cor¬ ner of the room near a wall to which a lookingglass is at¬ tached the person who holds the light behind you must are range by varying as needful its elevation and distance from the wall that the reflection of the light in the glass shall fall exactly on the same spot of the wall as the shadow of your head the reflection of the glass will appear as a luminous oval or rectangle within the shadow if however you cover the mirror with a sheet of stout paper in which you have cut out as shown in our illustration two eyes a nose and mouth as grotesque as you please the luminous rays passing through these openings will alone be reflected and will appear duly placed as shapes of light in the middle of the shadow of your head with the effect shown in our illustration to make the experiment still more startling you may cover the mirror with two papers cut out in like manner one being fixed the other movable this latter you will move as may be needed in front of the other when the spectators will as i have stated see the eyes roll and mouth open in an alarming manner to pass a persons body through a playingcard if you chance to be at an evening party and somebody obliges with a few card tricks invite the performer when you see him approaching the end of his budget to pass himself through a card he will probably reply that he will do so if you find him a card big enough but the problem will seem more for¬ midable when you tell him that you mean a playingcard of ordinary size not to keep him too long in suspense you take a card and cut it longitudinally down the middle stopping just short of each end as shown by diagram no 1 of our illustration you fold the card in half along the line of the incision and then with a pair of scissors you make a succession of cuts through the double thickness from each side alternately as shown in diagram no 2 again unfolding the card and drawing its ends apart you will find it transformed into an endless extensible band composed of a number of little slips joined together the angles between them becoming less and less acute as you pull as abovementioned till they are drawn sufficiently far apart to allow you to pass the card over and around your body or your body through the card as you have undertaken to do to drive a needle through a penny to drive a needle through a penny par¬ ticularly if the needle be a fine one seems at first sight an impossibility it is however a very easy matter if you set about it in the right way all you have to do is to thrust the needle through a cork allowing the point to project slightly and then with a pair of cutting pliers nip off all that remains exposed at the opposite end place cork and penny as shown in our illustration on preceding page or simply let the coin rest on a piece of soft wood and hammer away vigorously on the top of the cork holding it in position with the left hand the needle being steel is harder than the copper of the coin and the cork preventing it from bending to either side it may be driven through the penny or any other coin of like substance with perfect ease the divided pear the problem in this case is to find the position in which a knife must be held that a pear suspended high up near to the ceiling shall on the severing of the thread to which it is attached so fall as to cut itself in half upon the blade there is no necessity for line or plummet we need only to dip the suspended pear in a glass of water which we forthwith remove the water drips from it we note the exact spot on the floor or table where the drops fall and make a private mark on such spot this is done privately beforehand so that the company on their arrival find the pear suspended in readiness for the feat and know nothing of the telltale drop at the proper moment you hold the knife edge upwards immediately over the point which you have marked while someone applies a lighted match to the thread if you have duly followed our instructions the pear in falling should cut itself in half upon the blade for the experiment as above described one knife only is used but it may also be performed with two knives as shown in our illustration on preceding page the knives must cross each other over the precise point where the drop falls the pear will then cut itself into four pieces which may be caught on a plate or tray held just below the knives a few preliminary trials will be desirable before attempting to show the experiment in public to spin a penny upon the point of a needle beml a hairpin as shown in our illustration on preceding page place a penny horizontally on the righthand hook which should be narrow enough to clip it closely and hang upon the lefthand hook a tolerably heavy finger ring or two if one is found insufficient place the free edge of the coin on some upright point that of a ladys bonnetpin for example and you will find that the com¬ bination can be made to balance itself furthermore by gently blowing upon the ring you can set the apparatus revolving rapidly without any disturbance of its equilibrium if you spin the penny upon a very sharp steel needle you will find that the needle will at length work its way completely through the coin you may therefore if you please propound your puzzle in this rather striking form how to bore a hole through a penny by merely blowing upon it the bottle and the keys take six keys in descending gradations of size for facility of reference we will call them com¬ mencing with the largest 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 respectively place nos 1 and 2 with their bitts resting on the table and pass the bow of no 2 through that of no 1 as shown in the figure the two keys will make a tolerably obtuse angle and by pressing downwards with the hand on their bows it may be ascertained interlocked and that neither of them is likely these two keys serve as a foundation for the that they are solidly to slip on the table rest you now pass the bitt of no 3 through the bow of no 2 and then in suc¬ cession the bitts of nos 4 5 and 6 through the bows of nos 3 4 and 5 meanwhile making sure by looking down on them from above that they are all in the same vertical plane if the successive interlockings of the bitts within the bows have been prop¬ erly made which you will ascertain by a gentle pressure on the key no 6i which crowns the edifice nothing will be easier than to make the bows of nos 5 and 6 the position of this last being all but horizontal support a variety of articles of domestic use to enhance the effect the more fragile the article the better say a plate a souptureen a decanter or a bottle if a bottle be used it should only be half full so as to keep its centre of gravity low down this increases the stability or perhaps we should say decreases the in¬ stability of your rather precarious structure to drill a hole with a needle through a pin the pin is stuck in the head of a cork into which are thrust one on either side two penknives of equal weight should there be a trifling difference in this particular it may be got over by varying the degrees of opening place the head of the pin on the end of your finger and open or close the blades of the knives bit by bit till the pin rests exactly horizontal then transfer it to the point of a needle stuck head downwards in the cork of a bottle by blowing upon the cork which holds the penknives you may set the combination in movement revolving on the point of the needle further the needle will speedily begin to work a hole in the pin and will in due time make its way completely through it tiie fivestraw puzzle you are supplied with five straws of equal length about three and a half inches and you are required to lift all five holding only the tip of one of them how is it to be managed our illustration answers the question a glance will show you the arrangement of the five little straws and the coin in their centre which is as will be seen as simple as possiblewhen you know it the use of the coin is an optional addition it wedges all tight and prevents the straws slipping when once put together but it is by no means indispen¬ sable if you propound the problem to an uninitiated person you will be surprised to find how long a time he will expend before finding the solution puzzles of this kind have in them a scientific element which interests the intellect while they at the same time train the hand to delicacy of manipulation an optical illusion cut strips out of a visitingcard in such manner as to transform it into a sort of parallelbarred grating as shown in the figure and then move up and down behind it a narrow strip of paper or card cut perfectly straight from end to end and pivoted on a pin thrust through one corner of the larger card when the movable bar is pretty nearly perpendicular to the bars of the grating its edges will appear straight but as you slope it more and more with reference to the bars its edges will appear more and more to deviate from the straight line as if broken into little steps this is especially striking when the bar reaches the lowest position shown in our illustration when it is only by actually ap¬ plying a ruler to the edges of the bar that you are enabled to resist the optical illusion we have referred to and to satisfy yourself that these apparently distorted lines are in reality perfectly straight a lifesized dancingdoll this is a little amusement which requires absolutely no preparation and which is within the reach of everybody place yourself beside a wardrobe having a mirror door as shown in our illustration in such manner that onehalf of your body is hidden the other half projecting beyond the front of the wardrobe to a person facing you at a proper distance it will appear that he sees your whole person inasmuch as the visible half of your body is reflected in the glass causing the illusion that the whole is seen if you raise the visible arm the spectator will see another arm of like shape and position elevate itself in the mirror so that you will appear to raise both arms so far you have not done anything out of the common for it is not difficult to lift both arms at once but it will be quite a different thing when you come to raise the leg shown beyond the glass in sucli case the glass will give the reflection of a second leg lifted simultaneously so that your body having to all appearance quitted its point of support on the floor you will seem to be lifting both legs at once like a jumping jack when the string is pulled the magic dart take an ordinary sewingneedle of medium size with a good sharp point stand at three paces distance from a door or wooden partition and holding the needle between your finger and thumb try by throwing it as strongly as you can to make it stick in the woodwork try as you will however great your skill or unwearied your perseverance you will never succeed now however pass through the eye of the needle a simple bit of thread and try again you will succeed every time in planting the needle in the door or piece of woodwork you have chosen for the target the little bit of thread you have added has transformed your needle into an effective dart and makes its point almost as a matter of course strike and penetrate the object against which it is thrown so remarkable a result will not fail to excite the astonishment of the spectators and you will be gratified by hearing on all sides complimentary re¬ marks upon your extraordinary skill the conjurer comus who was the inventor of this feat covered the use of the thread by a very artful expedient he made the company select among a number of threads of different colors that which lie was to use in order as he said to prove that it was the chosen needle and no other that was fixed in the partition the use of the thread which in reality formed the secret of the trick was thus made to appear a mere expedient for proving that there was no deception the reader wull find in this experiment a reminiscence of the dart composed of a penholder with paper wings as shown at the foot of our illustration with which we were all familiar at school and which has brought many a luckless wight to a modern tantalus g rief for practicing the throwing of the javelin when he ought to have been studying homer or virgil a modern tantalus place a chair on the ground so that the front shall rest on the floor the back and the two hinder legs being in the same horizontal plane invite some person to kneel on the rail which crosses between the two hind legs and while in that position to pick up with his mouth a lump of sugar resting on the back of the upper rail the thing at first sight seems a very easy matter but if the person who tries the experiment is not careful to bend his knees and draw his body well back on his hams so that his centre of gravity shall remain in the rear of the seat of the chair it will inevitably tip forward as shown in our second illustration and the victim like a modern tantalus will see the sugar shoot away from him at the very moment when he thinks he has secured it candle lighting under difficulties in a modern tantalus the experiment of the gentleman kneeling on the rail of a chair which we have entitled a modern tantalus the difficulty of maintaining the balance lies in the direction of the length of the body and the novice as we have seen tips forward in the recreation we are about to describe the victim rolls over side¬ ways to right or left at his selection or as the fates decide the feat to be performed is as followstwo persons kneel on the ground facing each other each holds in his left hand a candle in a candlestick at the same time grasping his right foot in his right hand this position compels him to balance himself on his left knee one of the candles is lighted the other is not the holders are required to light the unlighted candle from the lighted one the conditions as will be seen are simple enough but you would hardly believe how often the performers will roll over on the floor before they succeed in lighting the candle it will be found de¬ sirable to spread a newspaper on the floor between the com¬ batants many spots of candle grease will thus be intercepted and the peace of mind of the lady of the house proportionately spared the obstinate cork take a winebottle and a cork of a size considerably smaller than its mouth say the cork of a medicine phial place it just within the neck of the bottle held horizon¬ tally and invite anyone to drive it into the bottle by blowing it in the thing seems simple enough the experimentalist blows with all the power of his lungs but the cork instead of being driven into the bottle flies out in his face and the more smartly he blows the more vigorous will be its exit he tries again this time blowing gently but the result is the same the cork will insist on coming out instead of going into the bottle the explanation of the phenomenon which is very amusing to lookerson is as followswhen the experimenter blows upon the cork a certain quantity of air is at the same time forced into the bottle and is compressed with so much energy that it forms an elastic cushion behind the cork which pressing against such cushion is rapidly shot out again if you have proposed a bet on the subject you will certainly win unless indeed your adversary happens to be which i trust for his own sake he may a reader of queeries which will furnish him with not one only but three ways of getting the better of the obstinate cork 1 since if you blow on the cork it is driven out again by the air which is thereby compressed in the bottle try whether you do not succeed better by adopting the opposite plan i e by exhausting the air by so doing as you will find on trial you create a partial vacuum within the bottle the moment your mouth leaves the neck air rushes in to fill the void and the cork carried forward by the current thus produced slides comfortably to the bottom of the bottle 2 a partial vacuum or rarefaction of the air may be pro¬ duced by warming the bottle over a lamp or before a fire this done the current of cooler air from the mouth will drive the cork into the bottle 3 lastly if you have at hand a small tube of any kind say a straw a pipestem or even a stick of macaroni you have only in order to succeed to blow through this tube pointing it squarely at the base of the cork which will immediately enter the bottle a startler for a careful housekeeper there is no rose without its thorn and it must be admitted as the one drawback to the magic of common things that when the u common things in question take the form of the best tea set the experiments are apt to cause materfamilias some anxiety of mind the experiment we are about to describe is of this kind you are required to balance a coffeecup on the point of a carvingknife the accessories are simple enough in fact you find them all at hand when you taive your seat at the dinnertable a cork a tablefork nothing more is required save indeed the knowledge how its done and the skill to do it pass the cork through the handle of a coffeecup it should fit tightly enough to be a close fit but not so tightly as to part cup and handle next thrust the fork into the cork two of its teeth on either side of the handle of the cup in such manner that the opposite end of the fork shall incline slightly towards the bottom of the cup the centre of gravity of the whole being a startler for a careful thus made to fall below the cup you place the latter on the point of a knife and by successive trials you will in due time find the exact spot on which it will rest in equilibrium the underside of teacups being usually enameled there must be no trembling of the hand which holds the knife or the cup would slip and fall at the outset it is well to keep the opposite hand close to the handle of the fork so as to be able to seize it and save the cup in case of a fall the second portion of our illustration shows another method of producing the same effect a couple of tableknives crossed being substituted for the fork a final hint if you wish to make sure of your coffee drink it before you try to balance the cup the rotation of the globe when you next chance to eat an egg for breakfast do not fail to try the following experiment it is one which always succeeds and is productive of much amusement to the company moisten slightly with water the rim of your plate and in the centre paint with the yolk of the egg you see you have not far to go for coloring material a sun with golden rays by the aid of this simple apparatus you will be in a position to illustrate so clearly that a child can compre¬ hend it the double movement of the earth which revolves simul¬ taneously round the sun and on its own axis all that you have to do is to place the empty half shell of your egg on the rim of the plate and keeping this latter duly sloped by a slight movement of the wrist as may be needful you will see the eggshell begin to revolve rapidly on its own axis at the same time traveling round the plate the slight cohesion caused by the water which moistens the plate counteracts the centrifugal force and so prevents the eggshell falling olf the edge of the plate a paper fish made to swim at pleasure out out of ordinary paper a fish as shown in our illus¬ tration in the centre of the body must be a circular opening a com¬ municating with the tail by a narrow canal a b place water in some ob¬ long vessel a fishkettle will answer and lay the fish carefully on the water so that its underside shall be thoroughly wetted though its upper surface remains dry you may then challenge the company to set the fish in motion without touching or blowing upon it they will probably 44 give it up this is all you have to do pour delicately one or two drops of oil within the circular opening a the oil will strive to spread itself over the surface of the water but it can only do so by traveling along the little canal a b by a reactive effect the fish will be impelled in a direction opposite to that in which the oil escapes or in other words forwards and the movement will last long enough to set the spectators wondering at this strange movement of a mere bit of paper on the surface of the liquid a move¬ ment which if not initiated in they will be wholly unable to account for a plate balanced on a needle everyone who has visited a circus or a musichall has seen the familiar jugglers trick of spinning plates saladbowls and other household utensils on the tip of a pointed stick the object spun is usually of wood or metal and its equilibrium is only temporary depending upon centrifugal force and coming to an end as soon as the rotatory movement is no longer strong enough to counter¬ act the force of gravitation the method we are about to describe goes farther than this by its aid an ordinary plate may be sup¬ ported in a condition of stable equilibrium on the point of a needle and may even be set spinning while thus delicately poised split a couple of corks down the middle and into each of the four halves thus obtained thrust the prongs of a tablefork forming with the flat surface made by the cut a little less than a right angle place the four corks thus weighted round the plate at equal distances as shown in our illustration on preceding page taking care that the teeth of the forks are well home against the edge of the plate so as to prevent 44 wobbling the plate thus loaded may be balanced upon the point of a needle thrust head downwards into the cork of a bottle by careful manipulation so as to prevent slipping you may set the plate spinning the rotatory movement will continue for a consider¬ able time the friction at the point of contact being practically nil pencils balanced in midair the object of this experiment which we specially dedicate to young gentlemen at school is to balance in space two leadpencils the one in a horizontal position with its point resting on a needle or suspended by a thread the other upright with its point resting on the opposite end of the first pencil our readers are by this time so familiar with the principles of balancing as illustrated in our previous experiments that this will require but little explanation the two knives of equal weight keeping the pencil horizontal see the illustration will recall the experi¬ ment of the pin perforated by a needle as described on another page the balancing of the second pencil kept perpendicular by the aid of a couple of penholders is a very hackneyed feat but the combination of the two seems to us sufficiently original to be worthy of special notice if our young readers have rigged up the arrangement with sufficient care they may even set it spinning round the point of suspension once started it will revolve for a considerable time the selfbalaxced ladle with the aid of the ordinary basting ladle to be found in every kitchen we are enabled to exhibit a balancing experiment wherein the centre of gravity is not merely brought below but carried to one side of the point of suspension place a half opened pocketknife on the edge of a table as smwn in the drawing hook the shank of the ladle over the angle made by knife and blade the concavity of the bowl being turned towards the table and leave all to itself the knife will rock and the ladle swing backwards and forwards till they rest in stable equilibrium if you now fill the bowl of the ladle with sand the knife will not fall but on the contrary its angle will rise higher and higher a problem in gymnastics place a low stool on the floor close against the wall and yourself facing the wall with your feet distant from it just double the width of the stool stoop down and grasp the stool with one hand on either side and rest your head against the wall now lift the stool from the floor and slowly raise yourself to the erect positionor rather endeavor to do so it is better to try the experiment for the first time on a well carpeted floor on polished oak or parquetry you would probably have a nasty fall a problem in gymnastics we have here a curious effect of the displacement of the centre of gravity of the body which renders it almost impossible to stand upright without first replacing the stool on the ground and resting the hand upon it to get the needful support to balance a pencil on its point our illustration supplies without need of further explanation the solution of the prob¬ lem you have merely to dig the blade of a halfopen penknife into the pencil a little above the point and to open or close the blade little by little till you find that the balance is obtained the combination of pencil and pen knife thus placing itself in equilibrium is an illustration of a familiar law of mechanics the centre of gravity of the combination to balance a pencil on its point falls below the point of support the finger the edge of the table or the like and thus stable equilibrium is obtained robinson crusoes pen our pen which we will christen with your permission the pen of robinson crusoe is no other than the twin leaf of the scotch fir pinus sylvestris or seaside pine pinm maritima strip from the branch of pine a case with its two needles as shown in fig 1 of our illustration draw the two needles together by means of a bit of thread tied round them near the points as shown in fig 2 here you have a pen furnished with the orthodox pair of nibs sharp enough for anything and ready to write what¬ ever you may desire by way of penholder thrust your pen into the cavity of a short straight piece cut from the branch of another tree say lilac or elder allowing the two points to project half an inch or so or still better fix it in a pipestem as shown in fig 3 the large diameter of the case will prevent the pen slipping altogether into the extempore penholder jnow dip your pen into the ink stand do not remove it at once as you are accustomed to do with other pens but let it rest a little while in the liquid by virtue of capillary attraction the ink will rise in the tube formed by the con¬ junction of the two needles and your pen will very shortly be so well charged with ink that you can write twenty or twentyfive lines with it before you need to make another dip in the inkstand fine flexible and proof against corrosion our pen will answer every purpose longhand shorthand large text small text old english or engrossingall are within the capabilities of the robinson crusoe pen a bridge of lucifer matches we have here a method of bridging with lucifer matches an intervening space equal in length to two or more such matches this is effected by building with such matches a skeleton bridge of very elegant construction the matches must be of the oldfashioned large square pattern now relegated to the kitchen having obtained the right article you will have no difficulty in putting the framework together its construction is simple enough lay match no 1 on the table and upon it at right angles to it the ends of nos 2 and 3 and across these lay 4 now with the thumb and forefinger of the left hand lift no 1 and with the right hand slide in nos 5 and 6 passing over 1 and under 4 from the way in which the timbers are interlaced the whole will form a portion of an arc its centre rising slightly from the table place 7 across and over 5 and 6 and 8 across and under the ends of these same two matches gently lift 8 and introduce beneath it 9 and 10 whose lefthand extremities after passing under 8 must rest on 7 and so proceed until your bridge has attained the desired dimensions j lark had made her nest in the early spring on the young green wheat the brood had almost grown to their proper strength and attained the use of their wings and the full plumage of their featheis when the owner of the field overlooking his crop now quite ripe said the time is come when i must send to all my neighbors to help me with my harvest one of the young larks heard his speech and related it to his mother inquiring of her to what place they should move for safety there is no occasion to move yet my son she replied the man who only sends to his friends to help him with his harvest is not really in earnest the owner of the field again came a few days later and saw the wheat shedding the grain from excess of ripeness and said i will come myself tomorrow with my laborers and with as many reapers as i can hire and will get in the harvest the lark on hearing these words said to her brood it is time now to be off my little ones for the man is in earnest this time he no longer trusts to his friends but will reap the field himself selfhelp is the best help now then the mother said we must be gone wgm ii where shall we hide it where oh where cried a little fluttering bird of the air she had searched the marshes and meadows ov r er thicket and hedgerow sprouting wheatfields grass and clover her mate had left her there in the dew for the very peak of heavens blue a tenor singer he was and sweet where the ariettas he dropped from cloudland down at her feet i will leave it all to your womans wit and will sing while you are deciding it he said and went soaring aloft upup spilling his music as water is spilled from an oerful cun soon she discovered the very best the cunningest cosiest spot for a nest right where the wheat grew green as could be in the wind glistening tumbling and rolling tossed like the sea there was the dear nest skillfully made five little freckled green eggs in it laid softly she hovered there striving to tell just where the pretty things pecking and rapping would peep from the shell long had the hours seemed while she sat there had it not been for the song in the air even by looking up she could descry that little feather speck sending down tunes to her out of the sky what was it stirred so under her wings higher her mate soars louder he sings five little birds hatched each one a lark ah when they fledge and fly how will all summertide listen and hark ripening slowly all round the cosey house hidden and lowly grew fast the little flock speckled of breast gaping their hungry mouths till overrunning was the home nest warn wagged every wheathead yellow of beard almost the harvest watchful lark feared so when abroad they flew searching for food worms caterpillars midges or beetles they warned their brood r if any noise you hear hover each other any strange voices near call to your mother for when the grainfields yellowing stand ripened for stack or thatch then do the reapers come sickle in hand one day a strange step paused near their bed and the old farmerman thoughtfully said aye it is ripe enough i will go find some of my neighbor folk to help me cut it rake it and bind wildly the nestlings hearts flutter and beat scarce had they breath the grim news to repeat laughed the lark mother fie do not worry if he depends on friends then take your ease my dear there is no hurrv so when another day farmer once more planned for the neighbors help just as before all the wise little ones smiled with disdain there is no danger yet here in our golden grove we can remain av but the time came at last when with dismay parent larks heard the bluff old fellow say well wait no longer for others my son but bright and early well go at the work ourselves then twill be done now then the mother cried pack up your things try well your bills and feet shake out your wings soon as you spy the first glimmer of dawn even though the heavy dew drabbles and drenches us we must be gone why piped the little lark why oh why hush hush the father sighed hushwe must fly long as he counted on other mens aid so long in shelter of harvest ungathered we could have staid but you have heard him say to his son theyll cut the grain themselves now twill be done then such a flurry rose such stirring whirring that even the field mice wondered and marveled what was occurring when dawns red sparkles kindled the dew up from the wheatfield seven larks flew up far as arrows shot from a bow while far below them sickles where whetted grain was laid low m a wee wee woman was little old dame fidget and she lived by herself in a wee wee room and early every morning so tidy was her habit she began to sweep it out with a wee

to market herself a kid v»v w to sweep for the cinders though never were there any she whisked about and brushed about humming like a bee when odd enough one day f she found a silver penny shining in a corner as bright as bright could be just then dai and whistled to him and cried pray dog bite kid kid wont go 1 see by the moonlight tis almost midnight and time kid and i were home half an hour ago and that she did next day but ah the kid proved very lazy and it moved toward home so slowly she could scarcely see it crawl at first she coaxed and petted it and then she stormed and scolded till at last when they had reached the bridge it would not go atall jut no he said he wouldnt so to the stick she pleaded pray stick beat dog dog wont bite kid kid wont go i see by the moonlight tis almost

stick began to beat the dog to the dog began to bite the kid and the kid began to go and home through the moonlight long after midnight the little dame and little kid went trudgingoh rslow for all were merely lads not one was able so small he was when he was born so tiny to earn the crust of bread since then he had become though scant it might be coarse and black and humble thatfor he was no bigger than your finger with which he must be fed they called him hopomythumb and worst of all the youngest one was puny so odd and still and slight that father mother and the other brothers thought him not over bright now at this time for days and days together there fell no drop of rain the corn shrunk on the stalks and in the sunshine rustled the shriveled grain as if a fire had swept across the meadows they shriveled in the drouth and what this meant for the poor fagotmaker was famine without doubt one night he sat before a smouldering fire his head bowed down with grief trying with those weak wits of hito compass some scheme for their relief his wife above the feeble embers hovered and wrung her toilhard hands she knew there was no help for their starvation no hope in making plans at last he spoke ah bad luck to the trying i cannot find them food tomorrow morning with me to the forest ill take the little brood i cannot bear to watch this piecemeal starving so while they run and play or gather fagots for me or pick berries to eat ill come away oh groaned the wife im sure the wolves will eat them poor dearspoor little dears yet do as you think bestwe all must perish then went to bed in tears meanwhile though all the rest were sleeping soundly hopomythumb had heard and at the thought of wolves and woods in terror his little heart was stirred and so he lay and planned and early dressed him and ran with all his might down to the river where he filled his pockets with pebbles small and white and as they started for the wood he lingered somewhat behind and when they came to dismal places dropped in secret a pebble now and then then all but hopomythumb wailed out affrighted dont cry so hard said he ill find the path if youll but keep together and try to follow me by the white stones strewn on the dead pine needles though night had fallen he soon led the way out and spied their humble cottage low lying neath the moon thick grew the trees twas twilight in their shadows although broad day without but gay the laddies at the fagotpicking went scampering about and chattering like a flock of busy sparrows till having hungry grown they turned to ask their mother for their dinner and found they were alone they hurried near and pausing at the window hopomythumb climbed up and peeped within his father and his mother were just about to sup someone had paid them two gold guineas on an old debt and when they went for beef for two they were so hungry they bought enough for ten quick as a flash the ravenous seven went rushing pellmell into the house nor left of the fine roast upon the table enough to feed a mouse it all went well long as the money lasted when that was gone once more the father planned to take them to the forest and leave them as before but when once more they found themselves deserted and little hopomythumb felt sure to lead them out he found the finches had eaten every crumb then what to do they wandered hither thither for hours in dread and fear until at last they saw with fitful glimmer a feeble light appear it shone but faintly like a single candle but trudging towards the ray they reached a house and knocked the door was opened after a brief delay again they went through brier and through thicket into the darksome wood again he dropped his clues along the pathway behind him when he could and a kind woman asked them what they wanted they said to stay all night run run away the faster you run the better she answered in affright hopomythumb who heard again the plotting crept from his trundlebed but in the place of pebbles in his pockets put only crumbs of bread an ogre lives here cruel and bloody minded he eats up little boys run run i hear him coming from the mountains i know him by the noise but we cant run we are so faint and tired hopomythumb began tis all the same whether the wolves shall eat us or your good gentleman and so she took them in fed them and hid them all underneath her bed and in a minute more they heard approaching tramp tramp an awful tread it was the ogre coming home his supper was steaming nice and hot two calves upon a spit ten rabbits roasting a whole sheep in the pot he banged the door wide open sniffed and snorted i then in a dreadful voice i roared out while his poor wife stood by and trembled 1 smell seven little boys in vain she told him twas the mutton scorching the veal had browned too fast he searched the house peering around and under and reached the bed at last then dragged them one by one out fairly shouting nx at little hopomythumb 5f saying the lads would make towards a dinner k six mouthfuls and one crumb au oh leave them till tomorrow cried the woman youve meat enough tonight well so i have he said ill wait a little fe ah ugh theyre plump and white now it so chanced the ogre had seven daughters and all slept in one bed a lar e e room an d each wore for a nightcap a gold crown on her head and hopomythumb when all the house was quiet into their chamber crept and the gold headbands for himself and brothers stole from them while they slept he scoured the country rumbling like a tempest far near they heard his roar until at last his sevenleague feet grew tired and he could go no more and down he lay to rest him for a minute the day had grown so hot close to a rock where lav the seven children 9 although he knew it not and hopomythumb creeping from out his crevice with greatest caution drew the ogres boots off these would shrink or widen just as you wished them to wicked and sly it was he knew the ogre would no doubt rise at dawn and being but half awake would kill the children who had no nightcaps on t wife fetch my sevenleague boots at once he shouted ill catch the vipers yet he stamped his feet into the magic leather with many a muttered threat hopomythumb spoke softly to his brothers run fast as ever you can and leave me to take care of mr ogre and hurryscurry they ran then hopomythumb awakening his brothers whispered make haste and fly without a word they did as they were bidden in twinkling of an eye out in the drizzly mist of a gray morning off through the chill and dew and none too soon within an hour the ogre his dreadful blunder knew and off he started over hill and valley seven leagues at every stride the children saw him like a giant shadow but they could only hide and sure enough he did he was so drowsy and fogs so veiled the sun that whetting up a huge broadbladed dagger he slew them every one and put them on himself then he decided to hasten to the king and as he traveled towards the royal palace each boot was like a wing there was a war the king had need of service in carrying the news he heard his tale and said tll use this fellow who wears the magic shoes so little hopomythumb made mints of money and his whole family lived very easy lives and from his bounty grew rich as rich could be as for the ogre in his sleep he tumbled down from that ledge of rock and was so bumped and bruised he never rallied but perished from the shock and hopomythumb whose influence in high places was certain to prevail made the kind ogress who had hidden and fed them duchess of draggletail a shepherd boy who watched a flock of sheep near a village brought out the villagers three or four times by crying out wolf wolf and when his neighbors came to help him laughed at them for their pains the wolf however aid truly come at last the shepherd boy now really alarmed shouted in an agony of terror pray do come and help me the wolf is killing the sheep but no one paid any heed to his cries nor rendered any assistance the wolf having no cause ot fear took it easily and lacerated or destroyed the whole flock there is no believing a liar even when he speaks the truth n idle lad a loitering lad was the only son th shepherd had he knew the cleanest sunny corner of every village street mw he liked as well as any other the curbstone for a seat and he stood as if an iron anchor were fastened to his feet i the father said and shook his head ah me hell never earn his bread nor even the salt to salt his porridge though bread and salt w r ere cheap and how can i plan it any better than to have him mind the sheep the meadows were sparce the pasture stony the hillside bleak and steep so day by day half soyr half gay he loafed the summer hours away he w r atched the white flocks cropping cropping or huddled in the shade and heard for voices the drowsy jangle the one small sheepbell made with now and then the piteous bleating of a lamb from its mother strayed i nothing to do the whole day through no one to talk with that he knew what wonder his mind was a field for folly and that like a wicked seed it sprouted there to grow and blossom into a naughty deed satan will find some mischief ever for idle hands we read £««« down the hillside as if terrified one day he ran and running cried wolf wolf the simple folk of the village came out with great concern left bench and desk and shop and counter the dreaded news to learn left needle and awl and nail and hammer left cradle oven and churn from every door peered one or more till the roused ones numbered twice a score a wolf they queried and armed with a shovel with sickle or hoe or spade with broomstick poker tongs or ladle with cleaver or saw or blade they swarmed along to the threatened pasture and a fine display they made they crowded they ran the millerman was white with flour and dustwith bran the tailor had on his big brass thimble but the chopper had no ax the women left their humdrum treadles where they were spinning flax and joined the march though forced to carry their babies on their backs they reached the rocks there were the flocks grazing with burrs in their woolly locks but where was the wolf so fierce and hairy the wolf so gaunt and spare with white fangs glistening and red tongue lolling ready his prey to tear not even so much as a dewwet footprint t feta was visible anywhere a then wondering greatly back sedately they turned to the work theyd left so lately while the boythe worthless little rascal thinking of what hed done and left once more to his own devices laughed aloud at the fun till from his eyes like the drips of a shower from the eaves the water run what need to be so dull cried he when simply one little word from me can bring abroad these silly people and give them such a chase for an hour at least my stupid pasture was quite a lively place and again the merry wrinkles puckered the muscles of his face no hurt nor blame from this frolic came but the lagging days droned on the same ever a gray blank or a blue one the sky was overhead ever the sheep kept cropping cropping and yet were never fed ever he longed for the village gossip but silence had instead therefore to repeat his wolfcry cheat he thought might serve as a jovial treat and again through the street he sped and shouted just as he did before and butcher and baker and candlestick maker ran zealously out once more it seemed that dozens of women and children issued from every door did they find the foe of the flock ah no they saw through the twofold humbug though and when to their workshops and their houses returning an angry crowd with hands on their hastilygathered weapons each one declared and vowed there never had been so base a swindle while the ladhe laughed aloud now it chanced next day as he sprawling lay whistling his vagrant breath away a wolf in truth all gaunt and hairy came stealing from the wood a grizzlyskinned and leanribbed giant it right before him stood with white fangs glistening and red tongue lolling and great eyes shot with blood pellmell he fled whether heels or head were uppermost could scarce be said help help wolf wolf he cried till echo help help wolf wolf replied over stock and stone he leaped believing the lank beast at his side the strength of his lungs increasing trebled help help wolf wolf he cried did the butcher baker and candlestick maker the weaver brewer and undertaker and ever r little old man and woman rush out this time to see ah no the blacksmith swung his hammer the woodman chopped his tree the granddame whirled her steelbright spindle as placid as could be the baker baked the gardener raked the mower mowed till his shoulders ached the pretty schoolmistress ranged her classes ready to read and spell a girl peered over the windlass handle £ to see herself in the well tjfj the carpenter planed the tinker tinkered the merchant tried to sell not the glance of an eye nor word of reply was given the crier or the cry hes a mischiefmaker a goodfornothing they silently agreed and that he is allowed to make such a clamor is a burning shame indeed the wilder his terror the more he shouted the less they seemed to heed too sad to tell too cruel to tell is the fate that those poor sheep befell left thus by a false and foolish shepherd to meet a foe so grim he hunted them scattered them overtook them and rent them limb from limb for a pack of his leanribbed grizzly brothers gave savage aid to him so the lazy lad the loitering lad the only son the shepherd had became a byword in the village of folly and distrust flocks lost he could not earn his living he was fed on the merest crust he cheated he idled we couldnt believe him his neighbors said tis just trotting along the first one saw a man who carried a bundle of straw give me some straw for a house and bed the little pig said straightway not even waiting a bit the kind man did as he was bid and the little pig built a house of it but he was no more than settled before a wolf came along and knocked at the door taptap and cried little pig little pig let me come ini a h very very poor was she old dame pig with her children three robust beautiful little ones were those three sons each wearing always without fail a little fanciful knot in his tail but never enough of sour or sweet had they to eat and so one day with a piteous squeak did the mother speak my sons your fortune you must seek and out in the world as they were sent the three pigs went but the pig replied no no by the hair of my chinny chin chin c the old wolf grumbled and added beside then ill huff and ill puff and ill blow your houac in he was gray and big and he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house in and he ate up the poor little pig the very next day all blithe and gay the second little pig went marching away to the world to find his fortune and when he met two men who bore on their shoulders bunches of furze my gentle sirs give me some furze for a house and bed the little pig said they gave it him freely every whit and the little pig built a house of it but he could no more than get in before the wolf came along and knocked at the door x little pig little pig let me come in but the pig replied 4 no no by the hair of my chinny chin chin then the old wolf growled and added beside then ill huff and ill puff and ill blow your house in he was fierce and big and he huffed and he puffed and he puffed and he huffed and he mew the house in and he ate up the poor little pig and then the third little pig went out with his curly tail and his saucy snout up to all kinds of pranks and tricks and he met a man with a load of bricks and he said i suppose you are perfectly willing to give me those by the begging he got them every one and in a trice was the house begun and very shortly the house was done plastered and snug and nice and along came the same wolf as before and knocked at the door thump thump and cried little pig little pig let me come in cut the pig replied no no by the hair of my chinny chin chin then the wolf filled his cheeks out on each side like a bellows to blow and he howled oh ho then ill huff and ill puff and ill blow your house in well he huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed but with all his huffing and all his puffing sa the house would not fall in and so despite his appetite he was forced to go with never a bite and for once at past was cheated out of the little pig with the saucy snout of the wily kind though he was and he whined i know little pig where we can find some nice fresh turnips pig grunted where 1 oh over at smiths in his home field its not far there if its pleasant weather shall we go together tomorrow at six yes piggie squealed but what should the little pig contrive but to rise at five next day and to go through the early dew to the field where the turnips grew they were plenty and sweet and he ate of them all he cared to eat and took enough for his dinner and then went home again the wolf came promptly at six oclock gave a friendly knock and asked the pig are you ready to go why id have you know ive already been there and beside ive enough for dinner the pig replied the wolf saw then he was cheated again but i know wheres a lovely apple tree in a winsome voice said he and the wise little pig from where he sat peered outand smiled wheres that at the v iiy garden if youll be fair and its pleasant weather we two together at five in the morning will go there ah sly and cunning the little pig was for as early as four he was out next day and running running hoping to get the apples before the wolf was up but the apple tree proved twice as far as he thought twould be he climbed the boughs in the greatest haste and thought to himself ill only taste as a bit of a lunch but soon crunch cninch he had eaten a scorethen what should he see but the big gray wolf just under the tree yes there he stood trying to look as meek as he could and he said little pig are the apples good pig thought he should fall from where he sat so heavy his heart went pitapat but he answered the nicest under the sun ill throw down one the wolf ran after it as he threw it and before he knew it the pig was out of the tree and as fleet as his four little feet could scamper he fled on into his house while after him sped the wolf with a savage voice and face in a furious chase he was long and slim but the little pig proved too swift for him
