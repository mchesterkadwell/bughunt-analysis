PREFACE  The following Essays have been written not with a view of  teaching Entomology as a science but of affording such a  measure of acquaintance with the habits of the Insect world  as may serve to promote the ulterior and more useful design  of cultivating the rudimental seeds of systematic investigation  Eor this with many sufficient leisure fitting residence and  other appliances may be wanting but few can entirely lack  opportunity for becoming more observant of Natures wonders  more impressible to her influences and her teachings or  more alive to the superior intelligence visible in her works  On nothing perhaps are the signs of that intelligence more  obviously impressed than on the operations of Insects which  as creatures preeminently under the rule of instinct attest  as pre eminently that   The mind which guides them is divine  Thus contemplated the constructive skill selecting judgment  and seeming foresight of these tiny agents as applied to the  preservation of themselves or offspring are exalted into themes  of surpassing interest and as in all created things there  exists a purpose out of and above themselves it is evident in  these displays of instinct that the same informing principle  which serves in its operation to direct the animal actor is  intended by its exhibition to amuse and to instruct the rational  spectator To further however little these latter purposes is  the design of the ensuing pages it only remains to add a  few words explanatory if not propitiatory of the mode in  which this has been attempted  It is an approved device and not a new one to employ  amusement as conducive to higher purpose To besprinkle   Di soave iicor gli orli del vaso  to sweeten the lip of the cup whether it contain instruction  in things natural or things moral has been the practice in  every work seeking popularity from the sacred Epic to the  familiar Exposition but to that now attempted of the ways  and wonders of the Insect world it may possibly be objected  that not merely is the cup sweetened at its lip but that  mingled in its contents are ingredients foreign and discordant  in other words that the descriptive may be deemed too  highly coloured by the imaginative So at first sight it is  not unlikely to appear to those especially who possess no  previous acquaintance with the subject but as this is  partially unfolded it may perhaps become apparent that  allegoric fable poetic association and moral analogy are no  forced productions but only the luxuriant growths leaf flower  and fruit of that branch of the tree of knowledge which  belongs to Insect history  It may also be noticed that in the still prevalent though  daily lessening indifference or distaste to members of the  Insect race there exists an obstacle to their general study  only to be overcome entirely by waging gentle warfare against  prejudice where prejudice is always seated in the feelings  and not in the understanding To make Insects objects  of liking would seem therefore the best preparatory step  towards making them subjects of learning and to accomplish  this the writer has endeavoured to associate them as much  as possible with our domestic habits the s umm ers stroll  the winters walk whilst exhibiting them in their nmnerous  relations with other departments of Nature especially the  Floral high as this already stands in universal love and  admiration  To Entomologists those especially whose pens and re  searches have opened varied paths to their pursuit little  information is offered in the following discursive sketches  yet it is diffidently hoped that even readers of this descrip  tion may find amusement in an hour of leisure from the  inspection of a light and fanciful fabric based upon founda  tions of their own laying From their intimate acquaintance  with the body of the structure the Real they are at all  events well qualified to appreciate the fitness if fit of its  allegorical decoration the Ideal  CONTENTS  AND  DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIONS  BUTTERFLIES IN GENERAL  Various species just risen and bursting from their chrysalidan shrouds mount  towards the skies or repose upon everlasting flowers  The lowest Butterfly to the left is the Peacock i Vanessa Io that above is the  Common Copper Iycana Phlceas the next above is the Common Blue  Polyommatus Alexis and that to the left is the same showing its  under wing painting Above these upon the sprig of flowers is the Lady  of the Woods Anthocharis Cardamines and over this to the right is the  Brimstone Gonepteryx Rhamni having the HairStreak Purple Thecla  Quercus to the left and the Silverwashed Pritillary Argynnis Paphia  above In the centre is the beautiful SwallowTail Papilio Machaon  to the right below is the Red Admiral Vanessa Atalanta perched  above showing its underwing is the small Garden White Pontia Rapce  over that a little to the left is the Meadow Brown Hipparchia Janira  and uppermost upon the flowers is the Common Copper Lyccena Phlceas  exhibiting its underwing Suspended to the branches beneath are  numerous chrysalides one of which exhibits the small Tortoiseshell  Butterfly recently emerged  To the symbolic meaning of this picture it is scarcely needful to point for in  the Book of Nature so truly described to be a Book of Emblems the  history of the fugacious Butterfly as typifying the flight of the immor  tal soul stands foremost for clearness for exactitude for beauty and for  solemn import  So issue forth the Seasons  First we have Winter in his merriest mood represented by the Cricket  bedecked with Christmas holly and alive with fun and jollity By his  right hand he holds the Brimstone Butterfly emblem of Spring prim  rose of papilions in habits and in hue Beneath the jocund Grasshopper  linked to the above by a vernal wreath figures the bright Summer  and in the glowing Peacock Butterfly rich in her velvet train as  the autumnal flowers she frequents we welcome Autumn bearing the  ripe sheaf and presenting her merry associate with the fruit of the vine  1 THE CRICKET INTRODUCTORY Page  The House Cricket Acheta domestica gaining access to the milkjug by a

CRICKET INTRODUCTORY  THE POINTS OF OUR HOBBY  FLIES IN WINTER AND A FLY LEAF  THE GNAT A LIFE OF BUOYANCY  THE WOODANT AND THE APHIDES  THE CRICKET INTRODUCTORY  And Criekets sing at tlie ovens mouth  As the blither for the drouth Shakspere  An eminent Erench Entomologist Reaumur lias very justly  observed that it is certainly no fault of Natures if we do not  possess works upon Insects which everybody may read with  pleasure His most amusing though rather voluminous  publication Memoires pour servir a THistoire des Insectes  1734 went far to supply in his time the deficiency at which  he hints and in ours amidst the multitude of familiar books  on every subject it might certainly be supposed that there is  no lack of such as would suit and please everybody on this  natures cabinet  No inquisitive mind need complain of any want of keys for  the simple opening of that drawer in Natures cabinet a drawer  of gems which has been labelled Entomology Of these  there are an abundance gilded keys of popular as well as iron  keys of scientific manufacture but the still prevailing want is an  incitement to place them in the lock The works of Kirby and  Spence Rennie and Jardine Burmeister and Westwood may  be said to furnish preeminently the gilded or with reference  to their intrinsic worth the golden keys in question but  seeing how generally even these are left to tarnish on the  shelf something would seem to be required as an incentive to  their more frequent handling  The most prevalent feeling about Insects except perhaps  the busy people of the hive or the painted populace of  the garden is that of indifference if not distaste and who of  the multitude thus ignorantly prepossessed would seek for  books strictly devoted to their history or believe that they  could find interest in the mere relation of their instincts however  pleasantly detailed  The first anxiety of a writer is as all the world knows to  establish a kindly sympathy between himself and his readers  but how can this be speedily created betwixt one who as an  Entomologist would seem to think of nothing but Insects and   the many who have always regarded them as below a passing  thought With even a slight knowledge once acquired of  their w r ondrous ways the latter will be induced to a confession  that these Minims of Creation are something even in  themselves but it may be well meanwhile for him who would  bring them into general notice to invest them with the charm  of adventitious interest and reflected consequence Insects are  peculiarly capable of being thus treated for in their analogies  and correspondences illustrative and emblematic innumerable  are their relations with other things from the most trifling  objects of the world we live in up to the highest subjects of  human contemplation Multiplied then and still multiply  ing as are books on Entomology we venture to think there is  yet scope and use for one of a character more discursive a  book not professing to teach the science but to persuade to  its study those who may have time and opportunity for the  pursuit and to show those who have not that they may  nevertheless find interest and pleasure in common observation  not commonly exercised of the insect million by which they  are surrounded With a confidence that some such work might  be generally read though by no means equally assured of our  ability to write one we long had wavering thoughts of making  the attempt At last we resolved to try reminded by a re  turning epoch a brush en passant from the wing of time  that while we doubt and linger   La vie a differer se passe  The end of the year was at hand Tomorrow said we to  ourselves we will really begin our work for every body about  Insects This very evening shall be devoted to a final decision  on its plan for under a hundred Protean forms and almost  as many different names had our intended work been floating  for months before our minds eye Letters Sketches  Conversations these were familiar shapes into which our  materials might be moulded but they seemed in one sense  too familiar the public taste might be tired of these hacknied  modes of dressing up the sister sciences Besides clothing  such as this however light would overmuch confine us in  the very discursive rambles which we had thoughts of taking  amongst our creepers and fliers and swimmers Episodes might  better serve our purpose and impose fewer shackles on our  roving fancy Episodes then they shall be called Episodes of  Insect Life providing every month a seasonable admixture of  the Real and the Ideal But tomorrow and for a month to  come what insects will be in season Of all the summer  myriads the bulk have long ago expired the remnant scared  even by the shadow of advancing winter betook themselves  to hidden places and now old Christmas has benumbed them  with his icy paw and keeps them unconscious prisoners  within the earth or waters  We may still discourse it is true of torpid Bees of sleeping  Ants of buried Beetles and a forlorn few of widowed Wasps  stupified by grief or cold sole relics of their perished race  but what a drowsy doleful prelude would this be to the cheerful  airs we would draw from the harp of nature These insect  sleepers would furnish us with themes of life in death for in  all of them under forms of death forms of vitality arrested  or unexpanded lie hidden as in all real deaths merely  natural are contained the germs of life Even this departing  year does not wholly die since being full fraught with causes  seeds which are sure to ripen into the fruit of consequences  in these it will continue to live to the end of time aye even  to eternity but believe and philosophize and hope as we may  neither death nor deaths semblances are the most enlivening  objects of contemplation At all events we felt our spirits  growing flat and our thoughts confused as we looked at our  waning candle like the year approaching to its end and  reviewed the subjects defunct or drowsy from amongst which  we must perforce choose one for that of our opening essay  Dreaminess trod on the heels of dullness and before we had  come to a decision as to what sleeping insect should constitute  our commencing theme we were ourselves nodding beside our  solitary fire  Suddenly we were awoke by a clang of bells from the  neighbouring steeple of our parishchurch the requiem of the  departed and salutation to the newborn year It was soon  pealed out and we were left once more to the silence of our  little parlour a silence which seemed deeper than usual and  more solemn yet not to the spirits ear unbroken for it is in  pauses such as these on lifes rattling road that the small  still voice is always audible unless it be drowned as is common  by the noise of social mirth We sank into a reverie regretful  more than hopeful of retrospect rather than of prospect and in  the current of mingled thoughts that rushed over it our lately  ruling and uppermost idea that of our contemplated book  was completely overwhelmed Of a sudden however it was  again brought to the surface a shrill sound broke upon the  stillness another chorus within the house succeeded to the  hushed peal without The Crickets from the kitchen below  were uplifting their chirping strains to salute in full concert  the newcome year We were at no loss now for at least  one cheerful subject wherewith to commence our Episodes  Bless their merry voices for the opportune suggestion Eorth  with we took up not our pen but our candle and descended  to the lower regions of which we found our chirpers left in sole  possession The noisy varlets broke off instanter in their song  and each to his hole or cranny scampered off at our approach  but we captured a straggler in the very act of draining the  milkpot and carried him off to our parlour fireside for the  cultivation of a more intimate acquaintance and with a view to  making him as well known to our readers by sight as he  or rather his merry fraternity are likely to be already by  sound Einish thy song there little Master and with what  appetite thou mayest thy supper too said we as we placed  our lean lankbodied prisoner beneath a tumbler under which  we were so merciful as to insert a few crumbs of bread one  of the Crickets favourite repasts Aye leap as thou wilt  and climb against gravity up the smooth walls of thy crystal  prison there thou shalt abide till we have taken thy portrait  Yes queer creature as thou art thy angular figure and round  physiognomy shall be exhibited in our first vignette Thou  shalt be honoured as our opening subject and if thy name  had not served already the purpose of one whose sympathy  with thy merry chirrup has been shared by thousands thou  shouldst have given a title to our book like The Bee  and other seekers and gatherers of Sweets Thou art in truth  an omniumgatherer nothing comes amiss to thy convenient  appetite and variety must be the character of the feast we  would provide no less than of that which thou lovest to  devour True as we have said thou art not particular scum  mings of pots sweepings bread yeast flesh and fat of broth  thy pickings most esteemed seem not some of them the most  inviting fare yet do these dainties each in its kind serve to  symbolize not unaptly the very sort of viands we would seek  and set before our readers  Bor scummings of pots suppose we say the cream of our  subject the most light and withal the richest of the agreeable  matter already laid up by others to be extracted by ourselves  in the field of observation Bor sweepings let us put   gleanings Gleanings in Entomology and we have the  very term adopted by a wellknown writer for his amusing  anecdotes in various branches of Natural History Then  bread with Cricket as with man the very staff of life if  poverty forbid him not to grasp it what substance more properly  symbolic of that which must form the groundwork of our  book matters of solid fact mixed with and lightened by  the yeast of illustration discursive and pictorial As for  the flesh and fat the strongest fare on which the  Cricket delighteth to regale may they not serve to typify  that principle of mental nourishment of all the most vital  afforded by the religious contemplation of all natural objects  endowed with life  The Cricket is the thirstiest of all thirsty creatures He is  not therefore   the blither for the drouth  for where no ampler supply of liquid is at hand he is said  heed it ye careful housewives to gnaw holes in wet woollen  stockings or flannel hung by the fire to dry Therein also  though in more harmless fashion we would make him our  representative as thirsting after knowledge of our subject  we strive to extract from it even when seemingly most arid a  something of refreshing moisture  Lastly in all his doings our Cricket is confessedly a  pilferer and taking as we largely must from stores collected  by the labours and observations of others we shall herein  also resemble our prototype except that we rob in open  daylight and thankfully acknowledge what we appropriate  There are yet other points of resemblance more personal  between ourselves and the house Cricket As with him a warm  hearth in winter and a sunny bank in summer are the seats of  our supreme felicity Like him also we joy in the  possession of a quiet retreat and prefer to uplift our voice  from behind a screen  We have now set forth quite as much of our design and  revealed as much of our personality as have come connected  with our immediate subject and from the scattered grains of  intimation already dropt some prying reader may even now  have gleaned more about the Crickets ways and whereabouts  than we have thought it expedient to reveal Something more  of them may be disclosed hereafter Meanwhile surmise what  thou wilt good gossip but above all we entreat thee to  bear in mind that alike in our proper and our emblematic  character we most heartily rejoice in all that warms and all  that cheers Remember this dear reader and be kind try  to look sunbeams or firelight on these our weak and broken  chirrups for according as thy smile shall encourage or thy  frown repress they may speedily sink into silence or rise into  a more powerful and grateful song  THE POINTS OF OUR HOBBY  No joyless forms shall regulate  Our living calendar Wordsworth  What have we here P A May Ely in January A magnified  May Ely Verily Master Cricket thou dost not only magnify  but most unseasonably misplace the objects of Creation  strangely too dost thou misapply them for in seating thy  domestic self upon the back of this ephemeral highflier we are  quite at a loss to guess thy meaning Then gentle reader  guess not at all only have patience and all seeming incon  gruities shall be reconciled Suffice it now that as in the  Cricket we have introduced thee to our symbolic self so in the  May Fly we would beg thee to recognise our symbolic hobby a  hobby we confess it whereat even under her imposing name  Entomology all her sister ologies were once in the habit of  kicking up their heels as they left her disdainfully in the rear  Of late however she has been gaining ground and now promises  to keep up with the proudest jade among her fellows But  without invidious comparisons let us proceed to put her through  her paces and show how in pursuit of e charming variety she  carries us through roads as varied Now like an ambling palfrey  she bears us over flowery meadows now like a flying Pegasus  mounts with us through air now descends beneath earths  surface then plunging in the stream opens to us new worlds  beneath the waters In these her endowments of amphibious  character we may notice the first points of resemblance between  the features of our favourite and the habits of the May Ely  Day Ely we also call her and so she is in her brief career  through the summer sky but before she has ever fluttered or  had wings to flutter in air each May Ely has lived in earth aye  and under water caverned in the bank of her native streamlet  where at present she abides The comparison holds good  still further no Ephemera can now disport itself in air  nor in the fields of air is there now much of pleasant pasture  for our hobby but the Day Ely of next May is in no want of  food or doubtless of enjoyment though confined to earth and  water and in these does our hobby still possess an ample  supply of winter exercise and provender  Dear Entomology We have called thee our hobby we  have likened thee to a hack but thou art more Thou art a  powerful Genie a lightwinged Dairy not merely bearing us  through earth and sky and water but peopling every scene  in every element with new and living forms before invisible  For us Nature has now no desert places touched by thy  magic wand every tree has become a peopled city teeming  with busy multitudes every flower a pavilion hung with  gorgeous tapestry for the summer occupation of Insect nobles  clad in velvet gauze or coat of mail nay the very moss  that grows upon the tree or clothes the stone has become  to us a forest where as in forests of larger growth roam the  fierce and the gentle preying or preyed on by each other and  the stone we have only to upturn it and we are certain  almost to discover beneath some hidden lurker or some  wondrous subterranean structure perhaps a solitary dwelling  perhaps a nursery perhaps a general home of refuge Yes  our darling pursuit of all most lightsome and lifegiving  with thee for our companion the bare the barren the desolate  and the deathlike become instinct with life The arid heath  the decaying tree the mouldering wall are converted at once  into fertile fields of interest and inquiry while the summer  skies and glittering waters grow brighter yet with glancing  wings and oarlike feet and with the knowledge that both are  plied by a multitude of happy creatures  But stand still our favourite hobby We must draw in  thy rein or matteroffact people will declare that thou art  careering with us beyond earth or sky or water even into  the intangible realms of Imagination They would do us  wrong but to prove ourselves as fond of fact as they and  thou our favourite no phantom horse we will een dismount  and ere w T e start with thee on fresh excursions tell something  of thy birth and parentage and point out other of thy excellent  merits in more sober fashion  Entomology signifies the study of Insects from whose pe  culiar formation the term owes its origin the bodies of this  part of the Animal Creation being msected or divided into  three principle parts head trunk and abdomen besides other  subdivisions Eor this reason the Latin name Insecta Greek  r E vrofjLd from whence Entomology  Now of these little insected animals thus curiously divided  from the rest of animated nature except the Crustacea  once also classed as Insects many great men of antiquity  philosophers as well as poets thought no scorn Among these  Aristotle Pliny and Yirgil wrote of them largely though  indeed somewhat erroneously the former with other similar  fables asserting not only that flies were meat engendered a  notion still ignorantly entertained but that they also inherited  a disposition fierce or harmless according to that of their  fleshfathers when in life Quite as absurdly though more  poetically Yirgil says or sings of Bees that   From herbs and fragrant flowers  They call their young  With these and similarly confused notions about the origin  of Insects and other created beings their beauties and wonders  had certainly much less claim upon the notice of the ancients  than on ours who have acknowledged them for the work  of one Divine Hand and regarded them as visible tokens of  that Divine Mind of which they are thus permitted to afford  us a partial revelation but since with incentives comparatively  slight the study of nature in general and of Insects in  particular was yet deemed by enlightened heathens worthy of  infinite attention is it not strange that the classic robe which  has so often lent a dignity to a host of insignificances should  not at least have defended poor Entomology from neglect or  ridicule Yet so it has not been  On the revival of general learning there appeared in Europe  a few works in which Insects were noticed among other objects  of natural history but it was not we believe till the reign  of Charles the First that they obtained in England the honour  of a whole Latin book to themselves and were introduced to  the learned public in MouffeCs Theatrum Insectorum The  history of this book is curious and in a manner correspondent  to the ephemeral subjects on which it treats for in the successive authors who began continued but never lived to finish  it we are furnished with striking instances of the fragility and  uncertainty attendant on the designs and labours of the  Insect Man The foundations of the work were laid by the  celebrated Conrad Gesner and Dr Wootton and upon these  a considerable structure was raised by Dr Penny a physician  and botanist in the reign of Elizabeth but lie too after  fifteen years of partial employment died and left it incom  plete His manuscripts purchased by Mouffet a contemporary  also a physician were arranged augmented and prepared for  the press but ere he had time according to his intent to  dedicate this fruit of his own and other mens labours to the  maiden Queen he as they had been before him was summoned  to submit all his works to the judgment of the Court Supreme  His book lay buried with him till in the next century it was  once more brought to light and published by Mazerne a  court physician An English translation followed and a  curious old book it is giving a complete view of all that was  then known on the subject of Insects with much informa  tion since confirmed and with it an infinitely larger portion  of gravely and quaintly affirmed nonsense perhaps not the  least amusing part of the production It is amply adorned  with figures many of them amusing too from their very im  perfection Some of the greatest men are perhaps to be  found among those who pursue little objects those we mean  held as little in general estimation such people are great in  their discernment to discover the real worth of what is com  monly despised and they are greater still in their independence  of spirit to follow up objects whose pursuit exposes them to  ridicule and whose attainment is little likely to bring them  admiration or repute Well in the 17th century several  gifted individuals in tills sense very great appeared and took  neglected Entomology by the hand Chief among these were  the English Ray and the Dutch Swammerdam Insects were  then found capable of exciting enthusiastic energy incompa  rable patience and fervent piety Oh says Swammerdam  while studying for his work on the habits and structure of  Bees Oh for one year of continued light and heat that I  might work without interruption Such was his enthusiasm  In his admirable dissection of Insect anatomy he has left a  record of his perseverance equalled however by Boerhaave  who could employ a whole day in clearing one Caterpillar  from its fat and by Lyonnet who counted 1804 aerial tubes  in the body of another whose structure formed the chief study  of his life and for piety that of Swammerdam finds ardent  expression in the following apostrophe drawn forth by the  wonder and beauty of those divine mechanisms which patience  had laid open to his own and others observation Oh  God he exclaims how Thy works infinitely surpass the  reach of our feeble understandings all that we actually know  of Thee or ever can is but a faint and lifeless shadow of Thy  adorable perfections in contemplation of which the brightest  understandings grow bewildered With the same feelings  inspired by similar objects our venerable Ray composed his  work called f The wisdom of God manifested in the works  of Creation And again it was the interest excited by  Insect forms their singularity and surpassing beauty which  in the same era inspired the artistic pencil of a Merian and  induced her with a womans energy to cross the seas and  brave the noxious climate of Surinam for the sake of its  curious and splendid Insects These she has as truthfully  depicted though misled perhaps by her own enthusiasm  into a too ready credence of the marvellous the accuracy of  her accompanying descriptions has been more than questioned  Thus in the latter end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th  centimes a few among the most highly endowed with talent  learning and piety considered the study of Entomology not  unworthy to constitute the grand pursuit of life yet at this  very period in such low estimation was it generally held nay  so extravagant or childish was it deemed that we are told by  Kirby of an attempt to set aside the will of a rational woman  Lady Glanville on the ground of lunacy evinced solely by  her fondness for collecting Insects Kay himself had to appear  as a witness of her sanity How was it that his own escaped  impeachment P For all this and calmly smiling at the scoffs of  the vulgar ignorant and vulgar learned Entomology marched  on steadily supported by a phalanx of staunch professors such  as Keaumur called the French Pliny Lyonnet Bonnet Gould  the historian of English Ants the Swede Baron de Geer and  at the head of all his illustrious countryman Linnseus Of  the previous labours of Kay and Swammerdam the chief had  been directed to tlie internal organization of the Insect race a  theme though of infinite curiosity by no means adapted in its  elaborate details to attract the general reader but the  naturalists of the 18th century above noticed with the ex  ception of Lyonnet devoted their attention more to the works  and ways the structure and economy of Insect communities  or individuals subjects highly amusing and except in the  nearly fabulous narrations of antiquity almost new yet for all  this charm she never so wisely Entomology had still few  charms for the public De Geer whose History of Insects  has been pronounced above all praise on publishing the first  volume of his work in 1752 found it so ill received that  instead of being devoured by readers numerous impressions  were devoured by the flames to which they were consigned by  the disappointed author In nineteen years however a great  change came over the public taste the second volume of his  work was eagerly received and De Geer presented a copy of  it to the then select few who had bought the first The  Memoires t of Beaumur though less systematic than the above  are yet more interesting and in spite of their prolixity so full  of curious matter apt illustrations and lively remarks that  a more amusing book can scarcely be found even for the  general reader provided he be a person of taste  From the glowworm light in which it had so long glim  mered Entomology now shone as it were in the radiance of  a swarm of Tireflies Yet this her augmented brightness  did but serve for a season to make her a more conspicuous butt  for the shafts of ridicule and many a quill was shot in  derision at this persecuted science which could only have  been aimed with any show of fairness at her merest classifiers  and collectors such as every branch of Natural History may  number among the lesser minded of its votaries But even  persons like these who would seem in the words of the  satirist to   Think their eyes  And reason given them but to study flies  may still perhaps be followers of objects not a whit less  insignificant than those which occupy their neighbours only  that the pursuits of the many escape ridicule because they  are sought along the high ways instead of the bye ways of  wasted life But the laugh at Entomology is nearly spent  Known professors of the science and members of its   Society may now assemble in council and communicate  their observations and enquiries without fear of becoming  themselves subjects for a commission De lunatico inquirendo  and Butterflyhunters net in hand may now chase their game  without being themselves made game of In recent times  the works of Latreille Lamarck Cuvier Curtis Leach  Macleay with many more have been gradually improving the  science which their names adorn while Kirby and Spence  Rennie J ardinet Knapp J Burmeister and Westwood Â§  have published their researches to the multitude in works  which were they as popular as they should be would have a  place not only in every library but in every bodys hand to  serve literally as handbooks in their country rambles  Return we now to the great volume on which the above  are but imperfect commentaries that volume bound in  etherial blue and at this our chosen chapter printed in  living characters on leaves of every tint from vernal green  to the richest hues of autumn nay on the brown or snow  white sheet of winter for at no season is the student of Ento  mology presented with an entire blank Even in the month of  January besides our chirping representative of the hearth  and certain Gnats which disport over frozen pools a sprinkling  of other Insects may be seen melting their frosted fluids in  the wintry sunbeam or the sheltered window Numerous  others hidden from all but practised eyes are laid up snugly  in various hybernacula of which the discovery adds a zest to  their pursuit Of these some are concealed in caverns under  ground some in beds of mud beneath the water some are  ensconced in hollow trees and behind or in crannies of their  bark while others lurk within the tunnels of dry perforated  stalks sleep within the domes of protecting gallnuts or lie  defended from frost and famine in other homes of shelter such  as the care of Him who careth for all has led them to seek out  Using our hobby as a hunter we may pursue our game for  two different objects that of observation or collection or both  combined And we may collect for two different purposes  that of scrutinizing living instincts or arranging and looking at  dead objects The relative value of one and the other is as  that of an apples rind to its juicy pulp the rind is not  without its use and beauty while connected with the interior  of the fruit neither is a collection of Insect specimens as  connected with the juicier matter of the study they illustrate  As for him whose delight in natural objects of what kind  soever consists solely in their amassment or is circumscribed  within the walls of his cabinet he is no naturalist at all a  mere kindred spirit of the Bibliomaniac and little better than  the miser whose iron heart is in his iron chest Neither are  specimens necessary to the study of Insects though like the  Hortus Siccus of the botanist they are of great assistance  especially at its commencement Subsequently if you should  desire to collect we would recommend the pursuit for this  purpose of one selected tribe say Beetles as the most varied  and perfect or Butterflies and Moths as the most elegant and  interesting of the Insect classes The study of the latter  only in the search after Caterpillars the feeding them on  fresh leaves of such plants as they frequent and the oppor  tunities thus afforded of watching them through their changes  transformations and most ingenious labours will afford ample  occupation and amusement for nearly every season of the  year and moreover present us if we choose a collection of  cabinet paintings in whose exhibition and contemplation  always with reference to their Great Designer we may take a  laudable delight But here ere it be declared let us anticipate  the objection of some gentle reader who numbering us with  those who kill Butterflies for amusement may have already  pronounced us worse than a Domitian who killed flies  for the same purpose only Now there is no subject probably  on which there has been more straining at gnats and split  ting of straws than that of cruelty to animals as connected  with our own pleasures Take for example the gentle Poet  of the Seasons that most eloquent advocate of oppressed  animals yet Thompson was a fisher not an angler mark  ye but a flyfisher Accordingly the welldissembled fly  he considers a harmless ruse and bids us   Fix with gentle twitch the barbed hook  and then adds beseechingly   But let not on that hook the tortured worm  Convulsive twist in agonizing folds  forgetting the convulsions of the agonized Fisk with a hook  in its lacerated jaws and gasping for its native element  And now as a collector of Insect specimens though that  save for a temporary purpose is not our profession let us  endeavour with what dexterity we may to split our own  straws or lay hold on such of them as may serve to rescue  our hobby from a flood of censure To take the little life even  of a Butterfly is confessedly and ought to be matter of pain  and is so far a setoff against the pleasures of an Aurelian  Nor is it a setoff which use diminishes for the more we  notice the beauty of Insects and the more we learn of their  movements the greater becomes our reluctance to mar the  former or arrest the latter by an unwilling hastening of the  hand of death It is only our moral right to do so on sufficient  occasion for which we would contend True this is the  very thing that all are desirous of proving who with old  Isaac feel in the cruel pleasures of their darling pursuits  that other joys are but toys still argue as they may on  no principle can it be allowable to toy with torture To  take life quickly and with far less suffering to the individual  than what in the common course of nature it will for ever be  liable to undergo all must admit to be a different matter   Well be it so now retorts perhaps some fair and loving  champion of the weaker cause yet we doubt your privilege  to cut off the delight of a Butterfly taken in haste  among the beautiful flowers for the sake of your own  to be taken at leisure in the scrutiny of her beautiful  wings An unkindly cut we own but the moral right  we still assert Pleasure for pleasure compare the sensual  pleasures of a Butterfly versus the mental pleasure of a Man  such as can scarcely fail to be excited by a close examination  of natures miniature masterpieces of painting and mechanism  and for once we may fairly claim for ourselves le droit du  plus fort as one which if it so please us we may justly exercise  For Aurelians or collectors of Moths and Butterflies this  month and the following constitute one of the great harvest  seasons Trowel in hand they are now repairing to the leafless  woods where carefully digging a few feet around the trunks of  the trees they disquiet and bring up from their winter  catacombs the mummy like aurelias of various Moths which  as Caterpillars have fattened in summer on the foliage above  Such as are disposed to become Aurelians themselves must  have in readiness for their treasures thus exhumed boxes of  wood or pasteboard partly filled with vegetable earth and  covered at top with gauze The Chrysalides consigned to their  earthy bed there should be laid over them a green coverlet of  moss which once a fortnight in winter and oftener in summer  should be steeped in water for the purpose of giving moisture  to the mould beneath  Among the numerous projets of Reaumur suggested by  his favourite pursuit was one for the establishment of a sort of  public menagerie for Insects and perhaps in the present  speculative era a worse scheme might be hit on than the  opening of an Entomologic Garden Who knows but that  by help of such adjuncts as flowery walks and Fetes al Fresco  ladies might be tempted to face Antlions at home in their  sandy pitfalls as well as Manlions not at home in their iron  cages and condescend even to take a general survey of the  figures and fashions the costumes and customs of other Insect  tribes when so collected in a convenient focus as to require  only the trouble of looking at instead of looking for Might  we not insure a modicum of royal and noble patronage by the  introduction of some such foreigners as a company of Walking  Leaves or a group of Spectral Branches from China providing  a grand morning concert of screaming Cicadas from Greece or  Italy and an evening illumination of Chinese Lanthorn Carriers  and American FireFlies  But to leave trifling let us now recur to that perpetual  charm of the Insect world which consists in its intimate con  nection with the vegetable kingdom Viewed according to their  mutual relations of use and adaptation the flower and the  leaf seem almost instinct as well as associate with animate  existence while their Insect frequenters appear in return to  have borrowed a share of floral elegance and sweetness  Various writers on Insects afford partial information as to the  plants on which they are generally to be found and a little  French workt treats wholly on this subject but it is  still very imperfectly explored and sure to be attended in  its cultivation with discoveries of new Insects and unobserved  habits of those already known As an instance of their  numbers and variety we are told that one collector found in  forty days between June and the beginning of August no less  than 2400 specimens and 100 new species not including  Caterpillars We have said that Insects are to be found every  where but if asked the best of all places for finding and the  best of all ways to seek them we should answer in your own  garden be it ever so confined and by close examination of  every tree and plant it produces flowers leaf and stem down  to the very roots and even below them Scrutiny like this will  make visible a multitude of strange little animals and half  visible a multitude of their wondrous ways to be made gra  dually plainer by further exercise of eye and mind for we can  tell you that in the divinely directed doings of the meanest of  them all there is something worth the looking into Lord of  Creation as you are you will soon see how the Insect is per  mitted to play the little Lord too over the good creatures  of the kingdom below him and how with tliis power he has  had conferred on him the skill to employ them each according  to its kind for habitation for food for clothing and for  pleasure Things such as these have a higher claim upon your  interest and admiration than the mere external beauty even of  a flower garden and when the flowers have all departed even  now when the leaves have gone the way of all things verdant  they will furnish you with novelties to look for and forms of  vitality to examine On the leafless branches on which at  present you may vainly seek for a budding promise of spring  you may yet find a promise of something more animate a group  of Insect eggs destined to emerge into life almost simulta  neously with the opening of the adjacent leaves sure to be in  readiness for the infant Caterpillars In this who can say that  Insect eggs are objects too small for admiration whilst they  are besides both curious and pretty on account of their variety  of arrangement shape colour and sculpture yes for the  design of their sculptured patterns We do not magnify as you  may prove by placing the next you find beneath a magnifier  Now all ye idle dwellers in pleasant places for to you  especially we address ourselves what say you to our hobby  Our Horse of Enchantment which like the Brazen one of  Fairy Tale and unlike most other hobbies of real life has yet  the further merit of costing nothing for its keep Why  master Cricket responds perhaps one of our pursuitless  plodders or a busy wight among the already mounted we  have yawned over the catalogue of thy favourites excellencies  and after all the most we can admit in favour of thy hack  is simply that it seems to suit its rider Thou hast painted  it indeed with prodigious pinions and dost prate finely of  being carried up and down and hither and thither on thy  boasted Bucephalus yet do we still set it down even on thy  own showing as of all steeds most mincing tame and quiet  fit only for the riding of a child or of a sexagenarian just the  thing therefore for a man such as thou master Cricket hast  figured thyself to be a retired gentleman of exceeding light  weight except in the scale of entomological society thy winter  fire the centre of thy world of comfort at home the summers  sun the centre of thy world of amusement without The world  proper the social stirring busy world having we suspect long  ago laid thee on its shelf a sort of cabinet antique thyself  thy cabinet pursuit is all in character 33 Well be it so good  reader and whether as to our person right or wrong we  thank thee for having thyself hit upon yet another and a  crowning commendation of our hobby and one moreover which  will shew further the fitness of the figure by which we  represent it Of the May Ely more in due season but what  common observer what common fisher knows not that the  early morning and the sunset eve are the times it always chooses  for its sportive exercise In like manner the pursuit of  Entomology in common more or less with all those directed  towards natural objects is one suited especially to the morning  and evening of life least of all perhaps to its active heyday  Somebody has said we believe justly that as our other  loves and likings weaken our love of nature strengthens  This is a yearning kindly implanted in that nature which  we call our own and well and happy is it when in lieu of  withered pleasures we have leisure to cultivate within us  such good seed of calm and innocent enjoyment as may  serve to adorn our autumns with something of the verdure of  a second spring As we each in our own career are compelled  to take the downward road we shall surely desire if ever to  exercise our several hobbies to some worthy purpose but how  few of them are capable of a single service except to amuse  the little hour of life or hardly this for are not most of  them discarded by their riders as worn out before them  But it is never thus with the gentle steeds which have borne  us through the flowery paths of nature To the end of time  these will carry us nay they will do more for where is the  path of nature which leads not from the world we live in  ascending to its Mighty Author and to the worlds unseen  of which in this and in its minutest objects we dimly discover  innumerable types and shadows P Will not then our mounted  May Fly alias Day Fly serve to symbolize an innocent and  pleasant pursuit such a one as may help at all events to make  the year pass as a day and that a day of May  FLIES IN WINTER AND A FLY LEAF   And his two pretty pinions of blue dusky gauze  Are glued to his sides by the frost Wordsworth  The Flies are gone but where are they gone to that is the  question At the close of summer when they are busy and  buzzing around us in the shape of a visitation it is certainly  no easy matter to let them pass by us as the idle wind  but in one respect they are to most people like the wind too  since they scarce know whence they come or whither they go  Doubt the first as to whence they come is not difficult to  solve though perhaps with the most presuming of Flies as  with the most presuming of folks the more we pry into their  places of birth the more we may be inclined but with the  insect not justly to hold them in contempt suffice it that as  the domestic Fly makes himself quite at home in our houses  so has his parent in all likelihood made herself equally free  of our stables where she finds a hotbed for her eggs and in  the same a provision for her infant race There in their  first and wingless state of maggot or larva they commence thus  early their important use of helping to rid the earth of all tilings  that offend and on how grand a scale they are able to carry on  this operation may be estimated from the fact that a single Fly  will lay no less than 177 eggs House Flies come then chiefly  from the stable the road and the grazing meadow though  some nearly resembling them come from other places and  exist in their earliest state on vegetable instead of animal sub  stances Among these we have noticed a very common species  which finds its first bed and board between the upper and  under skins of dockleaves burrrowing and feeding on the  pulpy flesh From spring to autumn we may see them thus  busily employed merely by gathering and holding to the light  such leaves as are to be found continually not adorned by  large discoloured transparent blotches the outward tokens of  their inward presence These from the above habit may be  ranked among a set of insect labourers or feeders of more  classes than one hence called Leafminers some of whose  winding ways we mean by and by to follow  For query the second and that just now more pertinent to  the season of whither flies go on the arrival of winter it  still remains we believe a problem not yet completely solved  even by naturalists who have maintained opinions on the matter  nearly as different as on the hybernation of swallows A great  proportion no doubt perish from cold or the many accidents  to which their weakness and growing torpor render them as  the year declines more and more exposed Yet how few  comparatively of the swarms so agile head downwards on  the ceiling do we ever perceive or our housemaids either  stiff and stark legs upwards on the floor That Ely survivors  there are laid up snugly in secret hybernacula is further  evidenced by the few which are often seen emerging  from nobody knows where in mild winter weather also by  those more lonely bodies tempted by the warmth of the fire to  creep forth even in nipping frost Under such forlorn circum  stances a Fly becomes to us at least an object of absolute  interest our dislike amounting almost to antipathy of  the intrusive buzzing pilfering boozing tickling varlet one  of the dusky legions which possess us in the months of  August and September is converted into sympathy for the  poor mateless friendless shivering silent creature lured by  deceptive warmth to quit the shelter of his winter asylum We  would make him as welcome now to his tiny bit or sup as the  redbreast to his crumbs of comfort and on occasion would  even stretch out a willing finger to save him from a flood of  milk or a morass of honey Yet more when thus rescued  and set damp or dripping on the heated mantlepiece we have  often watched with curious and interested eye the poor  pilferers gradual restoration marking how at first languidly  and then with increasing briskness he busies his handy paws  now catlike stroking and wiping his head and face and  large moveless eyes then with his hinder limbs performing the  like operation on his wings and body Laugh at us who  laugh may sympathy with the meanest thing in adversity  needs no countenance from great names but if it did we might  shelter our bit of sentiment from the shafts of ridicule under  the broad shield of Wordsworth the great and good who  wrote the lines of our motto and also the following part of the  same poem on a forlorn fly tempted to his stove in Germany  on one of the coldest days of the last century 1799 After  contrasting his own warm comforts not indeed of a cheerful  fireside but of loving companionship with the shivering and  solitary estate of the Fly he continues   Yet God is my witness thou small helpless thing  Thy life I would gladly sustain  Till summer come hack from the south and with crowds  Of thy brethren a march thou shouldst sound thro the clouds  And back to the forests again  The poet was young when he wrote these lines but he in  whom the child was father to the man would not  disclaim them now that he is old  If the fly were endowed with only an atom of human  perception and human vanity nothing could be more natural  than her supposing with the little selfimportant busybody of  La Fontaines fable quelle fait alter la machine f not  merely that lumbering machine in the days of f le grand  monarque dept a coach but la machine du monde to  the progress of which she might well imagine her own march  and the march of flies in general to be necessary or mainly  instrumental How could flies think otherwise did they but  know that their own mode of progression their own method  of walking against gravity has been made a subject of most  grave discussion and profound enquiry amongst the Scientific of  Society Of this more anon but in very grave reality and as  we have already slightly noticed the agency of Flies is much  more powerful and important than most people think for in  assisting the progressive economy of our world of nature Its   wheels within wheels of natural machinery which would  otherwise be getting for ever clogged and impeded even to  mortal stagnation by impurities of every description are pre  served in great measure comparatively clean and in good  working order by the labours of the Fly which like those of  numerous other minor agents performed for their own little  ends are made by the Grand Mover of all things conducive to  a grand use The Flys purpose in nature says a modern  author is to consume various substances which are given out  by the human body by articles of food and almost every  animal and vegetable production when in a state of change  and given out in such small quantities that they are not  perceptible to common observers neither removeable by the  ordinary means of cleanliness even in the bestkept apartment  Under this view of extensive uses for which its structure and  habits are alike admirably adapted as well as for each other  both are well worthy of general observation and in no wise  beneath the scrutiny of scientific and what is more of sensible  people The mechanism even of a Elys foot thus regarded  we shall never be disposed to look back upon a Sir Joseph  Banks a Sir Everard Home or a pious Derham when busied  in its examination as upon children of a larger growth  curiously pulling toys to pieces and then remembering by  whom that mechanism was constructed we shall not be  surprised on finding that observers even such as these seem  after all to have been at fault as to its true principle On the  credit of their great authority books without number have  explained and still continue to tell us how the Ely walks  against gravity with equal ease upon a surface rough or smooth  upon our windows as upon our walls upon the ceiling as upon  the floor with back downwards and with back upwards and  yet as it would appear they have all told us wrong They have  said and asserted as proved beyond a doubt that the sole secret  of a Elys marvellous walk and hold is a vacuum the vacuum  produced by certain organs called suckers attached to  the end of the foot which either adheres by atmospheric  pressure or is left free to rise as these suckers re alternately  expanded or contracted Yet would it seem that in this  plausible doctrine of vacuity there may be a congenial nothing  after all its supposed facts of foundation seeming to vanish  before the asserted power of our little pedestrian to traverse  the sides and stick fast to the dome of an exhausted receiver  If then it be not by a vacuum by what something is it that  she does retain her hold Mr Blackwall who tried the  experiment of the receiver found also that a Ply enfeebled by  cold or other causes would climb with difficulty the sides of a  glass ascended before with perfect ease Further he observed  that Flies unable to stand back downwards on highly polished  bodies were able to do so on those slightly soiled and from  these and other observations considers that the apparatus  whereby they effect their hold is quite mechanical and closely  analogous to the pulvilli or fine hair brushes of other Insects  used as holders or supporters This modern notion nearly  agrees with that set forth almost 200 years ago by a Dr Power  who says that the Fly is provided with six legs and walks  on four The two foremost she uses as hands wherewith to  wipe her mouth and nose and take up what she eats her  other four feet are cloven and armed with little claws by which  she fastens on rugosities and asperities of all bodies like a  Catamount She is also furnished with a kind of fuzzy  substance like little sponges these are our suckers with  which nature hath lined the soles of her feet which substance  is also repleated with a white viscous liquid squeezed out at  pleasure to glew herself to the surface This aid of glutinous  secretion except in a very slight degree is now denied to the  performances of our wonderful climber au reste the notion of  our old Philosopher knocked down by the vacuum as if by  an air gun seems now set up again But are we assured  seeing how long mistaken notions will maintain their footing  that even now we are perfectly correct about the footing of the  Fly  A Fly on the wing is a no less curious object than one on  foot yet when do we trouble our heads about it except as a  thing which troubles us The most obvious wonder of its flight  is its variety of direction most usually forwards with the back  upwards like a bird but on occasion backwards with the back  downwards as when starting from the window and alighting  on the ceiling Marvellous velocity is another of its charac  teristics By fair comparison of sizes what is the swiftness of  a racehorse clearing his mile a minute to the speed of the Fly  cutting through her third of the same distance in the same  time t And what the speed of our steaming giants the grand  puffers of the age compared with the swiftness of our tiny  buzzers of whom a monster train scenting their game afar  may even follow partridges and pheasants on the wings  of steam in their last flight as friendly offerings But  however with their game the Flies themselves would be most   in keeping on an atmospheric line a principal agent in  their flight as well as in that of other Insects being the air  This enters from the breathing organs of their bodies into the  nerves and muscles of their wings from which arrangement  their velocity depends not alone on muscular power but  also on the state of the atmosphere  How does a Fly buz is another question more easily asked  than answered With its wings to be sure hastily replies  one of our readers with its wings as they vibrate upon the  air responds another with a smile half of contempt half of  complacency at his more than common measure of Natural  Philosophy But how then let us ask can the Great Dragon  Fly and other similar broadpinioned rapidflying Insects  cut through the air with silent swiftness while others go on  buzzing when not upon the wing at all Bennie who has  already put this posing query himself ascribes the sound  partly to air but to air as it plays on the edges of the wings  at their origin as with an Eolian harpstring or to the friction  of some internal organ on the roots of the wings nervures  Lastly how does the Fly feed P the busy curious thirsty  Fly that drinks with me but does not drink as I  his sole instrument for eating and drinking being his trunk  or sucker the narrow pipe by means of which when let  down upon his dainties he is enabled to imbibe as much as  suits his capacity This trunk might seem an instrument  convenient enough when inserted into a saucer of syrup or  applied to the broken surface of an overripe blackberry but  we often see our sipper of sweets quite as busy on a solid lump  of sugar which we shall find on close inspection growing   small by degrees under his attack How without grinders  does he accomplish the consumption of such crystal condiment  A magnifier will solve the difficulty and show how the Fly  dissolves his rock Hannibal fashion by a diluent a salivary  fluid passing down through the same pipe which returns the  sugar melted into syrup  Dear readers we have been trying to do something of the  same kind to melt down a modicum from the mass of obser  vations you might possibly consider it a dry one collected by  the curious concerning that not unimportant atom in creation  called a Fly But though our modicum may be but as a drop  of syrup to a whole sugarloaf some of you perchance it may  have already cloyed and to some even have been tinctured  strongly with poppy extract Sugar however as every artist  in that plastic material well knows can be made to assume  every variety of shape and hue so may the sweets of know  ledge be moulded into every form and painted of every colour  and must be to make them palatable Hitherto we have but  melted the unsullied substance drawn from fact presently  we may try to colour it and present you with a painted  sugarplum of fiction wherein the centre the place of the  carraway shall still be occupied by a Fly Meanwhile let us  admonish you that Plies are not all of the same form and  species There are black Plies and bine Plies green Plies  tind particoloured Plies big Plies and little Plies and here  we must notice that the age of young Plies is by no means  like that of young people to be estimated by their size  The Ply is a perfect Insect or Imago having already  passed through its two preparatory stages of transformation  those of Larva and Pupa see vignette corresponding to what  with the Butterfly is more generally known as Caterpillar and  Chrysalis so that like the Butterfly when winged it grows  no more Those middlesized Ply gentry also nearly equal  sized which form the main body of our parlour visitants are  altogether a different species to those of much lesser or greater  magnitude such as some tiny frequenters of flowers the  bouncing Bluebottle and the black and greychequered Blow  Ply those pests preeminent of the larder which as every  cook knoweth are neither   Hatched on the road nor in the stable bred  Numerous gay coloured varieties may be seen between spring  and autumn and in September nearly all together grouped in a  tableau vivant settled and sipping on the honied clusters of  the Michaelmas daisy that last starry heaven of their existence  at all events for the year Later still towards the end of Oc  tober and beginning of November when taking a noonday walk  under a southern ivycrested wall you may be sure to see some  or all of them come out to meet you from their dark green bush  of shelter Even now if yon examine closely between the wall  and the bearded ivy stems which embrace it yon may detect  behind them many a refugee of the revolutionary year and you  may perhaps be rewarded for your trouble by turning out from  the same shelter in lieu of a sleepy Ely a hybernating Butterfly  Startling the eye  With unexpected beauty   Once more to our picture You know we suppose that the  Ely has a pair of wings but a hundred to one if one of you  out of a hundred has ever noticed that she has also a pair of  winglets or little secondary wings and a pair of poisers  drumstick like appendages between the main wings and the  body employed for assisting and steadying her flight These  poisers are much more conspicuous and easily observed without  a magnifier in the Gnat and in the Eather Longlegs insects  belonging to the same order as Elies  Did it ever occur to you to notice the prismatic painting of  a Elys nervous pinion the iridescent colours wherewith its  glassy membrane seems overlaid If not only look we pray  you in a proper light at the next of its kind you may chance  to meet with and if as is most likely it comes to tell you  a pleasant tale of approaching spring time we are verily sure  that you will see a hundred rainbows painted on its wing  That   Great events from little causes spring  is a truth which we have all learnt fifty times over from  book and from experience Pope Adrian the 4th under his  plain English name of Nicholas Breakspear is recorded to  have been choked while drinking by a Ely which says old  Euller in the large territory of St Peters patrimony had no  other place to get into Now since a real Ely stands thus  chronicled in history as having marred the golden fortunes of a  mighty prince surely we may be permitted in romance to make  an imaginary Ely a grand agent in mending the iron luck of an  humble Poet  Our friend H had the misfortune to be cast up a poet  on the stream of Life since in this age of mechanism it  has been turned into a millstream Consequently he found  himself held as a mere bubble in the froth or scum of society  and his residence accorded perfectly with such estimation He  was the highest occupant of a house in a low London neighbour  hood where nevertheless he was looked down upon as a nobody  and no wonder for next beneath him in descending order a  dancing master demonstrated for sixpence a lesson the position  that manners make the man under him albeit above him a  tailor on the first floor exemplified by a flourishing trade that   clothes make the man while a pawnbroker in the shop  below proved beyond a doubt by his golden rule of three that   money makes the man It followed therefore that our  hapless scribbler scant of money scant of clothes and  from an awkward consciousness of such deficiencies by no means  free and easy in his manners was set down by his land  lord the man of money and by his fellow lodgers the man of  catgut and the man of cloth as nothing like a man at all but  a mere bubble as aforesaid in the scum of society  Yet as bubbles even soap bubbles will sometimes rise  heavenwards with a luminous display of rainbow colours so there  were seasons when the spirits of this nonentity would rise from  his skyparlour to the sky above him and return with some  obsolete and childlike notion that God makes the man and  that he had been made in a mould at least as perfect as his  fellows There were moments even when this inflating con  sciousness would come drest in prismatic hues and when the  same nonentity would fondly fancy that the sun of the world  now hidden from his view behind the clouds of friendlessness  and want would one day burst forth upon the bubbles of his  fancy as they ascended balloonlike amidst the applause of  approving thousands  Poor H was a worker in the treadmill of low periodicals  wherein for ever climbing each weary round of the month and  year left him just where he was at the beginning but in spite  of this his daily labour he had taken hours which should have  been of rest for independent composition One poem a  ponderous epic with his name on the titlepage had already  been sent abroad into the world but it had gone forth like its  author unfriended ill drest patron wanting paper and printing  paltry Its reception was accordant if H had thrown a  stone out of his garret window the passing multitude at least  if it had fallen harmless as his poem could only have trodden  on or over it the same Yet was he still sanguine and would  still believe that his neglected work stonelike as he proudly  fancied in solid merit might one day serve for a pedestal  whereon his laurelled statue might be planted But few are  the pedestals formed of a single stone To complete his he  must he thought lay one upon another so lighted to his  labour by the flicker of hopes torch and the flare of tallow  candle he went on working blockhead as he was through  many a fireless winters night at another ponderous block of  literature a second epic poem  Bouglihewn thus in winter he had carved on it in spring  new forms of his creative imagination summer had been  employed on their adornment and with the summers last roses  he had bestowed the last flowery touches on his darling work  It was the afternoon of a sultry first of August magazine  day just over the hireling had got a respite from his daily  drudgery He had employed it on the favourite labour of his  brain but that was ended his epic was actually completed even  to the last word of the last line of the last fair copy which was  about to be exchanged for notes and notice  The poet wiped his pen with an air of complacency then  wiped his thin face threw himself back in his rushbottomed  chair and with halfclosed eyes still bent upon his manuscript  his bulky embodiment of thought indulged in a delicious  reverie Tew sounds from the world without ever reached  the back garret of No Court but from the little world  within itself frequent voices and rumblings from below often  reminded the dweller on its upper surface of vital agencies at  work beneath him Yet on this blessed day of August t every  sound was at rest the dancing master and his class had made  a party to practice the polka on the deck of a Richmond  steamer the tailor had also been tempted to seek the water  and his journeymen taking advantage of his absence had given  the goose a holiday on dry land Tor once all conspired to  encourage the poets daydream when it was suddenly broken  by the unlookedfor entrance of his tea In general our son  of the Muses was compelled to descend himself from his high  Parnassus to the lower regions and invoke the stern Proserpine  there presiding for his share of the boiling Phlegethon but  this day it so happened that in the absence of its betters the  garret was remembered and that at the moment when most it  wished itself forgotten The black kettle was placed on the red  rusted hob a quarter of a pound of salt butter fresh from the  shop was deposited plateless but mind ye not paperless on  the table and then the Proserpine as if the heat had melted  and softened her down into an attendant Hebe proceeded to a  corner cupboard drew forth the tray and teathings placed and  replaced them as if by dint of clatter to reconcile the dis  cordant hues of basin cup and saucer and in process of time  and torment set them on the table Still she lingered perhaps  awaiting recompense of some sort for such surprising works of  supererogation At all events the poet seemed to think so for he  drew from his pocket a shilling we believe it was his last and  put it into the Hebes swarthy hand A curtsey lower than  the back garret had ever witnessed and the recipients speedy  exit were the donors reward Mechanically he proceeded to  make his tea in other words to set afloat a tiny raft in a tepid  ocean then resumed his position and tried also to unravel his  gilded thread of thought but alas it had been snapped  asunder by the lumbering slipshod tread of the workaday witch  his bright visions had all faded before her evil eye and the  silence which her confounded clatter had put to flight was not  to return again for scarcely were his fretted nerves composed  and the creaking stair relieved from her heavy tread when from  some point unseen arose the voice of an abominable Ely Buz  buz buz louder than buz was ever heard before The poet  looked towards the small window of his skyparlour which  libelling the term admitted from where he sat only a view of  sunbaked roofs surmounted by the broad side of a lofty stack  of chimneys and though wide open scarcely a mouthful of the  heated air which air was none But no Fly was there  bouncing against the dim green glass too dim and dusty to  be mistaken even by a Fly for the thin pure ether H  then rose and examined the dark corners of the room with its  cobweb hangings lest perchance some hapless prisoner might  be detained therein but no an attenuated spider her body  wasted like his own by useless toils was their only living  occupant Yet buz buz buz resounded even louder  shriller than before Confound it cried the bewildered poet  and then rushed desperately to the corner cupboard the sole  lurking place left unexplored But what had Flies to do with  empty cupboards with poets larders Buz buz buz  again rose as if in mockery at the very thought He returned  hopeless to his chair perhaps it was fancy after all but  whether bred of fancy or of Fly the sound had sufficed wholly  to demolish the luminous web of thought whose first threads had  been broken by the untimely entrance of his tea To his tea  therefore he applied himself in hopes perhaps that it might  recompose if it failed to reexhilarate The tea or the teapot  did certainly inspire one thought perhaps that tormenting   buz had been only the concluding stanza of the kettles  song Absurd idea the more so in that the kettle had never  sung at all it seldom sings in lodginghouses and on garret  floors it has no heart to sing The tea even flat and vapid as  his mind might have told him so and presently the Flys  voice seemingly silenced rose louder still closer than ever to  repeat buz buz buz that a Fly and nothing else was at  the bottom of the mystery Though in its monotony the very  same yet did that last buz sound in the poets ear as something  different to all those that had gone before they had annoyed  provoked angered him but now the uplifting of that hidden  voice absolutely frightened him To his prostrate spirits just  toppled from their unaccustomed height it almost sounded  ominous of ill That buz buz buz was like the woe woe  woe denounced in her day of doom against the proud  Jerusalem not prouder in stately dome and lofty tower  than of late his airbuilt castles A feeling of sickness came  over him not entirely either from fear of Fly or fear of Fate  but from nothing having passed his lips since the hour of his  scanty breakfast even to the present of seven post meridiem  of the first of August  The Faster fancy fed seemed at last reminded of this fact  and betook himself with what appetite he might to his rigid  loaf his melting butter He cuts a slice he proceeds hear it  Apollo with fingers that have touched thy sacred lyre to unfold  the printed leaf wherein the dissolving condiment lay curtained  But not alone lay that butter in its melting luxury a ravisher  detained in soft imprisonment had been feasting on its charms  and now out he bounces with a buz indeed and buz buz  buz reechoes round as a burly Bluebottle tipsy with love  and jollity mad at escape from thraldom or merry at discovery  bangs up and bounces again and again against the unopened  because unopening half of the garret casement  The mystery is out yet the Poet stands aghast fixed as in  a stupor of horror and dismay He scarcely notices the  escaped offender the buz of Bluebottle now falls unheeded on  his ear the bouncings of Bluebottle attract not his eye for his  eye is strained on more appalling objects on the printed  envelope of rancid butter on the titlepage of his first inde  pendent and avowed production on his own dishonoured name  conspicuous in the transparency of grease This then was the  publicity acquired by his first great work and there torn from  its very self was the sibylline leaf which had told in the warning  buz of that prophetic Ply the coming fate of his second his still  greater work so laboured so exquisitely finished Pinished  it is finished indeed with hope with effort So spoke more  plainly than could words the deep drawn sigh with which poor  H resumed his seat not we may be sure to taste his  illsavoured bread and butter but only to sip his cold tea as  if to swallow down with it something of chagrin or to sip in  something of consolation  It was growing dusk the time of day when poor was accustomed whenever he stole an hour from his toil to  stroll countrywards in the direction of green fields which as  they grew more and more remote he rarely enough contrived  to reach But this evening he had no heart to leave his garret  and not a breath of air came over the heated housetops to  tempt him forth The atmosphere sultry heavy motionless  seemed to press with equal weight upon mind and body  Silence still reigned within the house a silence palpable  painful almost fearful to the sensation of the excited and  exhausted Poet as he sat nervebound to his chair could he  have risen he would have almost started at the creaking of the  crazy floor under his own tread yet he would have given  worlds for a sound to indicate any other living presence besides  his own The scrape of the secondfloor fiddle would for  once have been sweet music in his ear the kitchen Proserpines  ascent with his candle from the shades below would have  been hailed as the presence of an Angel of Light nay the  hateful buz of that detested Ply would now but for its  spectral association with a deed of murder for he had tipped it  in a fit of passion off the brink of the milkpot have sounded  cheerily welcome But the dead stillness remained unbroken  and as if its own pressure combined with the burthen of the  sultry atmosphere were not sufficient to crush the Poets lately  soaring spirit his nerves now conjured up another incubus of  oppression palpable to sight as were the others to ear and  feeling With the sensations of weight overpowering stillness  appalling arose a fanciful augmentation of bulk investing  with magnitude miraculous each dimly discerned object which  lay on the deal table between his eye and the window The  completed manuscript in reality thick enough seemed  swelled into a ponderous tome whose very bulk appeared to  shadow forth its downfall from inherent gravity The fragment  of Cork butter seemed augmented to a mountain from whence  streams were slowly trickling on the dishonoured page that  page now an enormous greaseilluminated scroll printed in  gigantic characters which all who ran might read And in  proportion to the flyleaf the My itself floated a swollen corpse  in a cup large enough to drown its destroyer And see  swollen as he is and hideous that monster My is coming back  to life He struggles to the edge of the lacteal flood lifts  above it his large hairy head made up of dull red eyes stretches  forth his elephantine trunk growing long and long and  longer raises his thin black arms and stands a giant on the  edge of the milky pool Then flapping the drops in a shower  from his dripping pinions he raises a buz deep deafening as  of a thousand buzzes all in one and darting forward pounces  right upon the Poets heaving heart  One day towards the end of the same August whose first  was made as we have just commemorated a big blackletter  day in our Poets calendar he was called on in the midst of  his heaviness to furnish something light just to puff out what  would else have been a slender number of the Milliners  Magazine In the same parlour under much such a heavy sky  before him the same sorry equipage for tea beside him a like  bit of melting butter nothing would have been wanted but  the Ely defunct the flyleaf burned the manuscript burned too  to bring back to its authors mind had it been ever absent that  notable era when his second grand Epic was completed There  he sat like the distressed Poet of the Moral Painter like  him might have plunged for his thought and like him have   found no bottom there only that to save diving he seized  the lightsome object brought vividly to remembrance with all  its heavy associations by the scene the hour and the weather  In short he caught again that villain Ply and committed him  in the following strain once more to paper  THE ELY AND THE POET  Dark were the cares of the Poets breast  Grand were the thoughts of his head  But sad thoughts and grand ones must all be represt  For he had to write nonsense for bread  Proud w r as the curl on the Poets lip  And big w r as the tear in his eye  Scarce he saw in the inkstand his pen to dip  But he saw on its summit a Ely  There Bluebottle sat and stroked down his face  With a twirl of his head twice or thrice  Then says he Brother bard I pity your case   And have brought you a bit of advice   Nay man never wince I heed not your scorn   Tis a fact and Ill presently show it   That if not as you think yourself Poet born   Im by place and by feeding a Poet   I come from a spot where the fruit of the vine   And the oil of the olive abound   Where Arabia and India their riches combine   And shed spiciest of odours around   High over blue mountains with snowy white tips   I wander but use your own eyes   Only look round the shop where you go for your dips   And youll see the Parnassus of Flies   And now for my council thus rich the domain   Whence I draw inspiration and bread   But by lightness not weight I this empire maintain   And by emptiness stand on my head   While others cant climb using infinite pains   I gravity turning to jest   Ascend with all ease perpendicular planes   Rough or smooth just as pleases me best   So try lightness friend Poet I warrant youll find   That as I rule matter so you may rule mind  THE GNAT A LIFE OF BUOYANCY   En toutes saisons danser cest ma vie  There are certain temperaments which hard as iron are only  acted on precisely like that sturdy metal by atmospheric  changes In dull damp weather they gather an additional  coat of rustiness or crustiness while the finest and driest fails  to produce any visible effect upon their aspect or temper  When however one grain of mental mercury enters into their  compound our spirits cannot choose but rise at the exhila  rating influence of a bright winters morning Besides the  effects merely physical of a clear bracing frost the sunshine  of January if it warms us less cheers us more than the  sunshine of June through the force of contrast contrast with  the gloom which has gone before and is sure to come after  contrast with the dark wintry objects on which it shines and  perhaps more than all contrast with that peculiar stillness  which usually attends fair weather at this season a stillness  perceptible both to eye and ear and produced partly by the  quiet of the tuneful groves but quite as much by the absence  of those Insect myriads which animate the summer beam This  very stillness is exciting because our ideas of light and life being  always associate it seems on a bright day strange and almost  unnatural Through a silent sunshine of this description we  repaired yesterday morning to an oak wood which is one of  our favourite places of resort and research This wood till  lately was a sylvan assemblage of most ancient standing but  is now composed almost wholly of comparative upstarts  exulting in their vigorous life over the truncated stumps below  them But even these the monuments of fallen greatness  substantial in decay stood not a whit more motionless than  the slenderest sapling of the living generation not a breath  being abroad to wave their tops or to stir the brown leaves  which had held on laughing at autumn gales and wintry  blasts A sprinkle of snow crisp and glittering slightly  veiled the wood tracks and as we trod them we heard not a  sound but the brittle gems breaking on the spangled path  way This was exactly the stillness we have just been noting  as an addition usually to the effect or mute expression of  old winters face when he treats us to its brightest side but  somehow or another we felt it on the present occasion more  as a feature wanting Our spirits were so light our blood  danced so briskly our heart glowed like our feet so warmly  and rose so thankfully to the Great Source of all things calm  and bright and beautiful that we longed for something ani  mate to join us in our homage of enjoyment The wish was  hardly conceived ere it was accomplished for on passing  beneath a canopy of low interlacing branches we suddenly  found ourselves making one with a company of Gnats dancing  though more mutely quite as merrily as they could possibly  have footed it on the balmy air of a summers eve Their  appearance was welcome to our eyes not as flowers in May  but as flowers in January and so we sat down on one of the  oaken stumps hard by to watch their evolutions Mazy and  intricate enough in sooth they seemed yet these lightwinged  figurantes little as one might think it would seem to have   measure in their mirth aye and mathematics too for it is  stated as a fact that no three of these dancers can so place  themselves that lines joining their point of position shall form  either more or less than two right angles The set upon  which we had intruded was an assemblage of those Tipulidan  or longlegged Gnats which have been named Telltales we  suppose because by their presence in winter they seem to tell  a tale of early spring belied by the bitter east which often  tells us another story when we turn from their sheltered saloon  of assembly In this sense however these are not the only  Telltales of their kind for quite as common at the same  season are some other parties of aerial dancers one of which  we fell in with soon after we had taken leave of the first  These were tiny sylphs with black bodies and wings of snow  white gauze and like choice spirits black white and grey  for they wore plumes of the latter colour they were greeting  the still New Year with mirth and revelry and that over a  frozen pool whose icy presence one would have fancied quite  enough for their instant annihilation But though warmed  by exercise these merry mates care so little for the cold  without they are glad enough when occasion serves to profit  by the shelter of our windows In ours we often watch them  and you good reader had better seek for them unless you  would miss the sight of as pretty and elegant a little creature  as any one could desire to look at on a fine summers much  more a winters day We have spoken of the plumes of these  winged revellers black white and grey which dance in the  air as merrily as the Quakers wife in the song but here be it  observed that our Gnats wives with real quakerlike sobriety  rarely if ever dance at all and never by any accident wear  feathers They may do worse as we shall perhaps discover  byandby but as for plumes in poetic parlance feathered  antlers in scientific pectinate antenna these are decorations of vanity exclusively confined among all Gnats to the  masculine gender Gnats balls therefore contrary to usual  custom are made up of beaux   T is merry in tine hall when beards wag all  says a morose proverb steeped in the boozing barbarism of  days gone by and these ungallant Flies would seem still to  think it merry in the air when their dames are not there  Apropos of dancing we may here mention one peculiar mode  of Gnat practice which came the other day under our observation It may have been remarked before or it may not at  all events our note is in season and will serve if for nothing  else to illustrate the assertion that a habit of noticing Insect  movements may often amuse a stray minute which might  otherwise be wholly lost in vacancy Well one of these  sportive gentry having made itself free of our parlour  presently deserted the window and came to suspend itself in  air directly over the cage of our favourite canary which was  placed on a table near the fire Here with incredible activity  and perseverance the Insect kept up its pas dextase alternately rising and falling for more than half an hour without  intermission never deviating from its position over the little  musicians head but evidently coming lower so as almost to  touch the top of the cage whenever the bird renewed its  occasionally broken song The attraction of the latter was  unquestionable its cause dubious also whether of an indivi  dual or general character If general may it not be that by  a sort of pleasure derived from the notes or other alluring  influence exercised by singingbirds these Gnats by nature  the prey of so many are attracted to approach and hover  within reach of their syren enemies   When the sun shines let foolish Gnats make sport  But creep in crannies when he hides his beams  now this is an allusion in which our Bard of Avon fails to  display his usual most accurate observation of natural objects  Though courting the winter gleam every body can tell that  Gnats by no means hide their heads with the summer sun for  they seem to rejoice at his setting as much as at his rising in  his absence as well as in his presence In short at every hour  as at every season Bansez toujours seems their motto up  and down in and out and round about in the morning noon  and evening of our day as in the morning noon and evening  of their own existence  But stay here we are arrived at the end of our dance nay  at the end of our dancers lives without having said a word  about their beginning Well we have nothing for it but to  go backwards jumping over the steps already made up to the  premier pas our aerial performers birth and parentage Even  this though will hardly do since for the sake of the unin formed it may be well to preface our memoir by a word or  two on the subject of Insect Transformation Everybody we  conclude has a general notion concerning the passage of a  Butterfly through the successive stages of caterpillar chrysalis  and winged flatterer Then only let it be borne in mind  that all perfect Insects have passed through three states cor  responding though not similar which are yclept by Entomo  logists those of Larva Pupa and Imago  Now for the beginning of the Gnats life of Buoyancy  which commences on the water Man has been believed by  the nations of antiquity to have  Learned of the little Nautilus to sail  Spread the thin oar and catch the rising gale  but he might also have taken a first lesson in boatbuilding  from an object common in almost every pond though certainly  not so likely to attract attention as the sailing craft of that  bold mariner the little Argonaut This object is a boat of  eggs not a boat eggladen nor yet that witchs transport an  eggshell boat but a buoyant lifeboat curiously constructed  of her own eggs by the common Gnat How she begins and  completes her work may be seen by any one curious enough  and wakeful enough to repair by five or six in the morning to  a pond or bucket of water frequented by Gnats and those  who would rather see through other eyes than their own  especially when perhaps half open may read in the pages of  Reaumur or Rennie t full descriptions of this mother boat  builders clever operations The boat itself with all we are  going to describe and all we have depicted from the life  may be seen at home and at all hours within the convenient  compass of a basin filled from an adjacent pond When  complete the boat consists of from 250 to 350 eggs of which  though each is heavy enough to sink in water the whole com  pose a structure perfectly buoyant so buoyant as to float  amidst the most violent agitation What is yet more wonderful  though hollow it never fills with water and even if we push it  to the bottom of our mimic pool it will rise unwetted to the  surface This cunning craft has been likened to a London  wherry being sharp and high fore and aft convex below  concave above and always floating on its keel In a few days  each of the numerous lives within having put on the shape  of a grub or Larva issues from the lower end of its own flask  shaped egg but the empty shells continuing still attached the  boat remains a boat till reduced by weather to a wreck  Here let us leave it and follow the fortunes of one of the crew  after he has left his cabin which he quits in rather a singular  manner emerging through its bottom into the water Happily  however he is born a swimmer and can take his pleasure in  his native element poising himself near its surface head down  wards tail upwards Why chooses he this strange position  Just for the same reason that we rather prefer when taking a  dabble in the waves to have our heads above water for the  convenience namely of receiving a due supply of air which  the little swimmer in question sucks in through a sort of tube  in his tail This breathing apparatus as well as the tail itself  serves also for a buoy and both end in a sort of funnel com  posed of hairs arranged in a starlike form and anointed with  an oil by which they repel water When tired of suspension  near the surface our little swimmer has only to fold up these  divergent hairs and plump he sinks down to the bottom He  goes however provided with the means of reascension a  globule of air which the oil enables him to retain at his funnels  ends on reopening which he again rises whenever the fancy  takes him But yet a little while and a new era arrives in  the existence of this buoyant creature buoyant in his first  stage of Larva in his second of Pupa he is buoyant still  Yet in resemblance how unlike But lately topsyturvy his  altered body first assumes what we should call its natural  position and he swims head upwards because within it there  is now contained a different but equally curious apparatus for  inhaling the atmospheric fluid Seated behind his head arises  a pair of respirators not very much unlike the aural appendages  of an ass to which they have been compared and through these  he feeds on air requiring now no grosser aliment At his  nether extremity there expands a fishlike finny tail by help of  which he can either float or strike at pleasure through the  water  Thus passes with our buoyant Pupa the space of about a  week and then another and a more important change comes   oer the spirit of his dream With the gradual development  of superior organs the little spark of sensitivity within seems  wakened to a new desire to rise upwards Bed for a season upon  air the insects desires seem to have grown aerian While a  noonday snn is warm upon the water as yet his native element  he rises to the surface and above it elevating both head and  shoulders as if gasping for the new enjoyments which await  him His breast swells as it were with the sweet antici  pation his confining corslet bursts and the head not that  which has played its part on the stage of being now about to  close but another all plumed and decorated for a more  brilliant theatre emerges through the rent followed by the  shoulders and the filmy wings which are to play upon the  air But have a care my little debutant thou art yet  upon the water an unlucky somerset would wet thy still soft  and drooping pinions and render them unfit for flight Now  is thy critical moment hold thee steady lose not thy per  pendicular or But why fear we for the little mariner  He who clothes the lily and feeds the sparrow has provided  him support in this his point of peril The stiff covering of  his recent form from which he is struggling to escape now  serves him as a lifeboat the second to which he will owe  liis safety His upright body forms its mast as well as sail  and in the breeze now rippling the water he is wafted rapidly  along He will assuredly be capsized from press of sail But  see he has acquired by this time other helps to aid his self  preserving efforts His slender legs hitherto hung pendant  now feel for and find the surface of the pool His boat is left  behind and still endowed with one aquatic power he stands a  moment on the water then rises buoyant a winged inhabitant  of air  So now we have brought our bold sailor into port and re  transformed him into a bolder aeronaut His performances in  the latter character as a dancer we have extolled already but  others of a graver nature for which he has the discredit still  remain for notice Yet think not gentle ladies that our  plumed Gnat gallant albeit so ungallant to his own fair one  ever settles on a sunny cheek or ever enters at door or window  with bloodthirsty intent Spare him therefore if not pour  V amour de ses beaux plumes at least for the sake of the  innocence they denote Let him finish his reel or his horn  pipe unmolested and reserve your vengeance for his shrewish  partner on whose plumeless head it will more justly fall Have  we not already hinted that though she seldom dances and  never wears feathers she has practices something worse and  she it is who while her spouse regales himself on nectar  quaffed from flowers or perhaps even is satisfied with a cha  meleon banquet she it is who longs for the red wine  each drop of which she repays with poison Hers are the   barbed shaft the whirring wings the dragon scales  against which you must invoke the protection of your guar  dian sylph or your pocket handkerchief But even in their  fiercest shape or in that most formidable a mingled swarm in  which the guilty and the guiltless in their company must as  in other cases alike bear the buffet we are seldom ourselves  inclined to visit Gnat offenders very roughly Even at the risk  of being taken for cousins once removed of the old lady whose  partiality for Fleas stands recorded we must confess to a  sneaking kindness for Gnats be they plumed or plumeless  honeysippers or bloodsuckers Not only at this season but  always we love their shrilly hum because it comes associate if  with one painful with many pleasant experiences and pleasant  memories such as of summer sunsets warm windowseats  and above all of such bright winter noondays as that on  which we yesterday attended their assembly beneath the   brown wood tree But of course we can plead only for  the Gnats of England not even for these in her countries of  morass and fen and only with Englands stay at home  daughters As for those who in colonial climates seek  matrimony and find Mosquitos who could attempt to propi  tiate their wounded sensibilities There where tropic suns  soften the heart of man and woman loves to stamp her image  on its wax like impressibility to retire to sleep a Yenus and  wake a Medusa a foul thing of bumps and blotches who  can wonder that under such a visitation the gentlest of bosoms  should swell with wrath and vengeance and who would dare  to deprecate the Nerolike desire that Mosquitos Gnats in all  their varieties and in all their countless myriads possessed but  one common body to be crushed to atoms beneath the sufferers  stamping foot  The following lively lines from the pen of that poet of  Nature the American Bryant cannot be deemed foreign to the  subject of these his native Gnats and they are moreover  suggestive to the ladies at home as well as abroad of a new  use to which they might apply the cosmetic mask of Bowland  manufacture That celebrated conservator of female charms  might do well to reprint them himself in form of an adver  tisement  TO A MOSQUITO  Fair Insect that with threadlike legs spread out  And bloodextracting bill and filmy wing  Dost murmur as thou slowly sailst about  In pitiless ears full many a plaintive thing  And tell how little our large veins should bleed  Would we but yield them to thy bitter need  Unwillingly I own and what is worse  Full angrily men hearken to thy plaint  Thou gettest many a brush and many a curse  For saying thou art gaunt and starved and faint  Een the old beggar while he asks for food  Would kill thee hapless stranger if he could  I call thee stranger for the Town I ween  Has not the honour of so proud a birth  Thou comst from Jersey meadows fresh and green  The offspring of the Gods tho born on earth  For Titan was thy sire and fair was she  The Ocean Nymph that nursed thy infancy  Beneath the rushes was thy cradle swung  And when at length thy gauzy wings grew strong  Abroad to gentle airs their folds were flung  Rose in the sky and bore thee soft along  The South wind breathed to waft thee on thy way  And danced and shone beneath the billowy bay  And calm afar the city spires arose  Thence didst thou hear the distant hum of men  And as its grateful odours met thy nose  Didst seem to smell thy native marsh again  Fair lay its crowded streets and at the sight  Thy tiny song grew shriller with delight  At length thy pinions fluttered in Broadway  Ah there were fairy steps and white necks kissed  By wanton airs and eyes whose killing ray  Shone through the snowy veils like stars thro mist  And fresh as morn on many a cheek and chin  Bloomd the bright blood thro the transparent skin  Oh these were sights to touch an anchorite  What do I hear thy slender voice complain  Thou wailest when I talk of Beautys light  As if it brought the memory of pain  Thou art a wayward being well come near  And pour thy tale of sorrow in my ear  What sayest thou slanderer rouge makes thee sick  And China Bloom at best is sorry food  And Rowlands Kalydor if laid on thick  Poisons the thirsty wretch that bores for blood  Got was a just reward that met thy crime  But shun the sacrilege another time  That bloom was made to look at not to touch  To worship not approach that radiant white  And well might sudden vengeance light on such  As dared like thee most impiously to bite  Thou shouldst have gazed at distance and admired  Murmured thy adoration and retired  We have spoken of Gnats and Mosquitos almost as one  because to ordinary observers there is very little exterior  difference between them though as naturalists have reckoned  near thirty species of the Culex or Gnat family in Britain alone  the pest of the Tropics and the Poles is no doubt a variety  And verily if these perpetual plagues in the air were the sole  evils attendant on fierce extremes of climate we should have  ample cause to bless our stars or rather bless our sun in  whose tempered beams our Mosquitos are but as harmless  motes compared with sparks of living fire Sparks of fire  what say we Sparks of fire nay showers of fireballs could  shew respect to the Great Washingtons boots yet are we told  that the General of freedom was pierced through his calfs skin  even to his calves by tyrant Mosquitos and that Italian  bloodsuckers of the shores of the Po great and terrible as  their western brethren can also plunge their stilettos through  a shield of leather backed by a defence of triple hose Well  might legionary demons armed like these have routed a Persian  army well might lions flee before them well might they  bequeath their conquering name Mosquito to country bay  and town in that quarter of the globe where chiefly they  usurp dominion and in another Polewards well may the Lap  land peasant encase himself in a cloud of smoke and the  Crimean soldier in his sack as a protection from envenomed  weapons thick as descending snowflakes and keen as the  cutting frost of their native winters These polar demons seem  endued too with almost demoniac vitality for northern  travellers record how that when frozen into black masses  resembling peat they have been thawed into a living cloud  It is really pleasant to turn from these foreign flagellators  of humanity here only noticed for the sake of contrast to our  gentler sporters in the sun and shade with a few of whose  varieties and vagaries we shall bid them for the present farewell  All those who are accustomed to make their ablutions in soft  water have probably noticed at the bottom of their ewers an  assemblage of dirtcoloured fuzzy streaks which on narrowly  watching they would find to be endued with the power of loco  motion Each of these objects as it meets the sight is nothing  but a case of dusty particles collected around it by a little  living occupant which on account of its colour has acquired  the sanguinary name of Bloodworm An eye unacquainted  with this unpromising object would as little expect to behold  evolved from it a creature of grace and beauty as to see a rose  expand from the stalk of a nettle yet after passing through the  intermediate stage of Pupa in which its breathing organs are  no less curiously adapted than those of the common species  this little worm emerges from the water in the shape of a small  Gnat whose elegant plumes surpassing those of its fellows  have acquired for it the accordant appellation of Chironimus  plumosus Some varieties of this pretty Ely waltz upon the  water or glide over its surface like the stately swan their  wings as with the bird serving them for the purpose of a sail  All Gnats however are not aquatic in their birth and early  stages one little orangecoloured species instead of awaking  into life surrounded by a liquid expanse finds itself within the  narrow bounds of a single wheat blossom the pollen of which  thanks to a careful mother provides for all its infant  necessities Mighty in their multitude a swarm of tiny feeders  such as these is said sometimes to destroy a crop of wheat  Such or in shapes but slightly varied is the Gnats existence  generally throughout its stages always in its perfect form  one of cheerful buoyancy We might do worse than take  pattern by its character To joy in every season of our fives  in sunshine and in shade to let the drops of affliction glide  from off our elastic spirits as the falling raindrops glide from  off the oily wings and agile bodies of the showerheedless in  sect this were indeed no bad philosophy but is it practised  rarely enough we fancy and with a sigh have reason to  admit Is it practicable P to a great extent we believe it is  either through the lightness of animal spirits or much better  through the resisting power of the moralmachinery within  us when obedient to that grand moving wheel which the  holy oil of divine aid and divine blessing ever keeps in play  Looking into real fife for an instance of a buoyant nature  the season helps to remind us would we could quote him as a  living example of Thomas Hood that mirthful son of genius  who under failing health and great cause for depressing care  could yet be harmlessly jocund all the year round while he  provided for so many of us now his mourners a rich banquet of  animal mirth A German philosopher has said that happiness  and misfortune stand in continual balance This is a cheering  reflection and more it is a fact continually brought home to  our individual experience by the reacfion of mental depression  and the lively inspirations of hope  Let us then with our Insect model strive to keep up our  buoyancy but let us beware of confounding levity with elas  ticity of mistaking the glare of worldly pleasure for the  sunshine of a cheerful heart Herein also does our little winged  philosopher furnish us with a warning as well as an example  He takes delight in his native atmosphere in sunshine or in rain  he is neither drowned by the one nor scorched by the other  But how often when he enters the precincts of artificial life is  he tempted to approach the alluring taper until drawn within  its fiery vortex his little life of buoyancy is on a sudden changed  to one of torture  THE WOODANT AND THE APHIDES   Povert a spectacle is as thiuketh me  Through which he may his very Frendis see Chaucer  In the midst of an oak wood stands a village or scattered  group of rustic habitations These are curiously excavated in  the earth above which rise their domelike roofs thatched in  a peculiar manner with pieces of stick and straw and each  is the common abode of a large community of various ranks  and orders In one of these sylvan dwellings there lived  and perhaps lives still a good sort of body a female member  of the working class who set a perfect pattern of industry  though to do them justice all her neighbours and fellow  lodgers those at least of the same rank were shaped in like  fashion and out of the same useful stuff as herself She was  not only indefatigable in the feminine cares of nursing and atten  dance on the young and weakly but was also an adept in various  toilsome occupations such as building digging and foraging  labours always performed by herself and sisterhood after the  custom of some remote countries called barbarous as well as  more or less of certain others much nearer home which are  miscalled civilized To all her laudable activity it might have  been naturally expected that our useful busybody would have  added a portion of such prudent forethought as would have  secured to herself a certain provision against the approach of  winter a season which interrupted her labours and nearly cut  off her supplies but no such thing the most heedless lover of  pleasure that ever tripped it in a ballroom or fluttered from  flower to flower could not possibly have taken less thought  for the morrow than our toiling villager Often at work not  only from morn till eve but from eve till dewy morn she had  turned as it were the summer into one long day and seemed  to think that she had thereby acquired a title to convert the  winter or as much of it as she chose into one long night  At all events both she and her fellowlabourers had earned the  right of which they were never defrauded of being as warmly  lodged during the inclement season as their betters those  at least for whom they had been toiling and whose habitation  they shared as well as built Accordingly when December  arrived and with it a frost of intense severity our busybody  shut herself up in her warm underground quarters and having  no doubt taken first a complacent review of her wellspent  summer day fell into a comfortable dose and from thence into  a slumber profound as that fabled of the Seven Sleepers So  deep and long her nap that the merry Christmas bells did not  wake her nor yet the shouts of merrier children when they  came trampling and jumping over head to gather the scarlet  holly berries which abound near her habitation On went  the frost and with it on went the good housewifes com  fortable snooze but one day the sharp northeast having  whistled his own lullaby his brother the soft southwest arose  to do duty in his stead The sun at the same time drew aside  his fog curtain and shone out so bright and warm as to pene  trate even to our sleepers underground chamber She felt its  reviving power and with a yawn and a stretch which if com  mensurate with the duration of her slumbers must have been  of tremendous length she rubbed her eyes and awoke Like  the sluggard however though sluggard she was none she  turned and tried to sleep again but it would not do certain  uneasy sensations not very difficult to account for after a six  weeks abstinence soon drove away all her drowsiness She  would certainly have arisen and have gone to her cupboard  only that with her the comforts and consolations of a corner  cupboard were mysteries unknown Nevertheless awake up  she did and looked round upon her friends the companions  of her slumber but not as yet of her wakefulness and she  was too kind to rouse them knowing she should thereby only  bring them into the same strait of hunger as herself How to  get out of it she hardly knew but instead of sitting or lying  down again to consider she stept up to the entrance of her  dwelling or we should rather say one of them since it had  almost as many as the farfamed residence of John o Groat  These however had been according to custom all carefully  barred up on the setting in of the frost so that all alone she  had to take down one of the barricades she had assisted to  erect and this done though not without some effort she was  able to take a peep at the outward world from which she had  been so long retired And a beautiful world it was all dressed  in white and begemmed with diamonds sparkling in the noon  day sun as they fell from the boughs faster than leaves in  autumn Strange as it may seem our sleeper awakened had  never in all her life seen it so dressed out before and if she  had not been rather cold and very hungry she might perhaps  have stood lost in admiration at the fine dissolving views  around her yet perhaps not either for she had always a  better eye for business than for the picturesque Besides she  had been thinking of what to do and in so doing had be  thought her of a certain large family with whom her own had  long been upon the most intimate and social footing and by  whom indeed both herself and friends had often been regaled  even when they had gone in a large party to claim hospitality  It would have seemed hard indeed had such hospitality been  ever grudged by these their neighbours to one or any among  the inhabitants of our village in the wood for often under  their strawthatched roofs had the children of the former been  tenderly fostered even from their birth a kind office in which  you may be sure our good little body had not been backward  to assist Some folks however are always groping for the  worm of selfishness at the roots of all good actions except  their own and these whispered with delight that it was not  for nothing that our busy people occupied themselves with  other peoples children Be this as it may our sleeper  awakened resolved in her hour of need to ask the assistance  of those who certainly on the face of the matter owed some  obligations to her and hers but the question now was how  to reach their abode which was seated under the protection of  an old oak pollard at some distance from her own In  summer nothing could be easier and novice as she was in  winter travelling she thought poor little soul deceived by  appearances that she should find it mighty pleasant and clean  walking over the snow And so a few hours before she might  for she was always a very lightsome body and after a six  weeks nap she had not as we may readily suppose an atom of  heaviness remaining but now the snow being half melted by  the sun she sank and floundered at every step besides being  ever and anon nearly swept away by tremendous avalanches  falling from the laden boughs over head Pushed on  however by hunger and her own determined spirit and  assisted by that Kind Power which as shewn both in the Fable  book and the book of Life seldom fails to help those who are  inclined to help themselves she arrived at length within  sight of the desired oak tree A few minutes more brought  her under its boughs and into the very midst of the family  she had come to visit Like her they had all been brought  out by the sunshine and like her had all been sleeping through  the frost a habit in which they exactly resembled our busy  friend and her fellows but here all likeness ended the people  of the oak being as lazy a crew as ever slept or ate away  existence They were in short of the number of those spoilt  children of mother earth of all the least enviable on whom  she lavishes her gifts without requiring any labour in return  for these idlers wherever their abode always found themselves  in the midst of plenty Idlers as they were yet after their  late long fast you may be sure they were all busy enough in  breaking it and as their famishing visitor drew near her  hungry eyes were not slow in discerning that young and old  big and little were hard at work not with their knives and  forks but with their pipes which both their food and their  manner of eating it being like those of the Chinese rather  peculiar served them instead of either Not one of the party  took the slightest notice of the pitiful presence of our poor  dripping wearied traveller as she stood at an humble distance  and looked round timidly before she ventured except by looks  to make known her wants She first tried to recognise among  the younger of the party some who might have been her foster  children but they were all grown out of knowledge at all  events seemed to have no knowledge of her From the juveniles  she then turned to one who judging by appearance might have  been le Pere de la Famille browncoated round sleek and  shining he had been busiest of the busy with his pipe which  by the way was much longer and as his petitioner soon found  much more pliant than himself Fairly tired out with its use  he had laid this curious instrument of repletion not aside for  he was too much attached to it but out of the way and now  depending from his chin and bent over his portly stomach it  passed between his legs and turned up like a tail behind  Well this was the onetailed Bashaw whom our hungry sup  pliant at length ventured to accost though why in preference  to others we cannot say unless it might have been from the  unoccupied consequence of his air She related her pressing  need a tale which her gaunt figure and famished looks told  for her over again but twice told or told a hundred times it  fell as is usual with tales of like burthen upon a heedless ear  The little plump browncoated gentleman coolly brought for  ward his pipe and under the starvelings very nose began  again not I promise you to puff out mere whiffs of smoke  but to draw in after his peculiar fashion the remainder of his  unfinished and apparently interminable repast This was very  hardhearted to be sure but then in his defence be it ob  served that his suppliant was on her part no less thickheaded  having thought poor silly creature to strengthen her claim by  a delicate allusion to former kindnesses received at her hands  by certain of his kindred For this her folly she was only  treated as she deserved perhaps she thought so too for without  applying to any one else of all her many friends whose  looks were not encouraging she turned away hungrier and  sadder than ever meaning to try and crawl back again to her  unprovisioned home that she might die at least among her own  people But alas she soon found that this backward step  hard enough to contemplate was one yet harder to execute  While her friends had been busy feasting with their hollow  pipes and she with her hollow eyes the sun had been busy  with the snow of which by this time he had made what to  her was an impassable lake between herself and home How  wistfully did she try but in vain to look across it from that  barbarous and inhospitable shore where she must now lie down  and perish with hunger But no a death more speedy soon  threatened to swallow up the atom that now remained of our  poor little villagers wasted body The great sun having  stooped from his meridian height to do her all the harm  he could had now shrunk behind a dark cloudy screen  whence presently and as if he was still at the bottom of the  mischief there came pouring down a tremendous torrent The  intercepting lake soon spread into a sea the sea soon swelled  into an ocean and the wind no longer a soft southwester  rippled it into mimic waves with the power of which our  hapless wayfarer soon found herself weakly battling Who  then would have given a straws end for her little life not  one I trow of the best friends she had in all her little world  Yet a friend of the helpless better than all dw provide a  straw to which she was able to cling in her dire extremity  On this same straw or stick or spar it matters not what but  on a something large enough and light enough to supply her  with a raft she floated about now here now there till at last  she was carried where do you think back again to the  foot of the old oak pollard inhabited by her fair weather  friends There the subsiding waters left her and as soon as a  little recovered our tempesttossed traveller looked around for  some member of the inhospitable family but they were all  retired to their inner chamber from whence she could discover  nothing of their presence except here and there a sharp little  black eye peering out at her from behind a convenient crevice  She hardly knew indeed why she looked after them at all  every thought of begging was at an end All her wants as she  believed were ended too but feeling very cold and benumbed  she crept by a prodigious effort which seemed her last into a  cranny near the bottom of the old pollard which hollow as it  was had a great deal more heart for her than its churlish  occupants The short winters day was nearly at a close and  our little busybody all her business seeming at an end still  lay within her place of refuge Perishing with hunger cold  and wet bitter seemed her end and very bitter one might  have supposed her thoughts against the many friends  who with power and close at hand were letting her die all  unheeded and alone But somehow it often happens that  when our troubles seem to others at their very sharpest we  find that to ourselves their edge is already blunted So at  least it was with the troubles and with the anger too if any  she had ever felt of our sleeper awakened Sleep himself  that kind restorer from whose embraces she had broken only  to encounter a world of woe had once more lifted her into his  arms and was going to transfer her gently to those of his   brother Death In plain parlance she had fallen into a nap  which promised to be much longer even than her last when she  was suddenly awoke by a gentle tapping on the outside of her  hollow oak tree On opening her eyes she could just discern  by the light of the setting sun not a Woodpecker who  would have been to her of all visitants the most unwelcome  but the young face of one belonging to the numerous family  all of whom she had reason to believe alike hardhearted  This little creature had heard and pitied the story of her  distress when she thought she had related it to none but dull  cold ears and hers too were among the prying eyes which  had noticed the suppliants unpurposed return Now that  her elders were again busy with their pipes having none other  occupation the kindhearted soul had crept round to the  hiding place of their uninvited guest to offer her her own  supper The poor destitute thankfully received what was so  kindly proffered and was wonderfully refreshed by the timely  aid She slept that night in the old tree and the next day  all the water having disappeared contrived to reach her home  but her friend in need had taken care to supply her before  hand with a good breakfast and would not suffer her to depart  without a store of honey to refresh her on the road The  gift was not however applied to this purpose by our good  villager The unkindness of the many could not freeze her  heart while there was the kindness of one to keep it warm  and it was with all and more than all her usual delight that  she imparted of her hardwon treasure to her poor fellow  labourers whom she had never thought to see again By the  time she returned they had nearly all awoke from their common  slumber but a few only were at home to welcome her the  rest having gone out early to forage for provisions and where  should they have gone but to the oak pollard and the people  of the pipes From these and above all from the little brown  coated gentleman who wore his pipe en queue they met with  infinite civility and with what they wanted more a plentiful  supply After the shabby treatment of their sister in need  this might seem somewhat marvellous but then she had gone  alone and as a suppliant with nothing but past services to  cover her effrontery they had gone in a body and solicited  supplies in a tone authorized by numbers and by the right  of custom  So ends our tale but we have yet to disclose the name of  that industrious goodnatured yet withal improvident and  rather simple little personage whose adventure it records  There is a certain busy worker of whom it is declared that  she provideth her meat in the summer and gathereth her  food in the harvest for which sagacious proceeding all  teachers of morality from the wise monarch of Israel down  wards have held her up as a bright pattern of industrious  forethought Everybody knows everybody at least supposes  that this farseeing animal is as represented none other than  the prudent Ant Now our little worker who hard as she  toiled in summer days took no care for wintry morrows  displayed no forethought at all the provident Ant therefore  she could not be In conjunction with her prudence in parti  cular exemplified by her supposed harvesting of a store for  future want the prudence in general of the abovenamed  Insect has been no less highly lauded but of prudence our  simple villager knew nothing nothing at least of that Image  of the Yirtue called after her and set up a cold statue in  Mam mo As temple Her labours were all for the general profit  not for her own individual benefit the prudent Ant she could  never be  It has also been observed sarcastically and with reference to  the same acknowledged prudence that   La Fourmi nest pas preteuse  Cest la son moindre defaut  whereas the individual of our story shewed herself something  more than pretense not only willing to lend her labour but  ready to impart of all she had her little hard won store to  her neighbours and fellowworkers The avaricious Ant she  could never be An Ant nevertheless and nothing else is  intended to be represented by our sleeper awakened of the  strawroofed dwelling only that her portrait is not painted  after the old masters or their modern copyists whose pictures  with the exception of one grand feature that of industry are  totally unlike those drawn from the life by close observers  The policy of Eastern Ants may possibly reach farther than  that of European and whatever they did in the days of Solomon  they certainly do still Perhaps even wheresoever the Ant  Tribes may be scattered among the Tribes of Israel they may  have learnt from the prudent people with whom they dwell  always to forecast and never to lend without good interest  This might furnish a point of enquiry for Physiologists of  Insect Mind but our business is with Ants in general of  whom it is commonly supposed that they have storehouse and  barn for winter provender and of whom it has been further  fabled that they know how to keep their corn in due order by  cleverly biting off the germinating end Now though they  are acquainted with practices quite as cunning even as this  it would seem after all that the mystery of harvesting is to  them unknown Now and then indeed we may see one of these  indefatigable workers alone or assisted by a comrade toiling  under the prodigious burthen of a wheat or barleycorn but  this it would appear is employed for building rather than for  food a few scattered grains being often mingled with the bits  of stick and straw used by the Wood Ants to thatch or cover  in their conical abodes Our busy villager represents a member  of one of these sylvan communities and we have considered  her of the feminine gender not merely to compliment the  sex on their common virtues of industry and of generous  unselfish kindness nor yet to censure them for their as  common want of thought or prospective calculation but  simply because all Ant labourers are females though distin  guished from those which become the wives and mothers of  the community Go then to the Ant ye spinsters con  sider her ways and be wise See how in her state of  single blessedness she makes herself by active uses one of  the greatest blessings of her own society and be the same of  yours  And now for the way in which these Ant communities pass  the winter and for the neighbours to whom they are accus  tomed to apply in time of need These have been already  glanced at under the guise of fable In the plain garb of  corresponding fact let us look at them a little more closely as  their doings stand recorded in some right pleasant and vera  cious chronicles of the Pormic Nations Ants says their  historian usually become torpid during the intense cold but  when the season is not severe the depth of their nest guards  them from the effects of frost They do not lose their activity  unless the temperature be reduced to the 2nd degree of  Reaumur below freezing point I have occasionally seen them  walking upon the snow engaged in their customary avocations  In so reduced a temperature they would be exposed to the  horrors of famine were they not supplied with food by the  Pucerons The Pucerons we must here observe are none  other than those little Insects usually green found in more  or less abundance on every plant and tree and commonly  known under the misleading names of Blight and Honey  Dew they are also called Aphides and Plantluce The  entire history of these little animals is very curious but of this  ill due season Suffice it now that one of its most curious  chapters relates to their remarkable connexion with Ants to  whom they are in the habit when called on of imparting  refreshment in the shape of that sweet juice called Honey Dew  with which their own bodies are amply filled Our author  continues By an admirable concurrence of circumstances  which we cannot attribute to accident these Insects become  torpid at exactly the same degree of cold as those to which  they are thus useful and recover from this state also at the  same time so that the Ants always find them when they need  them We see from this that the absence in Ants of that  faculty which would guide them to lay up a winter store is no  defect in their nature The providing instinct is not bestowed  whilst a provision is given to supply its place  When we say the providing instinct is not given we must  however limit the observation to the business of storing grain  for winters want Though they do not this they sometimes  do as much or more What say you to the habit of keeping  and tending infant herds with a view to future use At all  events through a prospective propensity which is made sub  servient to this end they will sometimes says Huber  collect the eggs of Aphides deposit them in their own nests  guard them with the greatest care till evolved and then as we  pasture milch kine continue to keep an eye over them for the  delicious nutriment they afford Those Ants which do not  know how thus to assemble them are at least acquainted  with their resorts They follow them to the base of the trees  and branches of the shrubs they are used to frequent and at  the beginning of frost pursue along the hedges the paths  which lead to their retreat As soon as the Ants recover from  their torpor induced by severe cold they venture forth to  procure their food The honied aliment thus collected and  swallowed is on their return home equally distributed among  their companions The Ant figured in our story and pre  figured in our vignette is one of that large species before  spoken of popularly known by the different names of Pismire  Wood Hill and Horse Ant Their stick and strawcapped  cones scattered through the woods must be familiar to all  woodland walkers Without a mound of confusion within  they are a marvel of arrangement The conical coping which  presents itself to our eye as the roof of one of these sylvan  habitations is indeed the roof but may also be considered as  the upper story or perhaps several which contain within them  various chambers one in the centre larger and loftier than the  rest with passages of communication besides others which  lead to the exterior of the nest The outer entrances of these  various avenues at other times open are carefully barricaded  not only in winter but in rainy weather and also of a night  To construct fabrics like these or any fabrics at all out of  such materials as straw sticks grains and other miscellaneous  substances all dry light and unadhesive would seem a  wonder would be in fact an utter impossibility but for the  mortar employed also by our rustic builders This is composed  of earth that chiefly thrown out in hollowing the ground for  the foundation of their edifice which tempered with rainwater  and mingled with the substances above mentioned render  them capable of sufficient compaction to maintain their places  and resist weather  Beside and beneath these upper chambers the attics we  may call them of the Woodants dwelling it contains exca  vated within the ground another set of apartments with  convenient passages to which the inhabitants all retire on  the appearance of winter therein to slumber with more or less  pertinacity according to the severity or mildness of the season  The habitations of Ants are of different construction ac  cording tp the species of their builders some being raised like  that above described and formed masonlike of earth while  others are mined beneath its surface or excavated in wood  All are difficult to follow in their progress towards completion  Huber found it so even with the assistance of artificial Formi  caries but the labours of our Woodants are more open to  observation as they work less under cover than the more  regular Masons Miners and Carpenters of their  indefatigable race  Our villagers many friends of the old pollard are  intended expressly though not with reference to character for  a family of the large brown Oak Aphis greatest of its tribe  with a pipe or sucker of prodigious length which when not  employed in extraction of sweet juices from leaf and branch is  carried under the body passing upwards like a tail  LIFE IN DEATH   Life mocks the idle hate  Of his archenemy Death  We were loath to begin the year by contemplation of our  Insect subjects while buried in a sleep wearing Deaths perfect  semblance but we can look at them now and their dreamless  slumber inspires no corresponding dulness but only curious ex  pectancy for they are about to awake and soon their songs of  life and liberty their morning hymn and their evening boom  will be resounding over the bursting hedgerows and the  opening flowers The Bee is still mute the Beetle still  motionless the Butterfly like the bud still enfolded in its  protecting shroud but they are not the less existent and to  discover where and how is a curious object of pursuit and  eke a cheerful one shewing how life and pleasure activity  and beauty lie lurking under a thousand dry and deathlike  forms to which they owe their preservation  With our Cricketlike propensities it is not for nothing we  can tell you that we are tempted from our cheerful hearth on  this side of April but in hunting after hidden life do we not  still pursue our favourite element What seek we still through  frost and snow and torpor but sparks of vital fire emanating  all from the Great Source of heat and light of love and  wisdom and ready to be kindled at His bidding by the re  turning sun at once His servant and His image With intent  of discovering life thus hidden under seeming death we were  out yesterday seeking after Moths and Butterflies or more  properly after what will become such in due season but con  sidering as we shall further illustrate byandby that all the  changes of these Insects are only a series of developments we  may look upon our search and for noveltys sake so call it as a  Butterfly hunt in winter Please you our friends herein to  join us as we retrace our ground this time for your indul  gence by the fireside but in good hope that by the next  we shall tempt you to follow us in right good earnest to the  field  Our first preserve and as already noticed one of the best  is our garden albeit but a very little one You might walk  THE ART OE SEEING  round it twenty times perhaps in an hour and on such a day  as this or yesterday might look about you for the Life in  Death of which we have been talking and see no signs of it  except in the evergreens and crocuses and snow drops and  hear no sound of it except in the voices of the thrush and  robin from among the leafless branches but he who would  become cognisant of surrounding Insect life veiled as it now  is under the apparent death of winter must try to provide  himself with spectacles none of your barnacles of crystal or  glass but a pair of invisible perceptors acquired by habits of  careful observation It has been aptly said that the memory  dwells in the heart and it might be observed with equal  justice that every other faculty and even every sense has its  seat in the heart also How quick of sight and quick of ear  are the dullest of us all to objects of such a sort as have once  gained a hold upon our lifting and what is it but our apathy  of heart towards Nature and its Mighty Author which with  reference to so much that belongs to them causes us to be for  ever verifying the assertion of one intelligent observer that   the art of seeing is but rarely practised  Well now to our garden Let us look around and here  on this bounding hedge we discern by help of the spectacles  in question a something rarely enough seen although exposed  to our view almost everywhere on every winters day Amidst  the intricate branches of the bare hawthorn stretches forth  an arm distinguished from the rest by a circlet of beads a  manyrowed bead bracelet as regularly wrought as bracelet ever  worn on ladys wrist or woven of silk and beads by ladys  fingers This piece of natural jewellery is the work of a  certain Mother Moth whose own eggs set in an indissoluble  weatherproof cement are the living gems of which it is com  posed We can tell you however that the hawthorn does  not after the fashion of some fairer wearers display this  ornament without having paid for it partly already in hard  green leaves of last summer the remaining price of her pearls  to be discharged in the forthcoming spring on the first issue  of new foliage The deceased manufacturer of this dearbought  ornament was a female Lackey member of a tribe so called  on account of the gaudy liveries blue and red white and  yellow in which while Caterpillars they are arrayed at the  cost as we have seen of the unhappy tree be it hawthorn  plum pear or blackthorn upon which they happen to be de  pendants often by dozens or scores stripping it of green  honours after the manner of lazy lackeys of another sort  the devourers of trees heraldic From these braceleteggs  will come forth with the opening leaves just in time to devour  them a new troop of these Lackey varlets which in due  season about June will doff their coats of many colours for  the sober chrysalidanbrown and in July emerge from their  Aurelian shrouds and cases a company of sobersuited light  brown Moths images of her their lady mother the constructor  of this bracelet That we may look into its workmanship a  little closer let us cut it from the hedge with the branch it  compasses and from which we can slip it like a ring We find  on inspection that each of the beads or eggs comprising it  though round externally is shaped like the arch stones of a  bridge the whole of them being cemented together in like  manner and thus rendered so strong compact and impervious  as to preserve unharmed through winters wet and cold the  embryo lives for whose protection it was intended  Here close at hand we have another illustration but how  beautifully varied of the same preserving care exerted  through the medium of instinctive agency On another  leafless spray of hawthorn hangs another group of Insect eggs  the embryo progeny of another maternal Moth These however  instead of being united as in the bracelet with strong cement  are loosely scattered but by no means carelessly for they are  laid upon an oval silken bed the warm cocoon which having  while she was a Chrysalis served to protect the mother was  converted by the maternal instinct of her mothhood into a winter  cradle for her eggs Thom these in the month of May will  appear a brood of Caterpillars at first dark and hairy after  wards black and grey with bright yellow tufts and red and  yellow spots and from these after the usual changes we shall  have a company of Moths called Vapourers the females of  which are almost wholly destitute of wings One of these was  the layer of the eggs in this cocoon which furnishes therefore  a striking instance of a seeming deficiency of organization  being compensated by an instinctive perception The mother  Moth has no wings wherewith to travel far in search of a safe  asylum for her eggs and she wonld seem for this reason  guided instinctively to employ her own discarded covering as  a bed suited to preserve them  Looking however at these germs of life as they lie here  exposed upon the leafless branches neither bed of cement nor  bed of silk wonld seem to afford a very secure protection  against the frosts and winds of winter Nor wonld they  perhaps but for the deathdefying quality of the vital sparks  within these tiny eggshells which appear while thus concen  trated to possess a stronger power of resisting cold than when  they animate their respective forms after expansion Insect  eggs have been found uninjured after exposure to an artificial  temperature of 22Â° below zero That of 16Â° or 17Â° has  sufficed to destroy Insects themselves and these of which  great numbers pass the winter in the egg have been noticed  as even more abundant than usual after seasons of extreme  severity An example of this fact is adduced by Rennie as  having occurred in the spring of 1830  Let us seek now for a specimen of insect life though still it  may be only Life in death advanced one step beyond its  threshold or from egg to Caterpillar But without a leaf yet  opened for its support where is the Caterpillar to be found  Perhaps we must go farther than our little garden to discover it  for as we look about us not a living thing or one like it can  we see except that rogue of a thrush busy yonder at a  currant bush Suppose we watch him and see if he may not  prove a guide an indicator to assist us in our search What  is he about Plucking and picking at the bare branches  when meanwhile close beside him lies a snail one of his  favourite morsels There goes the quickeared songster put  to flight even by our stealthy step but let him go we shall  find out all the same the business hes been after Aye aye  Sir Thrush we even thought so thy large bright eye has been  quicker than our own for all our boasted spectacles in dis  covering before us the very game for which we have been  hunting We are not so clever as thou art in detection of life  clothed in the garb of death On this branch of the currant  bush where thou wast so busy remains a trio of stiff stick like  little animals more like twigs than Caterpillars and distin  guishable only from the branch itself neither by form nor  motion but slightly by colour which instead of brown is  whitish yellow besprinkled with black These are the Mag  pie Caterpillars of the Magpie Moth numbers of which so  called from their mode of colouring are to be seen in almost  every garden flying heavily through the twilight of summers  evenings and from the eggs of one of them deposited on this  currant branch came forth in autumn the curious specimens  of still life now before us In these we have an instance  among others of Caterpillars defended through the winter by a  state of torpidity in which they have now continued for many  weeks without eating and will thus remain till the breath of  spring has roused them to activity and provided employment  for their jaws The power of Caterpillars also in resisting cold  has been proved by experiment to be very great scarcely  indeed inferior to that of insect eggs Those of the cabbage  frozen so stiff as to snap like glass have yet lived and  become Butterflies while others have revived after chinking  like stones when thrown into a glass  What next have we come to basking in a ray of wintry sun  shine on a root of dandelion It is another Caterpillar now a  very little one because short of his full growth not naked like  the tiny sticks of the Magpie but clothed a la Russe in a  brown fur jacket  The moment we touch him he curls up like a hedgehog  and falls from the plant upon the ground From this practice  he is known to some people by the appellation of a Devils  ring though why a creature harmless as a dove should have  acquired this misnomer it is hard to say His proper though  not in his present state a much more fitting appellation is the  Tiger Caterpillar of the Tiger Moth he is now more like a  little bear but bear or tiger we have now at home a box or  cagefull of the like animals born from the egg in the early  part of last October Instead of attaining in a few weeks to  the full measure of their bulk as is the case with the summer  broods of the same Caterpillar these like the little individuals  just encountered have been since an early stage quite stationary  as to growth nearly the same as to motion have kept on the  same coats instead of often changing them and it is only in  mild weather that they eat sparingly of the leaves of dandelion  wherewith it is not easy to supply them When the latter are  entirely nipped by frost or covered by snow our little winterers  subsist as well without them upon sleep In this their nice  and altered adaptation to a rigorous season and short supplies  are not the growth and appetite even of these Caterpillars  worthy of notice  With the arrival of April and a plentiful supply of dock and  dandelion green meat we shall find in our little Tigers a  proportionate increase of activity and appetite their skins as  they increase in size will be frequently cast and in May each  having attained to the full measure of its growth will display  to great advantage its jerkin of black velvet ornamented with  rows of white studs from each of which springs a long tuft of  goldbrown greytipped hairs forming en masse an upper  coat of fur Our Caterpillar will then speedily repay us for  the trouble of his keep by showing how cleverly he can make  his cocoon spinning it of his own silk interweaving it with  hair plucked from his own body and eking out these natural  materials by extraneous ones such as grains of earth pieces of  leaf or even bits of paper when placed within his reach  Shut up in this secure asylum he will become a chrysalis and  in two or three weeks come forth a Tiger Moth complete  a winged creature glorious in crimson dyes and richest  brown and cream colour Although these and a few other  furclad Caterpillars seem partly indebted to their clothing  for protection against the cold there are also several which  live through the winter and show moreover signs of life  that have scarcely a hair upon their backs Of these some  are exceedingly plump as well as smooth and have therefore  been supposed to be kept warm by encasing fat  Leaving the garden let us extend our hunt over a wider  range and here without the paling we discover hung upon  an oaktree another cloak of protection for Caterpillar life  amidst the surrounding death of vegetation We have here  no solitary survivors but a social company if social we may  designate a few dozens of half or quite dormant little animals   bidding defiance to Jack Frost from behind the triple tapestry of  a silken hammock woven by themselves This their winter dormi  tory is of shape irregular with here and there a brown oakleaf  woven into its outward texture the interior being divided also  with tapestry into various snug apartments where the little  inmates lie coiled together by twos and threes till waked into  activity by the coming spring These at present harmless  slumberers will grow by and bye into tremendous ravagers  of the oak and other trees and will then on the boughs they  have stripped bare be sufficiently discernible in their tufted  parure of black white and scarlet These are the progeny  of a pretty white moth yclept the goldtail from a tuft of  goldcoloured hair at the end of her body Protected in the  above and various other manners a number of future Moths  and Butterflies are now existent in the forms of Egg and Cater  pillar but many more of them by far indeed the larger  portion have been sleeping away the winter and are slumbering  yet as Chrysalides To disquiet and bring up one of these  Insect mummies from darkness into light let us make the  next object of our walk If we had had with us our exhuming  digger we might soon unearth some from beneath the trees  about us but in default of a trowel we must seek a chrysalis  buried indeed but not within the ground The light vege  table mould which fills the trunk of this decayed willow  has often furnished us with an Aurelian treasure and if one is  to be found there now a stick will suffice for its discovery  This time however explore it as we may our mine would  seem exhausted But stay What have we here A sort of  rough excrescence seeming to grow out of the tree just within  the edge of its shelllike trunk When we come to look at it  it seems not however like a vegetable growth nor yet a  vagary of decays sometimes creative fingers it is the  woodbuilt structure of a Caterpillar and his present dormitory  now that he has cast off his working dress and put on the  monastic habit of an idle chrysalis Let us look into his cell  or at least on its exterior a little closer  The fabric is of oval form composed of pieces of rotten  wood and bark meshed in and kept together by silk and gluten  the latter renders it so hard that it refuses to yield under  pressure of the finger we might perhaps force it though not  without trouble by aid of stick or knife but let us spare it  leaving its ingenious builder and occupant to finish unmolested  his winters nap to sleep on till the merry month of May and  then forcing his wooden walls by help it is said of an  expressly provided acid to expand his pencilled pinions on  the evening air  But it might please you curious companions of our ramble  to see for yourselves the pattern of those pretty pinions  and so in due time you shall for we have at home almost a  facsimile of this woodbuilt cell constructed under our own  eye by a brother artisan a Puss Caterpillar which as a  chrysalis now lives within it When as a young May Moth  it pleases to emerge we promise you its picture both in that  its palmy state as well as in its earlier capacity of ingenious  builder This Puss chrysalis has afforded a specimen of nu  merous others of the tribe of Moths now lying thus entombed  and enshrouded though in divers manners but besides these  there are some belonging to the race of Butterflies which may  now be much more easily detected as they hang both  shroudless and tombless betwixt earth and sky Yonder is  the wall of a kitchen garden let us cross the road to it and  we shall be sure almost to find an instance of what we speak  of Here is the very thing Just under the coping of the  wall its only shelter slung in horizontal position hangs a  chrysalis which by its shape angular instead of rounded as  well as by the open mode in which it is exhibited we recognise  at once as a future Hayflier and by the colour a greenish  yellow besprinkled with black no less than by its choice of  situation know it to have been in autumn a Cabbage Cater  pillar to appear in spring though not perhaps till May a large  white garden Butterfly It hangs here attached to the wall by  a double support a silken button at the tail and a band or  loop of threads round the middle of the body its last pieces of  ingenious workmanship while in the Caterpillar form and we  perceive also a thin silken web stretched over a small space  of the brick above This is a preparation of its surface to  receive the ends of the supporting girth which would not else  adhere On this last practice of the Cabbage Caterpillar a  curious observation has been made serving to illustrate the  variations of instinct to meet unusual circumstances When  confined in a box covered with muslin a texture to which its  silken girth can be easily attached without any previous pre  paration the caterpillar has been found to spare itself the  needless trouble of spining any such facing web We have  one now in our possession in a box where the web certainly  has been spun but our chrysalis being attached by its means  to the pasteboard side and not to the muslin top of its apart  ment offers no contradiction to the preceding statement  Let us linger for a while under this southern Avail The  sun gleaming at intervals all the morning has now come forth  in right good earnest and it is not for us to turn our back upon  the sun This February noon is more soft and gentle than  many a May morning and here we might believe it veritable  spring But why should we fancy it any thing but what it is  a day when surly winter like many other surly visitants  seems to have grown tender at thoughts of bidding us farewell  Besides we may wait with patience for spring leaves and  spring flowers for we are not without our verdure and our  blossoms too all the dearer in that they are more rare On  the face of this weatherbeaten wall our eye can regale itself  on pleasant patches of emerald velvet tufts of winter moss  bright enough to make the green of spring sicken and  turn yellow with envy Above rise the clustered flowerbuds  of the elder and yonder across the road hang the drooping  blossoms of the hazel What want we more in anticipation of  spring delights Not spring music while we are listening to  dear robins solo siveeter than an orchestra of warblers Care  we for spring Butterflies We may content us with their  promise as it hangs in safe dependence on the silken threads  of this our cabbage chrysalis and the remainder of its yet  quiescent crew But look What is flitting past us even  now In very sooth a Devils Butterfly has come from  the ivy overhead or a warmer place below to reproach us for  indifference to Butterfly presence or to upbraid yonder cabbage  sleeper for still sleeping on There now she has settled not  on the elder clusters nor yet on the hazle flowers but on this  leafless hawthorn and here do her golden pinions ope and  close as if she designed to enhance their living splendour by  contrast with the deathlike branches Well be thou But  terfly of devil or of witch as our brethren of Scotland  are wont to call thee we suppose for thy winterbraving  hardihood thou art a glorious creature and thy tamer name  of little Tortoiseshell does but sorry justice to thy glowing  beauty  Our pencil has not done thee more and were it endowed  with tenfold skill we should yet exclaim with fit humility oh   Who can paint like nature  A verbal portrait should we attempt minute description of thy  bright blue crescents and thy golden hair would do thee still  less credit We shall only therefore sketch broadly thy most  striking features that our friends wherever or whenever met  with may recognise at once the numerous members of thy  handsome family  This little Tortoiseshell which in common with others of  her hardy sisterhood has survived the winter her radiant  robes laid up in ivy or some other close green wardrobe belongs  to the beautiful genus Vanessa or Fanwinged Butterflies  which while in their state of spiny Caterpillars feed for the  most part upon nettles They are distinguished by their  warm rich colours their angular scalloped wings with points  at the hinder margin and the shortness of their fore legs  which do not serve the purpose of walking  Another species of the same genus Vanessa less common  than the above is the Io or Peacocks eye so called from  the eyelike spots looking out from the deep brownred of  its ample wings Then there is a Butterfly of another sort a  yellowrobed harbinger of spring the very first that comes  regularly in that capacity whose appearance we must an  nounce to be at hand We might have met him even in  our ramble of today If we had we should have known  and welcomed him as our favourite Brimstone he of the  smoothcut sulphur coloured pinions all four ending in a  pointed angle and dashed with a speck of reddishbrown   Cosi per entro loro schiera bruna  Sammusa luna con laltra formica  Forse a spiar lor via e lor fortuna Dante  In the midst of various other nations are now dwelling and  have dwelt from the year nobody knows what a pigmy  people whom we shall call Eormicans divided into tribes  and long celebrated for their activity industry and form of  government both civil and military  If stature were to be considered as the true measure of  greatness at no period could this dwarfish race have pretended  A MILITARY EXPEDITION AND A NEW  BATTLE OE THE AMAZONS  to compete with any of the nations over whose territories they  were distributed although in many other respects their  superiority was once indisputable To take England one  of their localities as an example When our ancestors lived  in scattered huts wore only skins and blue paint shot at  wild beasts with arrows and tore each other to pieces much  after wildbeast fashion it is certain that the Eormicans pro  genitors lived in cities wore polished armour possessed a sort  of artillery and fought pitched battles In one respect  however besides that of their high antiquity the people of  whom we are speaking although for the most part of eminently  terrestrial habits resemble the natives of the Celestial Empire  namely in their marked characteristic of stability understood  in the limited sense of standing still for as were their ancestors  so are their existing descendants and so will be their sons  sons to the hundred thousandth generation  The custom of slavemaking as still sanctioned by the  example of civilized and Christian nations has been always  practiced by certain tribes of this pigmy people In some  respects however our Lilliputian slaveowners are wofully  behindhand as compared with those of larger stature espe  cially with the dwellers in a certain Trans Atlantic Land of  Freedom They know not the meaning of Lynchlaw the  sound of a whip is never heard within their territories The  slaves live as well as their possessors and on some occasions  the common rule of such relationship being reversed would  no  SLAVES AND SLAVEHOLDERS  seem to take the chief authority into their own hands With  all this indulgence strange as it may appear these little slaves  are famous hands at labour No Jackofalltrades nor maid  ofallwork for be it here observed that they are all females  can beat them for universal usefulness The greater number of  their owners are of the same sex with themselves and what  may seem on this account the more remarkable is that they  are all without exception soldiers amazonian soldiers As  was once said by a certain corps of our own gentlemen mill  taires or said for them these lady warriors are a class who  fighting of course excepted never do anything It follows  consequently that their slaves have everything to do In a  populous city they are at once the builders the scavengers  the porters and the nurses of the infant population Nay  they are even the feeders of the grownup free community  which consists solely of the abovenamed lady soldiery a few  idle gentlemen and some two or three queens or princesses of  the blood The slave population being thus absolutely neces  sary to the comfort nay very existence of their owners it of  course follows that the keeping up of its numbers is a most  important matter This object is effected by predatory ex  cursions taken frequently into the territories of those harmless  unoffending tribes which furnish the desired supply and from  which the female warriors usually return triumphant each laden  with the useful if not glorious trophy of an infant captive  Arrived at the city of its captors each little slave in embryo  QUEENS OP FORMICA  Ill  is forthwith consigned to the charge of a compatriot slavenurse  who though ignorant perhaps as the precious innocent itself  that the ties of country or even of family unite them fondles  feeds and fashions it for the benefit of their common owner  into just such another patient busy factotum as herself  The government of all the Tormican states whether slave  making or otherwise is properly republican yet one sovereign  lady sometimes two sometimes even a triumvirate of queens  receive their homage And truly no monarchs obtain or could  desire a greater show of humbly devoted loyalty each royal  personage has her court and is surrounded by her courtiers  effeminate princes whispering soft nothings into her satiate ear  mailclad Amazons attending as her bodyguard while in her  royal progresses she is followed by admiring crowds but as to  real political power king or queen Log may boast as much In  short possessing an ample share of its honours and its pleasures  the chief business of royalty with the female sovereigns  of the states of Formica consists in supplying a numerous  progeny not merely to be provided for by the nation but  to keep up what would otherwise be its failing population  On a certain day of a certain year the Amazonian chieftains  of Rufia one of the slavemaking states of Formica assembled to  concert a plan of operation for a new campaign or marauding  expedition Some people might suppose that they had already  settled or that they would settle beforehand upon some decent  pretext for attacking their peaceful neighbours a matter which  sometimes puzzles the ingenuity of civilized cabinets but like  bold border chieftains or honest freebooters our warlike pigmies  always set at nought such empty preliminaries That moral  sensitiveness is not theirs which must wrap up motives in a  cloak to hide them if possible even from themselves and as  for their neighbours since it never consorts with their tactics to  give notice of an incursion they cannot to them of course  attempt to justify the making it  It was towards the close of a fine summers day that the  army of the Rufians consisting of a large body of infantry was  seen issuing from their capital Their march soon brought  them to an arid sandy plain strewn with rocky fragments  between which they pursued their way in winding but unbroken  files their polished brown corselets glistening like sparks of fire  in the glow of the declining sun Marching with great rapidity  considering their diminutive stature they soon traversed this  desertlike tract without loss or accident a matter for no  small congratulation seeing the manifold dangers to which their  exposed route had rendered them liable In the first place  that which to our little Amazons appeared as we have des  cribed it a rockstrewn plain was none other than a public  causeway used by the gigantic creatures who consider them  selves the lords of the land and had one of these happened  to pass by during the transit of the Rufian army his direful  footfall would have enveloped whole divisions in awful darkness  to be followed by annihilation  A somewhat similar but still more overwhelming agent of  destruction accompanied by deafening thunder perhaps by  fearful lightning might also have overtaken them in shape  of a tremendous revolving circle which would instantly have  ground them into powder amidst the coruscation of flint and  steel Biped enemies of lesser bulk but to them monsters  still with gaping toothless mouths might have swallowed up a  legion at one fatal swoop  These and other perils happily escaped the Rufians arrived  at what in our language is yclept a hedge though known in  theirs by a word or sign expressive of a mighty forest To  cross this barrier and reassemble in compact array on its  further side was a manoeuvre requiring not a little skill but  our little Amazonian troops effected it in the most creditable  manner which was the more surprising as they seemed destitute  of a leader or officers of any description to direct their move  ments  Leaving the woody barrier behind whose deep evening  shadow still threw the army and its movements into shade a  country which presented difficulties scarcely inferior yet lay  before them Imagine a troop of infantry or a soldier of that  troop compelled to force his way through an intricate jungle  composed of reeds so large that the least of them should more  than triple the girth of his own body so lofty that his eye  could scarcely reach the top of a single stem and all these  thickly interspersed with gigantic leafblades waving and  clashing above his head or lying across his path in intricate  confusion obliging him alternately to climb to leap over and  creep under these and a thousand other impeding obstacles  only we say imagine the fatigue and difficulty of such a pro  gress to a single individual and its hundredfold embarrassment  to one of a phalanx constrained to keep together and proceed  in a given course and yon must allow no little share of skill  perseverance discipline activity and strength to the Rufian  army in its laborious passage across an unmown field The  march being too long to accomplish at a stretch they were  obliged to bivouac for the night upon the plain of which a  small portion yet remained to be traversed Many of our little  Amazons crouched down weary and wet with the evening dew  some perhaps with spirits as well as corselets damped but  when they awoke in the morning all their ardour was renewed  They cared not for the morning dewdrops so bright and  glistening and as they gaily shook them off they discerned  through the overtopping grass the single dome of the city of  Fusca the capital of the dusky Fuscans which they were about  to besiege Then as with the valiant but weary crusaders  when they first beheld the domes and minarets of the Holy  City   Ali ha ciascuno al core ed ali al piede  both their hearts and heels acquired wings Onward they  pressed while some of the most ardent of the assailants  leaving the main body behind rushed forward to attack the  enemys sentinels who were posted at each of the avenues  leading down into the subterranean city  These watchful guards who presently gave notice of the  approaching army were like their assailants all Amazonian  soldiers only of a much milder and more pacific disposition  being used to combine gentle employments with their profes  sion of arms a prosession moreover never exercised except  defensively  Slavery as inflicted on others is a thing unknown among the  Tuscans and their working females who constitute the chief  bulk of the population are not only the sole defenders of the  state but also perform all the useful offices which among the  Bufians are made to devolve upon the slaves  When warned of the enemys unwelcome appearance the  inhabitants of Tusca those at least of them who belonged  to the preponderating class just mentioned were busied in their  usual avocations Some were building some clearing the  streets some tending their domestic cattle others waiting on  the great in other words the idle of the community others  feeding the children of the royal nurseries for with the Tuscans  all nurseries may be called royal because amongst them as well  as amongst the Bufians the privilege of maternity belongs  to royalty alone the queens being always the queenmothers  of their people  Though thus taken by surprise amidst their multifarious  employments the garrison of Tusca had one advantage  though not forewarned they were always forearmed Like  the knightly ten of Branksholme who   quitted not their harness bright  Neither by day nor yet by night  they always ate drank worked even nursed in their coats of  mail never laid down their arms and always carried their  ammunition about them Having therefore no belts to buckle  no guns to load no horses to saddle the defending force was  presently mustered and issuing in various divisions from the  city gates left few within its walls or to speak more  correctly within the protecting dome by which it was sur  mounted except the cowardly and helpless to wit the  masculine portion of its inhabitants wholly made up of effemi  nate lords who always hung about the court the numerous  infant families which claimed the queens of which there were  three for mothers their Fuscan majesties themselves with  several princesses and besides these only their immediate and  indispensable attendants namely a few compelled to remain  within the nurseries and the royal bodyguard a little Ama  zonian band as brave and as much devoted to Fuscan royalty  as were the redgranite Swiss to the unhappy majesty of  France  Now comes the tug of war The defenders are assembled  in front of their city fighting for their queen their lives and  the liberty of their infant population The assailants their  main body having now come up are fighting for glory and for  plunder and above all for the rape of Tuscan babies to become  the future slaves of their own rising generation Oh for a  Homers pen to describe the universal ardour and the indivi  dual prowess of our pigmy Amazons By far more numerous  are the dusky Tuscans though in discipline and personal  strength they are much inferior to the warlike Rufians Of  the latter we have spoken hitherto as Lilliputians but now  we have to treat of them as opposed to a tribe of very inferior  stature  The battlefield an area of some four feet square is strewed  with dead and dying Sulphureous fumes exhale around  Single combatants by thousands each so eager in their re  spective contests as to seem unconscious of all besides have  spent their ammunition but with rancour undiminished behold  them now limb to limb head to head seized by each other  and held in savage grip now wrestling upright now rolling  in the dust long does the dubious strife continue till a third  Rufian or Tuscan comes to turn the balance and throw  death into the ascending scale In another quarter see perhaps  a dozen combatants of either party all firmly linked together  in a living chain dashing writhing like a wounded snake in  serpentine convulsions till snap goes a link beneath a mortal  blow but in an instant the dissevered portions reunite and  struggle on with double fury  Look now at that powerful longlimbed Rufian and the active  little Tuscan her opponent the latter springs like a cat o  mountain on the chest of her bulkier foe but clearly does she  pay for her temerity Caught in the grasp of the Amazonian  Ajax she is crushed and falls strangled to the earth She  falls but let not her conqueror exult a sister heroine no  bigger than herself and like herself carrying in a little body  a mighty mind beholds and vows to avenge her fate She  too springs upon the Eufian but with more effective grasp  her powerful jaws enclosing as in a vice one limb of her  athletic antagonist The Eufian severs in twain the body of  her assailant its lower half falls and is trampled in the dust  but horrible to see the upper portion still retains its hold  supported by the jaws which death has doublelocked The  fixed eyes continue to look up angrily into the living face the  rigid arms to encircle the Avarm body of the wounded Eufian  Vainly she strives to shake off the hideous burthen like the  old Man of the Mountain it will not be dislodged arid though  the Amazon of Eufia left that battlefield yet   ever more  The lady wore  carried perforce about her the slaughtered Tuscans head and  shoulders frightful trophy of her dearbought victory  But how goes the day How flows the tide of battle Will  Eufia or will Tusca will might or right prevail Shall the  infant Tuscan females grow up to be maids of allwork at  home or slaves of all work in a foreign land  They run they run Who run inquires the eager but  dying gaze of a wounded Amazon lialf raising her recumbent  form and trying to scan the face of the field through the mist  of her glazing eye She saw them not but too plainly to be  seen were the vanquished Tuscans in full retreat towards the  city which their efforts bad proved ineffectual to defend The  remnant of their army still numerous though more than half  destroyed having reached the domelike roof which covered in  their subterranean capital were seen to overspread its surface  then suddenly to disappear defiling downwards through the  descending streets But the enemy was close at hand and the  dome just occupied by the scattered citizens swarmed presently  with the invading legions The latter were soon in possession  of the principal entrances but even while these were being  won their sappers and miners opened breaches in the earthen  masonry of the dome so that the entire force of the invaders  was speedily pouring from all quarters into the unhappy city  Who can paint the scene that followed Who can number  the innocents that day made captive There was Rachel  weeping for her children but strange anomaly the Rachels  who wept for them who had bled for them and died for them  were not their mothers These the queens of Tusca shut up  within their palaces surrounded by their faithful bodyguard  heard the din without the strife the lamentations and moved  not perhaps were not permitted to move their august persons  to inquire the cause It was not the mothers but the loving  fostermothers at once the tender nurses and the brave de  fenders of the baby Tuscans who driven from the field still  struggled to preserve them Their deeds of devoted heroism  would fill a volume one of them will adorn a page A  Bufian enters an apartment where ten of the little Tuscans are  committed to the care of one attendant on whom she rushes  The ruthless Amazon by main weight bears her to the ground  then severing with her trenchant weapon the lower limbs of  their faithful guardian snatches up two of the infants and  retreats But life and affection are still strong within the  dismembered body of the devoted nurse Moving on her  bleeding trunk she bears with persevering agony first one  then another of her helpless charges to a place of concealment  and not till the last is hidden as she fondly hopes from the  search of its enemies does she fall down and die  Triumphant was the homeward march of the victorious  Bufians each Amazonian victress shouldering her ravished  bantling Of the little captives some the pupa were wrapt in a  sort of swaddling clothes whilst others the larva who were  younger and not thus enthralled felt equally ill at ease under  the awkward handling of their warlike captors No longer  keeping in consequence perhaps of their acquired encum  brances the regular array in which spite of impeding obstacles  they had advanced towards the ransacked city their return  for the greater portion of the way was straggling and irregular  but converging from all points they at last reassembled again  in a compact body before their own capital  Then did the slavesentinels give joyful notice of the con  querors approach with their slavebooty Then did the slave  nurses hasten to receive the slavebabies transferred to their  tender care Little did they dream poor simple bodies that  the ravished nurslings had sprung of the same race perhaps  of the same parentage as themselves And what mattered it  since in their ignorance was bliss And so while some  among them hushed and dandled and fed their little com  patriots and cousins in captivity others much after the fashion  of a gulled constituency chairing a successful member carried  their victorious captors in triumph to their homes Then  while the illustrious Amazons reposed after their recent toils  toils undertaken for the express purpose of being the better  able to indulge in idleness others of their attendants also of  course slaves served them with the most delicious viands  which to their recipients would probably have been more  grateful still could they have been even spared the trouble of  opening their mouths  Thus were the free nnrseries of Tusca stripped almost to ex  tinction that the slave nurseries of Rufia might be replenished  to overflowing An unfair procedure doubtless but we must  not throw a stone at an anthill of oppression while we  tolerate a mountain of the like as heaped by certain of our  so called Christian brethren on their brethren of our race  The foregoing like many another historic record of a graver  nature is not we confess it exactly true but the following  notes drawn chiefly from Huber the veracious chronicler of  the Ant nations will show that our fiction treads very closely  on the heels of fact  The wars of Ants were observed long ago and one of their  battles fought under the pontificate of Eugenius IV was  honoured by having for its historian JEneas Sylvius who was  afterwards Pope himself as Pius II The most warlike of the  Ant tribes according to Huber is the Wood ant the largest  British species of which we have elsewhere told a tale with  relation to other than its military characteristics These as  well as its domestic doings are delightfully described by the  above writer and a walk to some neighbouring wood is almost  sure to afford personal acquaintance with these sylvan warriors  with their corselets of rusty red and black head and tail pieces  There also we may see their fortified cities their military  roads diverging from these citadels like so many rays  from a centre their regular battles with the same or a weaker  species their skirmishes their single combats their ambus  cades their barricades and all the pomp and circumstance  of Pormican warfare But though it was known centuries  ago that Ants made war it was not discovered till of late  years and that by Huber himself that they also made slaves  seizing them while in their infancy their state of larva or of  pupa to be trained up for their service by compatriot slaves  already grown up in the same  The Woodant above mentioned has been frequently de  tected in thus making free with members of its neighbours  infant population and may probably turn them to the like  useful account but the slavemaker par excellence is a larger  brown species Formica Eufescens not a native of the free soil  of England though the slavemade F Fusca or the negro is  In the representation of these our Rufians and our Euscans  as Amazons we have strayed but little if at all from nature  inasmuch as the fighters and workers of Ant as well as Bee  communities are all females though imperfectly developed  the few of another description who are the sole mothers of  the community receiving as such the homage paid to  sovereignty Their courts their attendants their bodyguard  their sentinels are no coinage of our own fancy but the very  words used by careful observers as best descriptive of the agents  and offices which have come under their notice If a few of  our terms and incidents still seem exaggerated for artillery  read a discharge of formic acid accompanied by a sulphureous  odour commonly ejected by the angry Ant for trenchant  weapons read the powerful jaws with which it can sever a  limb or head of an antagonist and you have plain matter of  fact By employment of these same jaws as holdfasts the head  of a conquered Ant is not unfrequently says our authority seen  suspended to the leg or an antennae of its victor a trouble  some trophy which he carries to the day of his death Again  the following is only a simpler version of the story of our  devoted Tuscan nurse A worker Ant severed in two has  been observed with its upper half to carry to the nest no less  than ten of the pupse or larvae of the community and  numerous are the like traits related of their devotion to their  charges When their cities are besieged says Huber they are  sometimes seen by hundreds carrying off their young to pre  serve them from the enemy bearing them in their jaws to the  summit of neighbouring plants or hiding them beneath their  foliage and when the danger seems overpassed then do they  take them home again barricading the gates and guarding the  approaches The males of the Anthill like those of the Bee  hive are nonentities except in the paternal character of which  however all the duties devolve as we have seen upon the  indefatigable workers Their maternal majesties or queens are  more estimable personages having as foundresses of colonies  been in their time meritorious hardworkers themselves  however they may enjoy afterwards the sweets of wellearned  leisure Both the last named classes the aristocracy of their  tribe are accustomed to keep their state in private till after  midsummer when they often exhibit themselves mingled with  the vulgar herd on the domes of or adjacent to their cities  Seen thus associate they may be known as Ants by their  company but they differ so widely from the working sisterhood  not only in possessing wings but in shape size and some  times colour as to appear like insects of another kind  In these the differing forms of the different orders of a  Formic community we perceive an admirable fitness for the  respective parts assigned them The workers with bodies  narrow jointed and pliant strong limbs large heads and large  powerful jaws are framed for all activities of labour and of  war The lordly idlers thicker bodied more delicately limbed  smaller headed destitute entirely of trenchant mandibles the  universal tool and w T eapon of the warlike workers and pos  sessed of wings which would serve only as encumbrances in  toils chiefly subterranean thus bear externally their warrant  of exemption from taking part therein Last not least the  queenly females of matronly and portlybulk and with pinions  of regal amplitude white and glittering are endowed equally  with proper persons proper to their places   Sore wondren some on cause of thunder  On ebb and flood on gossamer and mist  And on all things till that the cause is wist  The weather is dry warm and still yet without a gleam of  sunshine a combination of winter gloom with almost summer  mildness Gossamer is floating or falling slowly through the  air numerous spiders are hanging motionless head downwards  in the centre of their geometric webs lying in wait for prey  while others restlessly ascending blades of grass or railposts  are inwardly invoking we suspect the presence of some gentle  air to assist them in shooting their lines those threads of  suspension long and strong on which is to hang the ingenious  fabric of their toils This shooting of the spiders lines and  that associate wonder the origin of Gossamer may as well  form our not unseasonable theme Autumn indeed is more  especially the period when   Gossamer floats or stretched from blade to blade  The wavy network whitens all the field  but October if we are permitted to enjoy its mellow riches we  shall find so much more fertile than the present month in insect  subjects that we are glad to take this of Gossamer now  from the comparatively few instead of choosing it then from  amongst the many  The apparent flight of the wingless spider from tree to tree  across water and even through the upper regions of air has  been almost as great a puzzle to naturalists as the Flys walk  against gravity It was no doubt soon discovered that this  flight in seeming was no more a real one than that of an  aeronaut in a balloon or than those of the foolhardy adven  turers such as from the times of Hogarth to our own have now  and then made ropeborne transits from steeple to steeple  That the spider travelled by a line was apparent enough to  nice observers but the marvel long was how such lengthy  lines could be shot forth as when attached accidentally to  some fixed body serve to provide the insect traveller with  a cable bridge to cross from plant to plant or from tree to  tree or when floating loosely serve equally to promote the  more ambitious purpose of bearing him upwards when dis  posed to mount in air  Conjectures numerous and intricate as thse aeronautic  threads and often baseless as themselves when detached from  their point d appui have been hazarded on the above curious  subject but it seems now pretty clearly ascertained that air is  the chief and indispensable agent in the shooting of the lines  and consequent progress or ascent of the aeronautic spider  Several of these insects were placed on a branch fixed upright  in a vessel of water On exposure to a slight current of air  they all directed their chests towards the quarter from whence  it came and each emitted from its raised spinneret a small  portion of glutinous matter which was instantly carried out  into a line The Spiders then ascertained by pulling at them  with their legs whether or not these threads had taken hold of  and become attached to any object and in this case after  having tightened they made them fast to the branch they  occupied thus forming bridges for escape over which they  passed in safety drawing after them a second line as a security  in case the first should fail This was always their mode of  proceeding when in the way of a current but under a bellglass  some were found to remain seventeen days without being able  to produce a single line whereby to quit their watergirt branch  of durance By a thread similarly produced but unattached  the little aeronaut can spring up into the air nor is it says  Mr Rennie indispensable for her to rest upon a solid body  when producing a line as she can do so while suspended in  the air by another  However incurious about their mode of formation nobody  can have taken an early morning walk especially towards  autumn without having noticed these lines or webs of the  Gossamer Spider spread over hedge and field a silken network  studded with dewdrop diamonds The prodigious extent of  these woven fabrics only corresponds with the surprising mul  titude of their fabricators of whom twenty or thirty will some  times be found assembled upon one straw of stubble It would  appear on these occasions as if a portion of the skylarks  soaring spirit infused by his animating song was at work  within these little creeping forms All seem bent upon the  object of ascension all are in progress towards the summit of  their respective stations whether stubble straw blade of grass  hedgetwig or railing Having climbed to the greatest height  their legs will carry them they raise their abdomens to a  position nearly perpendicular at the same time emitting a  portion of the glutinous substance which forms their webs  this being acted on by the ascending current is presently drawn  out into fine long lines when the spiders quitting their hold  of the objects whereon they stand are carried aloft on their  journey towards the clouds  FORMATION OF GOSSAMER  Thus in the words of Paley has this little animal with no  wings or muscles enabling it to dart a path laid for it by its  Creator in the atmosphere Though the Spider itself be  heavier than air the thread it spins is specifically lighter  This is its balloon left to itself it would drop to the ground  but being tied to the thread it is supported All Spiders  however different the form of their webs are said to proceed  alike in shooting their lines but those who may desire to  watch the process above described are recommended by  Mr Bennie to select for their observation one or other of the  following species common in almost every field and garden  The small Gossamer known by its shining blackishbrown  body and reddish transparent legs or the Longbodied Spider  which varies in colour from green to grey or brownish but  has always a black line along the belly with a silvery white or  yellowish one on each side  Having thus seen the way in which Spiders shoot their  lines we come now to the examination of Gossamer of which  these lines form the material After having served singly  their fabricators turn either as bridges to cross the vacant  gulf or as balloons to rise sky wards they are brought together  by the action of gentle airs gradually assume the shape of  fleecy flakes composed of irregular silky masses and then by  an ascending current of rarified air are borne hundreds of feet  into the atmosphere On falling when the upward current  ceases it would appear by observation of the naturalist above  referred to that few of these webs contain a Spider though  numerous winged insects are found entangled in them Dr  Lister however found more than once in the webs which  he saw fall from heaven one of these mounting Spiders which  he calls birds and describes some of them as converting  their floating lines into chariots or balloons of flake by pulling  them in with their forefeet as they fly From the top of York  Minster the same observer watched the descent of webs high  above him and on examination of some caught on the pinnacles  of the cathedral considered such of the adventurous aeronauts  as he found within them to be all juveniles of light weight  corresponding to their age One of them he calls an excellent  ropedancer wonderfully delighted with darting its threads  adding that by means of its legs closely applied to each other it  as it were balances itself and promotes and directs its course no  otherwise than as if nature had furnished it with wings or oars  The above appears at least a probable account of the  formation of Gossamer that substance of earthly and not  celestial manufacture to the mystery of whose origin Chaucer  alludes in our prefixed motto Some two centuries later in  the days of Spenser our ancestors seem to have arrived at no  likelier solution of this natural enigma than the supernatural  idea that these rising and falling fleeces were composed of dew  burned by the sun the Poet speaking of them as  The fine nets which oft we woven see  Of scorched dew  This is a strange supposition viewed either as poetic or as  popular but stranger still was that of Dr Hooke a learned  philosopher and first Fellow of the Royal Society who lived  in times so much nearer our own as the latter part of the  17th century On microscopic scrutiny of these webs looking  most like a flake of worsted ready to be spun he surmised  that it was not unlikely that those great white clouds that  appear all the summer time may be of the same substance  From the floating lines and aerial chariots of the Spiders  which make Gossamer let us descend to a few of the humbler  fabrics woven by the same and various other species to serve  as habitations or as snares  Who is not familiar too familiar for appreciation of their  excellent workmanship with the radiate wheellike nets so  common in gardens and on hedges throughout the summer  and on dewy autumn mornings rendered so brightly conspi  cuous by the liquid pearls which they serve to string In  addition to these borrowed gems the spiral lines of geometric  webs have been shown by the microscope to be beset by a  number of viscid globules The ingenious weavers of these  wheels within wheels are various species of that tribe of  Spiders called from their lines and circles the Geometric  those of them most commonly known are the Garden  Epeira Diadema and the Longbodied Tetragnatha  extensa noticed already among the aeronauts As with these  the first operation of our geometric spinner is to throw out a  floating line which having caught on some convenient hold  fast she strengthens with additional threads till it forms a  strong cable of support to which from various adjacent points  she proceeds to add others until an irregular framework is  prepared for the radiated net which is to be hung within it  Using her own limbs as rule and compasses to measure the  distance of its spokes and circles she then constructs her geo  metric wheel and when completed most usually forms its  centre with her body still as death but all eyes and ears  and sentient feet ready to spring on the first victim that enters  her fatal maze Occasionally she leaves vacant the centre of  her net but it is only to lurk hard by under a leaf or other  covert  In these wheellike snares there is extreme diversity of size  Stretching across from tree to tree we have seen them occupy  the breadth of a broad garden walk and have found others  comprised within the narrow area of a single leaf  Among the outdoor fabrics woven by Spiders which can  hardly fail to attract the eye however little they may fix atten  tion are those large white broadsheets sloping downwards into  tunnels of which numbers are so frequently seen spread out  upon the grass and lower bushes These webs of which each  serves a single occupant both as a residence and a snare are  attached by silken ropes to adjacent objects The sides of the  horizontal broadsheet sloping obliquely downwards till nearly  perpendicular form towards its centre a cylindrical tunnel and  sitting near its mouth the lurker shaded by the darkness of her  covered way is ready to rush forth and seize on the first hapless  wanderer that becomes entangled in her fatal web This  cunning artificer can only be captured by the artifice of getting  behind and driving her upwards and out of her tunnel into  which she always descends upon the first alarm  In addition to the silken material of which they always carry  with them an internal magazine there are various out door  Spiders which employ leaves in the construction of their  retreats and that after a fashion both ingenious and elegant  We have sometimes plucked a rolled up lilac or young oak leaf  expecting to find it tenanted by a leafrolling Caterpillar when  lo upon the scroll being opened out ran a small longbodied  Spider which after lining it with silk had taken possession of  it as his cell Structures more spacious consisting not of one  but of several leaves lined and united by a silken web serve  often for the abodes of various Spiders found in woods and  gardens but of these few are so curious and elegant as a  singleleaf cell which we have often found on nettles In this  the point and sides of the leaf being turned over so as to  meet at the edges are conjoined with silk and on carefully  forcing up one of the corners of the green triangle we intrude  on the domestic privacy of a maternal Spider keeping tender  watch over her bag or ball of eggs  Everybody must have sometimes noticed both within doors  and without a spider thus brooding over a ball usually bigger  spiders eggs and their envelopes  than her body with which on alarm she makes off with all  possible expedition These balls popularly known as Spiders  eggs are in fact made up of a numerous group of them  enclosed within a woven envelope and the way in which these  spinning mothers proceed to  tie their treasure up in silken bags  is another very curious exercise of their weaving art Using  her own body after the manner pf a nestbuilding bird as a  measure for its circumference the spider spins first the  lower half of her intended covering which in this stage of its  progress resembles a cup or nest She then proceeds to lay  her eggs and over these when piled up within weaves a  convex cover which united with the receptacle at bottom  renders the ball complete These silken eggpurses vary in  colour those of the HouseSpiders being white of the common  Garden yellow of other outdoor species blue or greenish  In form they are usually globular but variations from this  shape are occasionally met with Last summer we noticed an  exceedingly pretty one in the instance of a small greenish Spider  variegated with white of which we found many on the leaves  of a wall plum tree keeping watch and ward over their nests  These which were attached to the under side of the leaf were  white and of an elegant urnlike shape something resembling  the seed case of a poppy Bound the circumference of the top  or cover were five and in other specimens seven points  another rising pyramidically from its centre  We have as yet said nothing of the toils of the common  HouseSpider but so secretly and slily does that cunning  artificer ply her craft that some of the most clever natu  ralists have been puzzled and are still at fault as to the precise  manner in which she goes to work One has declared that she  can weave the warp and weave the woof but as observed  by another if she ever possessed she has in these modern  days forgot this process in her manufacture When in com  mencing her horizontal fabric she desires to stretch her  first line from wall to wall across her chosen corner it would  appear that she walks round the intervening angle carrying in  one of her claws the end of her thread which has been  previously fixed a mode of proceeding supposed by Rennie  to be requisite on account of the horizontal position of her net  which could not be ensured by allowing its first line to be  fixed at hazard as with those shot out by the weavers of  Gossamer  Numerous other Spiderwrought fabrics as varied in shape  and texture as in their process of formation and intended for  snares for habitations or for eggnests are constructed by the  hairylegged spinners of our native island but perhaps we  must look for the deacons of their craft amongst those of  foreign extraction None for instance of our Arachnean  artificers at present known are able we believe to compete  with the marvellous skill of the Mason Spider of the tropics  and of Southern Europe which to the mouth of its retreat an  excavated subterranean cell tapestried with silk contrives to  adjust an earthkneaded door hung upon a silken hinge and  selfclosing with an elastic spring after each entrance and  exit of the ca vends occupant  Eor description in full of this foreign masterpiece of  Arachnean architecture we must refer to other pages and  pursuing the main purpose of our own invite attention to  the constructive skill of one more native Spider  Who has not seen or is not curious to behold that lion  of the Polytechnic the divingbell Now those who for lack of  opportunity are among the latter may see a divingbell in mina  ture by repairing to the brink of some running stream canal  or ditch provided it be not stagnant in the neighbourhood of  London or elsewhere There they may perceive shining through  the water a little globe apparently of silver which surrounds as  with a garment the body of a Diving Spider whose submerged  habitation and curious economy have been described as follows  by different observers These Spiders says De Geer spin in  the water a cell of strong closely woven white silk in the form  of a divingbell or half a pigeons egg This is sometimes  quite submerged at others partly above the water and is  always attached to some objects near it by a number of  irregular threads It is closed all round but has a large  opening below which however I found closed on the 15 th of  December and the Spider living quietly within with her head  downwards I made a rent in this cell and expelled the air upon  which the Spider came out yet though she appeared to have  been laid up for three months in her winter quarters she  greedily seized on and sucked an insect The male as well as  the female constructs a similar subaqueous cell and during  summer as well as winter One of these spiders was kept by  Mr Rennie several months in a glass of water where it built  a cell half submersed in which it laid its eggs These are  enclosed in bags of yellow silk and are hatched in summer  But it is in the pages of Kirby and Spence that we find  the habitations and habits of this amphibious architect most  strikingly and pleasantly describedt Her abode say they  built in water and formed of air is constructed on philosophic  principles and consists of a subaqueous yet dry apartment in  which like a mermaid or a seanymph she resides in comfort  Loose threads attached in various directions to the leaves of  aquatic plants form the framework of her chamber Over  these she spreads a transparent elastic varnish like liquid  glass which issues from the middle of her spinners next she  spreads over her belly a pellicle of the same material and  ascends to the surface to inhale and carry down a supply of  atmospheric fluid Head downwards and with her body all  but the spinneret still submersed our diver by a process  which does not seem precisely ascertained introduces a bubble  of air beneath the pellicle which surrounds her Clothed in  this aerial mantle which to the spectator seems formed of  resplendent quicksilver she then plunges to the bottom and  with as much dexterity as a chemist transfers gas with a  gasholder introduces her bubble of air beneath the roof  prepared for its reception this manoeuvre is ten or twelve times  repeated and when she has transported sufficient air to expand  her apartment to its intended extent she possesses an aerial  edifice an enchanted palace where unmoved by storms she  devours her prey at ease Fancywoven from the foregoing  description is the Fairy Tale which forms the subject of the  next episode  THE FRESHWATER SIREN   My airbuilt bower come and see   Stranger come and dwell with me  An armourclad Rover is sauntering near  At the Sirens sweet accents he pricks up his ear   Gramercy quoth he She bespeaketh me kind   And to pay her my devoirs Ive almost a mind  u If saint or if sinner would show me the road   To this goodnatured damsels alfresco abode  Then he looked at the water exploring it through  And there if his sight brought him evidence true  He beheld neath its surface in silver bedight  A most lovely Ladye No gallant young Knight  Could wish for a fairer in air and in mien  Tho as to her face not a feature was seen  Twas so veiled in the blaze of her mantles bright sheen  Again sweetly she sang See my watergirt home   Come down to my palace of pleasure oh come  But the Knight he stood dubious the streamlet was deep  He prudently looked ere he ventured to leap  But the Ladye impatient upraised neck and hand  To grasp hold of his as he stood on the land  Then ye powers of darkness the sight that he sees  Any mortals warm blood was sufficient to freeze  Though boiling beneath a fierce tropical sun  Or on Lawrences gridiron very near done  The most bleareyed of witches the nightmare most foul  The most grim of hobgoblins the loathsomest ghoule  Would have seemed as the fairest of Eves lovely daughters  To the horrible thing half raised out of the waters  Its long hairy arms so gaunt rigid and thin  Were as dark and as dry as an old mummys skin  Its eyes glassy and fixed as a fishs when dead  Glared fiercely like fiery coals in its head  And like lamps were hung over its horrible jaw  The portcullis that led to its cavernous maw  The grimlooking spectre but rose as a flash  That blasted the vision then sank with a splash  And enwrapped in her mantle of magical light  Once more seemed a fairy all beauteous and bright  Save only the hand raised the water above  Which still circled the wrist of the warriors glove  This wight and a fortunate hap twas for him  Was not framed like us mortals in body or limb  Neath the back of his glittering corselet lay hid  Like Jackinthebox crumpled under his lid  A pair of transparent and powerful wings  Could be folded and opened by wonderful springs  From all that hed seen hed a pretty good notion  That now was the time to set them in motion  So his hand snatched away without further ado  Wide open the plates of his corselet he threw  And a moment beheld him high poised in the air  Looking down with a smile on the Sirens despair  While uprose from the water her soft witching strain  Sung sweetly as erst though I wist now in vain   My airbuilt bower come and see   Come stranger come and dwell with me  By my fay quoth the Knight Fve beheld quite enough   And as for your bower tis all a mere puff   Fd only advise you when next youM deceive   To keep to your element so take my leave  With a shriek of despair the witch rose up once more  Looking though it was hard still more grim than before  Then she sank with a splash like a ponderous stone  Disappeared at the bottom and muttered a groan  Mumbled many a curse on the gallant winged rover  Crouched in dolorous rage till her spleen was gone over  Then determined her twig to redaub with new lime  And not suffer her bird to escape the next time  On the day of her birth  Or on that of the earth  Or on some such grand anniversary  Queen Nature made sport  With the dames of court  And the bairns of her royal nursery  From a giltedged cloud  The lark sang loud  The fish were in extasy leaping  Each leaf danced light  In the sunshine bright  And none but the owls were sleeping  All animate things  With responsive strings  Then abroad on the sunny earth  Unless by age rusted  Or trouble encrusted  Were as harps in the hand of mirth  With the rest of the revellers a young Gallant gay  Eight proud in the gloss of his silken array  By the glistening water was sauntering along  Now cutting the rushes now humming a song  Careless of all if he had known a care  Twas the loss Bother day of a treacherous fair  He had merrily whistled her down the wind  And now twas heighho but another to find  Black or brown red or blue if of feminine gender  All other enchantments the season would lend her  Looking blithely about him around and around  In every direction except on the ground  Our gay Gallant stumbled now guess ye on what  On viper or toad or a sherd of a pot  His hair bristled with fright with fear dropped his jaw  Yet hed trodden on naught save a feminine paw  Hairy and black and armed with a claw  Squatting toadfashion amidst the sedge  Which divided the path from the waters edge  Sat our former acquaintance the baffled crone  Now wearing no semblance excepting her own  From bottom to top from one end to the other  Unveiled to the sight well I wot such another  Was not to be seen on that fine summers day  When all wore their best faces and brightest array  There again were the arms so long hairy and spare  The fiery fixed eyes with their horrible glare  The misshapen head with a great corporation  Whose members were wasted to attenuation  Oh well might out Gallants heart quiver and quake  Well might his limbs like an aspen leaf shake  Well his jaw it might drop well might bristle his hair  As the loathly old creature bespoke him thus fair   Courteous Sir why this alarm  Fear no hindrance dread no harm  Im a gentle Fairy Sprite  For beauty famed  The Peerless named  Suffering under foul despite   In an unpropitions hour  A jealous Fay of greater power  Enwrapped me in a magic spell  Hid beneath this streamlet deep  Where waterelves their revels keep  Eor a space Em doomd to dwell   Or if I rise to upper air  My proper form so bright and fair  Assumes this strange and hateful guise  Now if you doubt the words I say  As woe is me perchance you may  Then gentle Sir believe your eyes  As she uttered these words sliding off from the bank  The illfavoured thing like a crocodile sank  And then in a trice her form shrouded in light  In a silvery mantle which dazzled the sight  Again she uplifted that sweet siren strain  So oft she had sung and of late sung in vain   My airbuilt bower come and see   Come stranger come and dwell with me  As she warbled our Gallants unused trepidation  Gave way to a species of queer fascination  He gazes debates Is it far beyond credence  That the witchs fine tale obtained something like heedence  When hundreds jump into some Lake of Killarney  With no witchery at all save some fair Katherines blarney  Oh twas then for some raven to croak in his ear  Or one crow boding sorrow to flap her wings near  But alas in that hour of revel and rout  Not an ominous thing was seen lurking about  One more dubious look on the water he cast  One look on the sun that look was his last  Underneath the bright water and neath the bright sun  A most horrible deed on that day was done  The blue streamlet put on a deep rubicund dye  And the fishes felt qualmish they could not tell why  Part m Cfitrh  Fast as acorns in autumn fall into a pool  In the Sirens receiver droppd many a fool  I wot those that got in were neer known to get out  But by tongues in the air it was bruited about  That a beauteous enchantress who lived upon flesh  Was the fowler that caught these young birds in her mesh  The place where she lurked none exactly could tell  Though many looked wise just as if they knew well  And others said waking or else in a dream  They had seen something float in the crystal stream  Thus the Sirens abode or its neighbouring location  Obtained by degrees but a sad reputation  Yet the beldame found out a fact provd in society  That there s nothing so gainful as bad notoriety  Her decoy overflowed where she caught one before  Well I ween she would now lay hold of a score  From old and from young from high and from low  From widows in weeds and from maidens in woe  There now daily arose such a shrill lamentation  That it entered at length the long ears of the nation  The deputies meet vent a torrent of pity  And their eloquence spent they appoint a committee  To sit on this cockatrice egg of affright  And try if they couldnt bring something to light  It might seem a hard task information to glean  On what people knew nought of and scarcely had seen  Yet of witnesses numerous I wot was no lack  And of evidence ample to break a mules back  Strange the mystery remaind without further solution  But then the committee passd this resolution  A wonderful judgment carried nem con  That the parties yet absent were certainly gone  To which an amendment was finally carried  That theyd not have been lost if at home they had tarried  After all there were gentlemen missd as before  And the waterwitch throve as shed thriven of yore  But twas vain now for wives of bereavement to chatter  Bor the senate declared having sat on the matter  That the grievance in question was certainly crushed  And that all future murmurs must therefore be hushed  But cheer up all ye widows whose loss is no gain  A champion is near to avenge all your pain  Cheer up wives and maidens dismiss your alarms  Not long the foul Siren shall work her fell charms  Look not down to the earth but look up on high  Your deliverer comes cutting athwart the blue sky  On light sprays hung  By silk cords slung  Oerarched by a silken dome  Is the airy hall  With waterproof wall  Where the Siren makes her home  By a waving screen  Of emerald green  Her bower is girt about  But a lucent gleam  From the sparkling stream  Looks in from the world without  For a river sprite  Or a naiad bright   Twas fit for a fairy queen  Nay that pendent cell  Might have suited well  For the boudoir of sweet Ondine  In this nice little snuggery sat the witch crone  Deep immersed in the sweets of a large marrowbone  In the mill of her jaws it went crunch crunch crunch  As the juices flowed out she went munch munch munch  Little dreaming that trouble and danger impended  She took her siesta when dinner was ended  No company present she knew but the dead  In perfect composure she nodded her head  Thus she sat till the moonlight with fitful gleam  Peered in thro the glass of the crystal stream  Here it shone on a bundle of sculls pickd bare  There it fell on a tissue of tangled hair  On a fragment glanced of some knights bright armour  Who had fallen a prey to the treacherous charmer  And the moonlight gave all a sepulchral hue  Through the waving green as it flickered through  The foul creature starts in a tremor awakes  Is it the wind that too boisterously shakes  The tremulous cords of her watergirt dome  Or is it the voice of her crimes coming home  She looks up in affright through a fearful chasm  Twas enough to bring on quite a nervous spasm  Down comes the water rushing and roaring  From the roof of her cell in a torrent pouring  But since witches can swim what in this to appal  Why perhaps no great deal but this was not all  Riding down on the wave like a ship in a gale  The bright moonbeams illuming his coat of mail  Came the winged knight shed once thought of entrapping  And who now in return had just caught her napping   At last at your bidding Im come dame quoth he  The Siren looked blue but no word spoke she  Then they meet in as loving collision I trow  As when flint strikes on steel or fire falls on tow  For the hub bub around them they care not a rush  The waters may roar and the waters may gush  The once airproppd dome all to pieces may shiver  Then struggling they rise on the breast of the river  The knight swam like a drake the witch like a duck  Or the Old Ones dam but the Old Ones own luck  Will now and then fail like the luck of a sinner  And the witch by ill luck had made too good a dinner  Indigestion surprise and some sickening alarms  Of terrorstruck conscience unnerved her strong arms  Her foul bloated body now sank and now rose  While a scratch for a thrust she returned the hard blows  That came pattering like hail on her tough old hide  As her mailclad opponent his falchion plied  Till the moon had gone down did the battle last  When the game was up the beldame was cast  As a Siren she troubled the world no more  But a charmed life by worse luck she bore  And with small change of manners and little of feature  Was transformed to a Spider a dark cunning creature  That beneath running waters constructs a dry cell  Where through summer and winter shes wont to dwell  While the knight gainst whose prowess her sorceries failed  Is the Great Water Beetle amphibious and mailed  Ye lovers of marvel and fairy lore  Say not that the days of enchantment are oer  That the wellsprings of Taney and Table fail  Tor they water the realms whence weve drawn our tale  There are streamlets yet where the riversprite  With his Harlequin changes bewilders the sight  There are castles yet of ivory and gold  Hung with floral fabrics by sunshine unrolld  Within whose luxurious recesses recline  Tays of exquisite form quaffing exquisite wine  Some in gossamer veiled of ethereal dyes  Which have only their match in the rainbow d skies  Some in richest and softest of velvets arrayed  Or in mail that does shame to the armourers trade  These are haunting us ever for ill or for good  Through earth and through air field forest and flood  To transport our thoughts as by magic spell  From the sordid objects whereon they dwell  To a land of the Marvellous dimly displayed  Where the lightwinged Fancy by wonder stayed  Still delighteth to hover and joyously say   Oh my darling elves yere not chased away   Theres a region still where ye have a place   The mysterious world of the Insect race  it it mailflair   Let no presuming impious railer tax  Creative wisdom as if ought was formd  In vain or not for admirable ends  Leigh Hunt tells us in his Indicator that an Italian Jesuit  Giulio Cordara has written a Poem upon Insects which he  begins by insisting that those troublesome and abominable  little animals were created only for our annoyance and that  they were certainly not inhabitants of Paradise Now we  scarcely know what to think of the good Fathers notion except  that it was hatched probably under a swarm of Mosquitos or  under dread of Scorpion or Tarantula Tis certain that the  flowers even of Paradise must have wanted a charm without  the basking Butterfly and humming Bee while on the other  hand we can hardly imagine the leaves of Adams garden ever  to have been gnawed by tooth of Caterpillar or that the  worm i the bud ever preyed on the unexpanded cheeks of his  damask roses still less that the fair fingers of our common  mother were ever when employed to cull or train them in  danger of being wounded by the poisoned dart of a Bee lurker  We have indeed the authority of our mighty Milton for sup  posing that across the threshold of Eves bower where   Underfoot the violet  Crocus and hyacinth with rich inlay  Broidered the ground more coloured than with stone  Of costliest emblem other creature there  Beast bird insect or worm durst enter none  Such was their awe of man  But from this it must not be inferred that their entrance  would have been dangerous but that their absence was essential  to the strict retirement of that blest retreat To meet then  the supposition that nothing save what was gentle and unin  jurious existed before mans fall we must needs conclude in  harmless speculation that the first Butterflies knowing no  Caterpillar youth were created Butterflies from the beginning  to sport over roses without thorns and that the first race of  Bees were formed stingless to collect their nectiferous harvest  from Cassia nard and balm that wilderness of sweets  without a bitter A Bee without a sting is not bytheway  even now a creature of imagination Huber their celebrated  historian having received a present of some such from Mexico  Constituted thus of harmless nature we may suppose the  earliest use of Insects like that of birds and other creatures to  have chiefly consisted in the forming each according to its  measure and degree various fitting receptacles of that life and  happiness which it was then as now the great purpose and  pleasure of their Creator to bestow Pilling their assigned  place in the book of Nature they were also no doubt made to  perform an essential part in the divine instruction of our first  parents  Spite therefore of our Jesuits fleabitten theology we may  fairly infer that amongst the creeping and flying things of  first creation Insects were included and that the vernal airs  of Eden were no desert airs for lack of a glittering mul  titude of ever joyous sporters in the sun and shade Even for  uses economic who can say but that in addition to   Fruits of all kinds in coats  Rough or smooth rind or bearded husk or shell 3  and juice of grape and dulcet cream of almonds the  grassy breakfastboard of Eve might not have been furnished  with honey purer than was ever collected in Narbonne or  on Hymettus Indeed if honey was ever stored at all by the  Bees of Paradise it must have been rather for the use of man  than for their own since to amass a winters provision would  have been labour lost in a clime where reigned eternal  spring At all events we read repeatedly of honey as  secondary to milk alone amongst the flowing bounties of the  Promised Land and throughout the nations of antiquity  sacred and profane the busy communities of Bees seem to have  held in those of the human race a degree of importance which  sufficiently attests their value as taxgatherers on the vegetable  kingdom  iknd why were Bees immortalised in the verse of Yirgil  except on the same principle as that which led man to deify  his brother man It was wholly for their usefulness since  there is little doubt that but for their important economic  service their own wonderful economy would have been as much  overlooked as it was misapprehended Ants it is true with  no such claim upon human notice attracted it scarcely less  witness the ancient records of their wars but these are com  paratively recent and it is likely that the marvels of Apian  monarchies first led to observation of the ways and wonders of  Pismire Republics  Of the value of honey and its extensive use we in our own  country and our own times since the introduction of sugar  can have seldom perhaps entertained anything like a just notion   a much lower estimate at all events than the Ukraine  peasant with his 400 or 500 beehives or a Spanish priest  possessor of 5000  About the uses of wax a word byandby but with the  aroma of honey in our nostrils and its flavour on our lips let us  think whether we are indebted to Insects for any other des  cription of palative luxury Why no say those who have  only lived and looked at home but they who have been at  Eome may tell us that snails are there commonly sold and  eaten especially as Lenten food Well but snails are not  Insects true though they were once so considered but we  have only to go back to the commencement of the Christian era  and we shall find that while John the Baptist was subsisting  in the desert of Judea upon the simple and ordinary fare of   locusts and wild honey imperial luxurious Eome was  regaling in her banquet halls upon veritable Insects luscious  Caterpillar grubs fattened on flour as we fatten oysters upon  meal This was the Cossus of Pliny and supposed identical  with the unsightly wooddevouring larva of the great Goat  Moth a lurid red and yellowish Caterpillar bulky black  headed and blackclawed a darkling dweller in the trunk of oak  or willow of which in due season we have much more to tell  Again without going back at all into remote ages we have  only to go east and west north and south into countries which  now brought near by the power of steam are remote no longer  and we shall still find men in daily commission of what to the  narrow ken of prejudice may seem the enormity of Insecteating  thereto incited in one quarter by the caprice of Epicurean  luxury in another by the united pressure of indolence and  scarcity The two extremes of society civilized and barbarous  are here brought together in one common habit See in the  West Indies the French planter gourmand and sometimes the  English as his copyist seated at his luxurious table oiling  the hinges of his wornout appetite with those lumps of insect  fatness known as the grubs of the Palm Weevil and then turn  to the poor degraded Hottentot squatted on the arid ground  swallowing by handfuls White Ants roasted washed down by  Locust soup or just as often too hungry or too indolent to  dress them devouring the uncooked Insects  But after all none can pronounce these AcridopAagi or  Locusteaters as monsters of singularity in their mode of diet  Was not the Locust after its kind expressly allowed for  food by the Mosaic Law and from the time of its institution  even to the present does not the law of Nature ever kind and  provident permit this insect scourge of humanity to be con  verted into a medium of supporting human life Since in all  countries a prey to their ravages in Syria Arabia Persia  Ethiopia Egypt and Barbary locusts are still an article of  provision in more or less extensive use And from what  but prejudice arises our disgust at Insectfeeding P Our king  Jamie of pedantic memory was said to have pronounced  him a vera valiant man who first adventured on eating  oysters and truly we opine that he must have been quite as  much a hero in his way as the dweller in Surinam or the  Mauritius who first engulfed a fat Palm Weevil grub  Why should the Frenchman wiping his mouth after Snail soup  mans omnivorous appetite  laugh at the Chinaman smacking his lips after a dish of Silk  worm chrysalides Shrimpeaters as we are why should we  stare at the locustfeeding Ethiop or Arab and why should he  who has supped off roasted crabs despise a New Caledonian  for seasoning his breakfast with a relish of roasted Spiders  Instead of thanking our stars for our own discriminating  taste let us then rather thank Providence for that omnivorous  appetite common to our race Herein let us recognise a dis  tinguished provision by which our brother man when located  in barren lands or overtaken by accidental scarcity is enabled  to draw supplies from almost every department of nature  We only marvel that Gastronomy than whom even Necessity  herself can scarcely boast a more numerous progeny of inven  tions and resources should not in the demand of her votaries  for new modes have been led to seek more frequently for new  materiel out of the Insect Kingdom This however may be  reserved for some future time Cockchafers and Chafer grubs  may yet become articles for the London springmarket and  Pates de Sauterelles may yet have a place in second courses  The idea is not Utopian neither is it new for Dr Darwin  long ago recommended the former as a delicate addition to the  list of entremets and the Eev Mr Shepherd who himself  dared to venture on the thing unknown pronounced the large  Green Grasshopper to be excellent And why not Pull of  sweet vegetable juices fresh imbibed and in some cases as in  Aphides scarcely altered wherefore should Insects in the shape  of diet be viewed with abhorrence and disgust and that  forsooth by coarse shamblefed animals living upon stallfed  oxen and styfed swine  Insects once occupied a place as important as herbs in the  list of sovereign remedies To take a Woodlouse or Mille  pedes perhaps alive and conveniently selfrolled for the occa  sion was as common as to take a vegetable pill Five Gnats  were administered with as much confidence as three grains of  calomel In an alarming fit of cholic no visitor with a dram  of peppermint could have been more cordially welcomed or  swallowed than a Ladybird Flywater was eyewater and  even that watershunning monster Hydrophobia was urged to  lap aqua pur a by the administration of a dry Cockchafer  Like other dogs and drugs these have all had their day in the  world of medicine but have left behind them that salutary  biter the Cantharides or Spanish Fly of Europe and the  Meloe Chicorei used by the natives of the Celestial Empire for  the same purpose of drawing off terrestrial humours  When from inward remedies and regalements we turn to  outward adornments we are instantly reminded of our obli  gations to those spinning millions   That in their green shops weave the smoothhaired silk  But stay are we indeed debtors to those busy insectartificers  who by furnishing material for velvet robes and silken gowns  and silken banners have ministered so largely to the pride of  the eye and the pride of life May not the Silkworm be  ranked rather among the dangerous than the useful gifts of  nature We think not for assuredly if Silkworms and silk  had never been some other production how coarse soever  would have served just as well to keep human vanity alive and  warm In ancient times that lightwinged passion nestled  quite as snugly in the folds of fine linen and the same fact is  sufficiently attested by modern instances To say nothing of  handkerchiefs those laced and broidered abominations  displayed by our countrywomen in token of a human infirmity  we may notice those curiously wrought stockings of Lisle  thread for which enormous prices have been given and  which prove clearly enough that the feet of Eves daughters  can be tangled quite as easily in vanitynets of vegetable  growth as in those of the worms weaving  How entirely conventional has been the value attached to  silk apparel Montaigne gives us in his Essays a striking  instance Speaking of the worse than uselessness of sump  tuary laws to restrain the luxury of dress which by making  it an exclusive badge of rank they rather tended to encourage  he recommends for the much more effectual repression of  expensive indulgences the adoption by princes and nobles of  the simplest habits both of dress and living which would then  forthwith become the mode in most repute In support of  this position he adduces the contempt into which silk dresses  fell on the following occasion When says he in conse  quence of the mourning for King Henry II cloth was ordered  to be worn at court for a year so low did silk fall in every  bodys estimation that whosoever continued to wear it was set  down at once as a lowborn cit In short les habits de soie  were entirely abandoned to surgeons and physicians  Be it also remembered that though silken sheen has  been always considered by us of Europe an article more or less  of luxury in Asia it has been for ages one of absolute use  While at Borne silk was valued at its weight in gold and the  Emperor Aurelian refused his Empress a silken robe because  it was too dear the lean unwashed artificer of China was  in some provinces clothed in his silken garment To the latter  country under the name of Serica has been attributed the  discovery of weaving Silkworm threads whence the Latin  holosericum or silken garment of which the first is said to  have been worn by the Emperor Heliogabalusf In the days  of Solomon we are told a woman named Pamphila of the  Island of Cos was skilled in the art of making cloth from this  country of Serica or China Du Halde says that the most  ancient of the Chinese writers ascribe the invention to one of  the women of the Emperor Hoang Ei named Silung and so  important was the discovery held that all the women in the  Emperors Palace were employed in rearing the worms and  weaving their productions Nor indeed could the Chinese  have valued silk too highly either as an article of home use or  as a very principal one of commerce before it was cultivated  and manufactured in other countries  The eggs of the Silk worm are said to have been first brought  from India to Europe about the year 550 by two monks who  having concealed them in hollow canes introduced them at  Constantinople from whence they reached Italy That country  became then the grand European emporium for silk both raw  and manufactured In the reign of Henry YI there was a  company of silk women in England but these are supposed to  have been only needleworkers in silken thread our supply of  the broad manufacture not coming from Italy till 1489 About  1520 the French with Milanese workmen manufactured but  did not cultivate and in 1547 silk in France was still  scarce and dear Its cultivation was introduced into that  kingdom by Henri Quatre contrary to the opinion of Sully  Our James the First was no less earnest for its culture in  England and in 1608 vainly urged it from the throne  Twenty years later the silk manufactories of Britain had become  very considerable these were further improved by French work  men driven hither by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes  still more so by the invention of the silkthrowing machine at  Derby in 1719 and by 1730 we are told that even in Italy  the English silks bore a higher price than the Italian At  the present time although we import of silk goods very largely  we also export of the same even to countries which come in  competition with our own Our exports of these commodities  to France Germany and Italy were estimated in 1843 at the  value of near Â£200000 and in 1844 the quantity of raw silk  consumed at 4431812 lbs  Silk of late years so considerably cheapened will doubtless  be soon further reduced by our new relations with the  Celestial Empire and our present system of unrestricted trade  Who can tell but that silken gowns lowered as they already  are to within the tiptoe reach of the Million may not when  yet more accessible be fairly trampled on by the aristocratic  few  As connected with outward apparel as well as various other  arts of ornament our next obligation to Insects is for dyes  Cochineal which until the year 1694 was believed in Europe  to be a seed is now known by putting a few grains in warm  water to be an Insect a Coccus or wingless Beetle something  resembling in form those commonly found on the leaves of  grapevines and of the hawthorn It is a native of China and  other parts of Asia where the nopal or the prickly pear on  which it feeds is indigenous Of the great importance of  this Insect production as an article of commerce we may form  an idea from the recorded facts that the East India Company  offered a reward of Â£6600 for its introduction into India and  that some years ago the annual consumption probably much  increased in Great Britain alone was reckoned at 750 bags  worth Â£375000  Another species of Coccus found on the evergreen oak in  the south of Europe and Asia has furnished from the earliest  ages a bloodred crimson dye supplanted now by the CochineaL  It was known to the Phceniceans under the name of Tola to  the Greeks under that of Coccus to the Arabians and Persians  under that of Kermes or Alkermes Kirby suggests that this  was the dye probably used for the Tabernacle curtains then  serving for awhile to heighten the Pagan splendors of Greece  and Rome it returned once more to sacred uses in the scrip  tural figures of the Brussels and Plemish tapestries  Lac called either stick seed or shelllac according to its  state of preparation is the secretion of another sort of Coccus  found on various Indian trees and is used also as a red dye  but more extensively in varnishes japan and sealingwax  An African species of Mite is also used as a dye from  whence it has been suggested to try for the same purpose that  brilliant little Insect the scarletsatin Mite so common a fre  quenter of our gardens in early summer  But of all Insect productions none perhaps is more useful  none certainly more interesting than wax The little Bee her  self might verily become inflated with selfimportance could she  be aware of the exalted and varied purposes to which this pro  duct of her labours is applied by man How greatly is the reli  gious pageantry of the Roman catholic countries of Europe and  America indebted for much of its splendor and for more than  half perhaps of its influence on the mind dazzled through  the eye to the giant tapers of their sacred edifices each the  tribute of a thousand flowers collected and transmuted by a  thousand Bees Of all substances for the illumination of holy  fanes wax certainly is the most appropriate so sweet so pure  and in its origin leading back the thoughts to beautiful fields  and groves and gardens But through the groves which were  Gods first temples the intercepted sunbeams cast but a   dim religious light neither perhaps in temples made with  hands is an excess of illumination most in harmony with meek  devotion when from the spiritual darkness within and around  best typified by a measure of surrounding gloom it would  humbly look upwards towards the source and centre of all  light created or revealed In the halls of festive splendour no  less conspicuously though less appropriately shines the produce  of the Bees rustic labour Or walk we along the streets or  enter the lounges for amusement does not waxen imagery  from the shaven BlueBeards and pink Fatimas of the barbers  window to the noted and notorious of the earth the monarchs  and the murderers of Madame Tussauds show remind us of  the busy Insects who w r ere the first w r orkers of the plastic paste  Nor among the curious works of art whose basis is this work  of nature must we overlook the waxen flowers which in their  fadeless bloom and exquisite imitative beauty bring a garden  in all but perfume within the walls of the Pantheon This is  an interesting as well as elegant use of the rifled riches of  buds and bells thus paid back by perpetuation of their  fleeting loveliness It is needless to enumerate a variety of  other uses to which wax is applied for they are every where  apparent even in the comfortless dryrubbed floor of the French  hotel or chateau and the single mahogany table valued heir  loom of the English cottage wherein the housewife is fur  nished by the Bees industry with a mirrored reflection of her  own  Sealingwax as at present manufactured is only wax in name  being composed of gum or shelllac and turpentine coloured  with vermillion but in former times it was wax in nature and  even now the great seal of the Lord Chancellor and others of  official use are of veritable wax  Shakespeares Imogine when opening her husbands letter  is made to say   Good wax thy leave Blessed be  Yon Bees that make these locks of counsel  and in the next century Fuller thus speaks of wax and its uses   This is the cask where honey is the liquor and being yellow  by nature is by art made white red and green which I take to  be the dearest colour especially appendent on parchment  Wax is good by day and night useful in law instruments to  seal and in physic The ground and foundation of all cerecloth  cera is also made of wax  Much more extensive and important than any of the fore  going but as less palpable even more disregarded are the  general uses of Insect existence Disease engendered of cor  ruption in substances animal and vegetable would defy all the  precautions of man unless these were aided by scavenger  Insects those myriads of Mies and carrion Beetles whose per  petual labours even in our tempered climate but infinitely more  so in warmer regions are essentially important to cleanliness  and health  A use of this nature and one performed perhaps to an  extent we little think of is the purification of standing waters  by the innumerable Insects which usually inhabit them We  have witnessed ample proof of the efficacy in this respect of  Gnat Larvae when keeping them to observe their transfor  mations Water swarming with these Lives of Buoyancy  has been perfectly sweet at the end of ten days while that  from the same pond containing only vegetable matter has  become speedily offensive  As commissioned agents ministering more or less directly to  our various pleasures we owe no slender obligation to Insects  Besides imparting variety and animation to summer scenes  by their ceaseless hum and endless diversity of form they  assist in the support of most of our favourite songsters of the  garden and the grove The red breast the wren and the tit  mouse live almost wholly upon worms and Insects which also  serve the blackbird and the thrush as meat before a fruit  desert To the delicacies of our tables they are also indirect  contributors Our game grows plump on the nurselings of  the Anthill the larvae and pupae improperly called eggs  Our fish fatten on the My in all its varieties and even  our poultry thrive all the better especially ducks and turkeys  for a sprinkle of Caterpillars Plies and Spiders as a relish  with their ordinary food  The aid afforded by Bees and other Insects in the propagation  of various flowers by conveying on their hairy backs the pollen  of one to the stigma of another is no secret to the botanist  and gardeners know something and ought to know still  more of the value of certain tribes of insecteating Insects as  checks upon the vegetable ravagers of their own race Both  the gardener and the hopgrower would find it worth their  while to keep up standing armies of Ladybird redcoats against  the Aphis legions which ravage their plantations and parterres  Lacewinged Plies and Syrphus Grubs are worthy of all en  couragement for the same important service and as remarked  by Southey the more Spiders in the stable the less would horses  suffer from the Plies  But neither from the above nor from any other known benefits  are we to measure the usefulness of the Insect creation as con  nected with other orders of being A remark of Curtis on the  apparently superfluous productions of the vegetable world is  equally applicable to those of the Insect kingdom Speaking  of a certain watergrass air a aquatica very common in boggy  meadows and found to be entirely useless for cattle he justly  observes that we ought not to look on this or any other plant  as made in vain because we do not immediately see its purpose  This grass is plucked by various waterfowls and no less than  five species of Mies musci were produced from a few handfuls  of its seeds which when I gathered it were doubtless in the  chrysalis state How little do we know of natures productions  We have already pointed out the utility of Insects in affording  ever new subjects of interesting inquiry And let those who  will look scorn upon our pursuit we repeat that few when  followed aright are more adapted to improve the mind In its  minute details it is well calculated to give habits of observation  and of accurate perception while as a whole the study of this  department of nature so intimately linked with others above  and below it has no common tendency to lift our thoughts ta  the great Creative Source of being to Him who has not  designed the minutest part of the minutest object without  reference to some use connected with the whole  ON APHIDES   A feeble race yet oft   The sacred sous of vengeance  But what sort of insects are Aphides demands perhaps a  reader who is no entomologist In plain English they are  Plantlice But what are Plant lice is the question put by  another who is no observer of nature Let us inquire in reply  what is a Wasp a Spider a Butterfly Did you ever happen to  notice one of those remarkable creatures W ell then we can  tell you that for every single Butterfly you have seen a  thousand Aphides and for every score of Wasps a million of  Plantlice Not only have yon seen bnt scarcely a summers  day has passed without your having destroyed them by dozens  Your foot annihilates them on the grass They die by your  hand on almost every flowersprig you gather and with every  vase of sweets which you place upon your table you consign  them without a thought to the bitter death of famine so  important and fatal is the influence which you and everybody  are continually exercising over the destinies of Aphis existence  little as you would seem to known about it although perhaps  you may be better acquainted with it by sight than you are by  name However blind from indifference to the minutiae of  nature have you not often when about to pluck a rosebud or  a piece of honeysuckle almost started to find the one a green  mass of moving life the other with leaves green no longer  but turned black to the eye and clammy to the touch You  perceive in short that what most people call a blight but  what naturalists only look on as a swarm of Aphides has been  busy with your flowers before you and turn away disgusted  to seek for less contaminated sweets  To keep however to our blight Insects call them what we  will be it here noted that the popular belief concerning their  origin has of late years been assigned a place among popular  errors That  When the wind is in the east  Tis neither good for man nor beast  is an ancient saw too well supported by the modern instances  of cough lumbago catarrh and rheumatism to be disputed  but in common with other things and persons of ill repute the  treacherous East would seem to bear the burthen of other sins  besides its own In addition to the above acknowledged evils   that Death in the air which would seem to be really  borne upon the wings of this malicious wind it is popularly  accused of bringing Life in the air but in a form which to  the vegetable creation is quite as fully fraught with destruction  as are to the animal its poisonous invisible arrows Besides  these and almost as impalpable myriads upon myriads of Insect  eggs or as some have it minute Insects are supposed to float  in the blighting atmosphere whence falling in showers on the  verdant face of nature they soon become visible in the shape of  our Aphis marauders or of leaf destroying caterpillars With  the fact however that Insect eggs are heavier than water  the notion of their floating through the air is not quite accor  dant or granting that they float from whence they originally  came is still the posing question a question best answered  perhaps by the plain and probable inference adopted by  Bennie and other naturalists that neither our blight Insects  nor their eggs have ever been aerial travellers but that from  innumerable minute eggs laid in autumn on the trunks or  branches of tree or shrub or upon some adjacent objects they  emerge almost simultaneously in spring Their amazing  number is sufficiently accounted for when we find by the cal  dilations of Reaumur that one Aphis may be the progenitor of  5904900000 descendants  The above which is the least difficult method certainly of  accounting for the presence of these Insect swarms would  seem also the most easily ascertainable yet the popular theory  of their being windconveyed has had its advocates among the  learned as well as its believers among the simple Nor indeed is  it very unusual for learned theorists to go far and wide and  high and deep in search of truths which in nine cases out of ten  they could scarcely have failed to discover by looking a little  more closely into the things on which they are pleased to  speculate  Now suppose we do this with the leafbuds of a rosebush  which early as it is we shall find already occupied by Aphis  tenantry such as have recently emerged from minute black  eggs deposited last autumn on the branches These are all  green of small size and without wings but later towards the  end of May a single flowerbud is likely to present us with  two or three kinds of these infesting sapsuckers differing in  size form and colour We shall therefore venture to anti  cipate the appearance of summer rosebuds and with them  that of the numerous descendants which are sure by that  time to have sprung from the race of Aphides now in being  not as these from the egg but after the manner of viviparous  animals This may seem a strange anomaly but there are  things to tell of Aphis economy stranger still  Now for our blightdisfigured rosebud which instead of  encasing green and bursting red displays nothing but a  moving multitude a conglomeration of Plantlice which  taken en masse is certainly no pleasing object Por all this  the little winged animal which as being more conspicuous  than the bulk of its fellows we shall first single from among  them is no inelegant specimen of natures Lilliputian work  manship It has a plump shining body of deep bright green  spotted at the sides with black long slender legs inclining  to reddish and like a bamboo reed marked at every joint  with black or darkest brown The shoulders head and long  jointed antennae are also chiefly black as well as two diverging  spikelets proceeding from the back while a pair of ample  wings much longer than the body rise erectly over it  This pretty insect and those which resemble it look like the  aristocracy of the wingless multitude by which they are sur  rounded and though we cannot pronounce their pinions to  be borne as badges of rank we believe that no reason has as  yet been assigned with certainty for the partial distribution  among Aphis tribes of the organs of flight which do not with  them as with various other insects serve as a distinction  either of age or sex A cause indeed which if true is most  curious and interesting has been assigned for this difference  of endowment among Aphides It has been supposed to  depend on the quality and quantity of nourishment within  their reach those which in this respect are well provided on  juicy luxuriant shoot being wingless while those on a dry a  and sapless branch are gifted with pinions to waft them in  search of better provender Supposing this idea to be correct  we have herein another striking instance added to the many  of providing care in that Power which careth for all and  adapts for all the means to the exigence  If we examine now the wingless multitude the canaille  of our rosebud we shall find that the individuals which  compose it have shorter legs and flatter bodies than their  winged superiors and that they differ exceedingly in size from  one another Por the most part their colour is a light green  though some are of a pale red but however else they differ  all both winged and wingless are furnished with one remark  able appendage common to the whole Aphis tribe to whatever  plant peculiar from the lordly oak to the lowly briar This  is the haustellum trunk or suckingpipe appended beaklike  to the head and which consisting of a tube both pointed and  perforated serves the double purpose of piercing the leaf and  sucking its juices  The pipes of these our little ravagers of the rose are but as  beaklets compared with those of their brethren of the oak  yet they form we can tell you no despicable instruments of  destruction employed as they are by thousands in simultaneous  and incessant labour And this considered who can wonder at  the marvellous and unsightly changes the spoil and havoc  which these peaceful armies carry in their wake The leaf  whose surface when they take it in possession resembles a  smooth green plain or divided by intersecting veins a country  of verdant fields is presently warped and converted into barren  hills and arid dales by the extraction of its fertilizing sap  while the tender bud and vigorous shoot though differently  are equally distorted and desiccated by their operations   Tor the most part these Insect marauders living to eat and  to be eaten seem to have no other business no thought or  care except on the matter of supplies and take no trouble to  conceal their ranks from the observation of their numerous  enemies or even to shelter themselves from the stormy wind  and rain which sweep them off by millions That wellknown  blighter of the hopes of hopgrowers in common parlance  yclept the My albeit generally wingless is an open ravager  of this description feeding sometimes on the upper sometimes  on the under side of the leaf But to this general rule there  are numerous exceptions and a familiar instance of their  defensive works is to be met with on every Aphisblighted  currant bush Take one of those leaves so often seen bloated  by raised blisterspots of brownish red examine their answering  concavities beneath and within these snug recesses you will  intrude on as many social groups of Aphides using their pipes  in each separate divan  Some other species common on poplar lime c are pro  vided with places of assembly habitation and concealment of  a far more comfortable and complete description but of these  we shall have more to say byandby when speaking of Gall  insects among which they have been assigned a place  We have thus far been only looking at onr Lilliputian hosts  with reference to ourselves and to vegetables in their capacity of  destroyers but as connected with their own world of Insects  they play a more passive but very important part as providers  or furnishers of food a portion of which they may also be con  sidered as producing  Most of us have heard of honeydew and know probably  that it is a sweet clammy substance found on the leaves of  various trees and plants especially on the oak the vine the  hop and the honeysuckle As to the real nature of this sweet  poison to the plant opinions differ and some perhaps even of  the learned moderns know as much about it as did the learned  ancient Pliny who doubted whether to call it sweat of the  heavens saliva of the stars or a liquid produced by  purgation of the air Careful observation seems however  to have pretty clearly ascertained that this honeydew like the  honey of Bees of vegetable origin is extracted with the sap  secreted and then thrown out by the Aphides in a state of the  greatest purity Besides the profusion of sweets which they  scatter around them like sugarplums at a carnival they always  keep a good supply within the green jars of their bodies By  the lavish distribution of these saccharine riches our little  Aphides make for themselves it is true a few interested  friends while on the other hand they owe to their possession  a host of devouring enemies  Reaumur designates the race of Aphides as the very corn  sown for the use of their more powerful insect brethren but  as animate creatures as well as gregarious greenleaf grazers  they have been considered with more propriety as the oves and  loves the flocks and herds of those which seem permitted to  hold them in possession Foremost among these Aphidophagi  or feeders upon Aphides we must rank the Ladybird Inno  cent as she looks that misnamed Vache a Lieu instead of  grazing innocently on the fruits of the earth loves nothing  better than to stuff under her scarlet mantle carcass after  carcass of Aphis lamb or mutton Even before she puts on  the scarlet and while yet in her own tender youth she is if  possible still more given to inordinate excess in the same  living article of animal food In other words while she is yet  a flat lead coloured sixlegged Grub instead of a rotund  crimsonpainted beetle she fairly fattens upon Aphides  Wherever these abound whether in hopground beanfield or  rosary there are Ladybirds gathered together and in all such  places they do the cultivator more good by their united appetites  than he can do for himself by his utmost precautions against  the Ely Numerous are the winged tribes called Aphidi  vorous or Aphiseating Elies because in their first stage of  being and sometimes in their last it is with them at every  meal not toujours perdrix but toujour s puceron  Amongst this devouring crew is the beautiful goldeyed lace  winged Fly which while yet in its crawling minority roams  through its appropriated leafy fold making tremendous use of  its crooked and perforated tusks first to slaughter then to suck  in the sweet juices of its victims at the rate of two a minute  Of less ferocious aspect but not a whit less insatiate than the  above is the green or particoloured Grub of a Beelike Ely  called a Syrphus of which many varieties are common in  gardens darting from flower to flower or hovering hawklike  over them Applied closely to a leaf or stalk by their  hinder extremities which are broad and flattish the Grubs of  these Syrphi may in June be noticed by dozens on the  stretch for the Aphis prey by which they are usually sur  rounded In this attitude they much resemble Leeches and  like leeches are in greedy search of blood the honied blood  of their victims  The above are the most rapacious of those comparatively  bulky devourers that to the extensive benefit of vegetation  and of man appropriate Aphis flocks by wholesale but the  Aphis individual atom as he is is by no means so insignifi  cant as to escape individual attack Even the Aphis is great  enough to have a parasite One a small black Ichneumon Ely  pierces the little green body of the unconscious Sapsucker and  deposits therein a tiny egg from which springs a tiny worm  that feasts and grows to maturity within its living receptacle  We have also often noticed the Aphis of the plumtree and  others fastened on by another infester of a parasitic nature in  the shape of a bright scarlet Mite not to be detached from  the body of its victim so long as life remains  But enough of Aphis enemies and now for the friends  which as well as foes they owe to the possession of their  honied treasures We have hitherto seen our flocks of the leaf  appropriated as sheep for the slaughter but those to whom  this fact however new will appear nothing strange may smile  incredulous on being told that as milch kine they are  sometimes kept tended and even reared by insect proprietors  for the sake of the sweet milk the honeydew which  they afford In our history of Bairweather Friends  we have already adverted to this patriarchal practice and  have therefore only to remind our readers that it is exercised  among various tribes of economic Ants though the Yellow  Ant has been termed the greatest cowkeeper of them  all It may require some time and trouble to become  witnesses ourselves of this marvellous instance of Formic  economy already proved beyond a doubt by the observations  of others but everybody has an opportunity of noticing  that Ants and Aphides are held together by some bond of  union They are continually seen in company and a little  further scrutiny presently discovers that the Ants are the  followers of the Aphides and entirely for what they can get  out of them Last August the stalks of an elder shrub in  our garden were absolutely blackened at the joints by Elder  Aphides and among these were continually to be seen a multi  tude of brown Ants demanding and receiving their supplies of  honeydew as emitted by the former  Besides the general analogy which exists between flocks of  Aphides and flocks of sheep in their gentle nature their gre  garious habits and in their being appropriated so extensively  for food there may be noticed in several instances a curious  kind of external rapport between them and the woollycoated  quadrupeds  There are some species of Aphides which are actually  clothed with a sort of wool or down One of them a four  winged Gall insect is found in June or July on the poplar  or may be often noticed at that season flying or floating  about in the air like a small white tuft of down Another  hoarycoated Aphis is unfortunately too well known to apple  growers under the name of White Blight The branches of  those trees selected for their pasture by our insect sheep are  soon invested by their numerous fleeces with a hoary aspect  appearing in spring and increasing through the summer  These fleeces are found upon examination to consist of a woolly  or cottony substance exuded from the insects bodies and  under its cover a multitude of these wingless Aphides are  incessantly at work with their destructive pipes sucking up  the sweet vital juices of the tree the old and the young being  thus employed together parents with their offspring to whom  this soft down serves the purpose of a cradle This lani  gerous vesture says Mr Knapp serves not only to convey  the creature from tree to tree throughout the orchard but  also in autumn winds becomes a vehicle for its destruction  many being borne away by their fleeces to perish far from their  parent stem Those which are left to abide the winter are  protected from its rigour partly by torpor and partly by a short  downy cloathing with which their bodies are invested under  the long one before described  Let us conclude our Article on Aphides with a few  distinguishing traits of their personal character and peculiar  physiology Character say you what scope for the display  of character in a little denizen whose world is comprised in a  single leaf or fiowerbud who is born but to eat and be  eaten Why it is with reference to the latter point that  very law of its existence which condemns it to be eaten that  our little Aphis exhibits a notable pattern in the virtue of  passive endurance and submission to the decrees of fate  Never did Turk bend his neck to the bowstring or rush upon  the scimitar with more perfect composure and nonchalance  than does our lamb of the leaf submit itself to the murderous  jaws of its lionlike or wolflike destroyers seeming perfectly  at ease and enjoying life to the last bite or sup while its  merciless slaughterers are heaping up carcasses around One  of their devourers indeed the Grub or Larva before men  tioned of the lacewinged Ply seems to play the part of a  wolf in sheeps clothing dressing itself up in the skins of the  slain but as the composure of the Aphis flock appears equally  undisturbed where no such disguise is put on it would be  unfair to suppose they are deceived into philosophy But  perhaps say you they are not aware of the presence of their  enemies Possibly not but yet they seem to have the same  organs of perception as other victimized insects which under  the same circumstances generally testify alarm and make  vigorous efforts to escape  The Aphis has another singular habit springing apparently  out of the same sort of perception that it is right to die quietly  like a greatminded little Insect just as Caesar who to fall  like a great monarch of men covered his face with his mantle   or as the lion which to die like a great monarch of beasts  retires into some thicket or den obscure We have spoken  already of the Ichneumon the little Ply which deposits a  single egg in a single Aphis hereupon to use the words of  Kirby the body of the victim swells and becomes smooth  though still full of life Those thus pricked separate from  their companions and taJce their station on the under side of  the leaf After some days the Grub hatched from the en  closed egg pierces the body of the Aphis and attaches the  margin of the orifice to the leaf by silken threads Upon this  it dies becomes white and resembles a brilliant bead or pearl  Every Aphiscovered roseleaf will furnish instances of what  is here described  There is yet another peculiarity which distinguishes the  Aphis from perhaps every other creature in the animal world  a physical enigma about which the divers into natures secrets  long puzzled their heads in vain until at last a clever patient  Frenchman hit upon what is considered its solution  Now when you see in spring or early summer a group of  Aphides a group of leaves covered with them or even a group  of trees which they have made their own it is certain at least  we can answer for the fact on good authority that in all the  multitude on which you cast your eye you will be looking  on none but Aphides whether winged or wingless of the  feminine gender Where then are the lords of these nume  rous ladies is a question you very naturally ask Why they  are not in existence and never have been The ladies may have  had fathers they have children to be seen like chickens busy  with their bills around them but with perfect truth and with  out a shadow of imputation on their spotless characters they  neither have nor ever have had husbands  Now suppose all the elderly matrons presiding over this  assembly to have gone the way of all flesh of Aphides and  that you are looking on a similar company composed of their  immediate descendants Still presenting the same remarkable  deficiency if deficiency it be of masculine members this  assemblage will consist entirely of the daughters and grand  daughters of the defunct and as not one of these though each  in her turn is pretty sure to become a mother can ever boast  a son so it goes on even to the tenth generation  Suppose lastly that in September or October you fall in  with another company of Aphides regaling on an autumn rose  branch If so prithee pluck it and let us scrutinize together  the assembly by which it is occupied for being probably the  tenth or last generation it is likely to contain at length some  of the lords of this curious creation Aye now we have them  here amongst the green petticoats are some individuals  distinguished by surtouts some of bright yellow some of  orange some of soberbrown colours worn in accordance it  is said with their youth middle or advanced age All these   Mercuries wear wings but even their pinions assume  with equal propriety a corresponding hue deepening from  white to transparent black according to the period of their  wearers standing Might not our evergreen beaux for  evergreen belles are privileged even by example of feminine  Aphides take a hint from these sensibly clad seniors of the  sapsucking race Perhaps however it is scarcely fair to  quote as patterns in anything such outoftheway creatures as  those we are describing strangest of animals but especially  in the paternal character The Insect race is celebrated for  having numerous progenies but these our patriarchal pucerons  are far superior to all the rest They are no fathers of  ten in family nor of twenty nor of twenty times twenty but  marvel of multiplication each of these sires can boast of  being the actual parent of ten generations all save the last  made up of daughters You who doubt whether this is true  or may desire to know how it has been proved we refer to  the scientific pages of Bonnet Trembley Bichardson Bennie  and a host of other unimpeachable authorities  We have to subjoin an important if authentic addendum  to the history of Aphis life  From observations made in the summer of 1846 it was  concluded by Mr Alfred Smee that the originating cause of  the potatoblight was the preternatural abundance of the  Aphis vastator By this Insect is occasioned says he the  first injury to the vegetables it attacks and it is thus the  cause of the disease from which the subsequent changes take  place The Vastator attacks many plants and kills whatever it  attacks It destroys the potato spinach turnip carrot  beetroot clover and it will even live upon wheat  To causes merely atmospheric such as absence of summer  sunshine and the prevalence of rain have been likewise ascribed  by most competent authorities the potato murrain It has  also been assigned to the presence of Fungi in the tubers t  but if indeed the Aphis vastator may be regarded as the root  of the evil more properly the evil of the root it confers  assuredly on its tiny tribe a grave importance which none can  be inclined to dispute when they cast a backward glance on  the face of Europe dwelling chiefly on that island blot  unhappy Ireland  The feeble race 99 of Aphides is in truth not to be despised  as an agent of disfigurement and devastation though their  injurious powers have probably been overrated Even in  poetic justice it is hardly perhaps admissible to call them  sons of vengeance after having seen in their appointed  destroyers the sons of mercy 99 sent for counteraction of their  mischief We would rather at all events in bidding farewell  to these myriads of the leaf contemplate them under a more  agreeable aspect as recipients namely of life and enjoyment  living only so far as concerns their insect brethren to imbibe  and to impart of sweets  INSECT SENSES   In the nice Bee what sense so subtly true  From poisonous herbs extracts the healing dew  This lovely springtime has brought round a grand festival  a feast of the Senses which seated as sisters at natures  bounteous board are now being specially regaled each with a   dainty dish peculiarly suited to her liking  The Sight now banquets on the vernal landscape as day by  day the trees put on fresh tints of beauty and as   Daisies pied and violets blue  And cuckoobuds of yellow hue  Do paint the meadows with delight  Not less richly fares the Hearing as it now drinks in the  melodies of spring the music of happy birds the hum of  newborn insects the whisper of opening leaves the morning  hymn of nature fresh awakened  Spring odours rising meanwhile from foliage from flower  and from field regale as gloriously the sense of Smell And  Taste fails not to come in also for her share of new  delights yet is she perhaps of all her sister senses among  whom she is the least refined the one least specially treated in  this pure and delicate banquet of the spring The pleasures  of taste accordingly are now less actual than anticipative  pleasures enjoyed through the promise of advancing vegetable  and of budding or flowering fruittree  Again not with one simple viand but with a delicious  compound the Feeling which we shall venture to call a sense  general derived from all others quivers with new delight as  spring influences send the blood dancing through our frames  like the rivulets so lately frostbound careering through the  flowery meadows  Such is the grand springfestival of the senses and shall we  towards whom these sisters five or seven are employed to  do the honours of such a banquet sit down or rise from the  repast without a grace rendered to the Great Provider of   Dr Virey divides the senses into three intellectual viz sight hearing and  the internal sense of thought and four physical viz touch love taste and  smell  the feast Do not these very senses each lead us directly to  the payment of such befitting homage  The eye is it not the crystal window through which mind  looks out and communicates with nature and shall intellect  the eye of the spirit be content to rest on natural things  without rising by aid of its corresponding organ to things  divine Shall the ear bring us delight in the sweet har  monies of spring without our hearing amidst and above them  all an invocation to unite with heart and voice in the chants  of universal praise Shall we inhale the pleasant fragrance  dispersed by perfumes of the earth the incense of the groves  Gods first temples and not offer therewith the more  acceptable incense of a grateful spirit Shall the feeling of  this reviving springtime pervade our frames and even lightly  touch upon our hearts yet there stop short short of that  inmost sanctuary where within our heart of hearts if a  fitting tabernacle the Source of Life himself does not disdain  to dwell  With ourselves then this feast of the senses should be but  an antepast to a banquet more refined an avenue to higher  delights a fleeting image of pleasures which abide for ever  but looking around us we see at the same bounteous table  myriads of fellowpartakers with whom the pleasures of sense  would seem to constitute the sum total of their happiness  That among these insects are endowed with senses like  our own is now almost universally acknowledged and that  they may possess besides other resembling gifts of which we  can form no precise notion has been not improbably conjec  tured though doubt still attaches to the seat of some of  the organs by which they are exercised This is by no means  the case however with the instruments of sight which in  most insects are sufficiently obvious A child can point to the  eyes of a Ply or Bee as readily as to those of an ox and though  the child judges only by analogy of position and of form  dissection and experiment have alike induced the natural  philosopher to assign the name and office of eyes to those large  brown reticulated bodies which in the said Ply or Dronebee  are seen occupying the greater portion of the head Besides  these the same insects and most others are provided with  three smaller eyes termed ocelli which resemble shining  points and which are usually placed in the form of a triangle  above and between the larger pair  We find therefore that both as respects the size and number  of their visual organs Insects have greatly the advantage over  all other animals at present known amongst which there is  not one which can boast of five much less of eight eyes or of  twenty the complement bestowed upon the Spider and the  Centipede  We are by no means however to set it down for granted  on this account that every insect is a little eagle or Argus in  power and quickness of vision for their many eyes would  sometimes seem to serve them like the hares many friends  or like the many servants by whom we are often worse waited  on than by a few All that we can pronounce on with any  certainty is this that the gift of sight as well as of every other  sense conferred on insects is adequate to the exigences of their  nature for the rest the closest observers are much at variance  The Bee for instance which is supposed by Huber to possess  the faculty of seeing in the greatest perfection and chiefly by  means of this surpassing vision to be enabled to retrace its way  to its own hive is yet denominated by one poet t a dimeved  creature while another with reference to the eye writes of   Its orb so full its vision so confined  Poets it is true are not always the best authorities on points  of Natural History on which often overstepping the fair bounds  of poetic licence they are apt enough to mislead rather than  instruct Yet as regards this matter of the sight of Bees the  poets above cited are in no want of scientific opinions at least as  many on their side as on the opposite Wildman and Drs Bevan  and Evans all consider the sight of the Bee as somewhat imper  fect and more adapted for distant vision than for near enabling  them indeed to fly straight homewards through the trackless  air as if in full view of their hive but then permitting them to  run their heads against it seeming to feel their way to the  door with their antennae as if totally blind And yet  again according to Beaumur they ought to be no such  gropers because as his experiments would seem to prove  their eyes are of two kinds the two large ones being adapted  for distant and horizontal vision the three smaller at the top  of the head serving for that which is near and upwards  One of the most curious peculiarities observable in insect  eyes in those of them at least which are large and conspi  cuous is their compound construction Their cornea or  outer coat instead of being smooth is numerously divided  into what are called facets each of itself a little perfect eye  Of these a Butterfly has been assigned in each compound  organ 17335 a Dragon My 12544 a House My 7000  Possessing such a multitude of eyes or eyelets under one it  might seem that of every single object Insects must be pre  sented with a multitude of images This however we have  no reason to suppose inasmuch as we with our pair of single  eyes are not in the habit of seeing double and as according  to Muller each individual facet of an insect s compound eye  can survey but a small space in the field of vision each only  contributes to the perception of all things within it Each  separate one does not at the same time see all such objects  but only conveys its impression to the nervous filament with  which it is supplied and the latter being united in the great  optic nerve a common and distinct image is ultimately  produced  The compound eye of an insect would not seem therefore   So it is said by Dr Hooke and others but Swammerdam did not consider  as such the numerous hexagonal divisions in the eye of the Bee  to multiply objects to its natural possessor but it has never  theless been converted by the ingenuity of man into a curious  optical instrument of multiplying power Through the eye  of a Elea so placed as to command objects with the assis  tance of a microscope a single soldier has appeared as at once  diminished and multiplied into a Lilliputian army while the  flame of a single candle has been made in like manner to  represent a grand miniature illumination  The eyes of Butterflies present on examination the ap  pearance of a multiplying glass of this description the facets  bearing a resemblance to a cut diamond The ocelli or simple  eyes appearing as little points of crystal seated mostly above  the compound pair and usually three in number are supposed  to be intended generally as well as in Bees for the purposes  of near vision such as examination of leaves flowers c  serving for food or presenting it in the smaller fry by  which they are frequented  The position of Insect eyes is in several cases worthy of  especial notice affording in their variations from the common  type so many remarkable instances of that kind creative care  which adapts each organ with exquisite nicety to its intended  use  In that little shining Beetle called the Whirlwig which may  be seen every summers day whirling about the surface of  smooth waters each of the eyes is as it were divided into  an upper and a lower half the one for looking up into the  air the other for looking down into the water Those of the  Harvest Spider are seated at the top of the head of all posi  tions the most convenient for a creature living chiefly among  grass or stubble In a common Spider the eyes which are  all of the simple kind are no less excellently calculated by their  varied positions front top and sideways for commanding  that range of sight so useful especially in the hunting tribes  for perception and seizure of their prey  While on the subject of Insect eyes we must notice one  more peculiarity which distinguishes them in appearance from  all others and this is their immovability with in most cases  seeming opacity The want of movement is as we have just  seen sufficiently made up to their possessors by means of  number and position but this characteristic of deathlike still  ness and deadness in that organ which in nearly all other  animals is most expressive of life and intelligence contributes  we fancy almost as much as their diminutive size to make us  underrate the intellectual powers of Insects and leads us to  refer the whole instead of a part only of their ways of wisdom  to the compulsory power of instinct This is but natural  Look at an Insect as we may it never appears to look at us  the little glazed windows whence mind peeps out and commu  nicates with other minds seem in it as it were darkened  Yet this after all is only an appearance and should not there  fore be allowed to influence our judgment as to the position  assignable to Insects in the intellectual scale of being To  this general character of dull opacity thus observable in the  eyes of Insects there are however a few exceptions though  these are none of the most pleasing sort  There is the eye as a larva of that Bugdestroyer albeit a  Bug himself the Reduvius joersonatus with its dark pupil and  bloodred iris illumined with a glare of fierceness And some  what resembling in colour and expression is that of the Scorpion  from the gaze of which if of augmented size we should recoil  with horror The golden eyes of the beautiful lacewinged  Ely the eyes painted in stripes of many of the GadFlies  the flowerlike eyes of another Insect an exotic are all beau  tiful varieties of the optic organ though in point of expression  they may rank no higher than the less ornamented instruments  furnished commonly to the Insect crew  Many species of nocturnal Moths sail through the dark  ocean of night carrying lanterns at their prows in the shape  of eyes which black or brown by day become glowing sparks  in the gloom These perhaps are the only Insect eyes which  may be strictly called luminous but those of the fierce Dragon  Fly and of its gentle prey the white Garden Butterfly display  in daylight a more than ordinary share of crystalline trans  parency  Of eyelids Insects we believe are wholly destitute but they  are often amply provided with eyelashes or with what stands  them in the stead of those protective appendages Their pur  pose in defending the concave surface of the eye from dust and  various injuries is supplied by an assemblage of hairs with  which the cornea of Bees and many other Insects is overspread  the hairs which spring from its reticulate divisions having been  likened when viewed microscopically to a forest of firtrees  Linnseus and other naturalists have doubted whether Insects  hear although from common observation as well as from  general evidence their hearing would seem as little a matter of  question as their sight Their oral organs would appear less de  cidedly ascertained It is however usual to suppose that these  are none other than the antennse those slender flexible  appendages capable of being directed like the long movable  ears of an ass or a hare to all quarters for the conveyance of  sound Their projection and position in front of the head  favours by analogy the idea of their being adapted to the same  use as the ears of other animals and the infinite variety of form  by which those of the latter are distinguished has been fairly  urged against objections on the score of their unusual shape  Observations such as may be multiplied daily by ourselves  have also tended to confirm the above inference founded on  analogy Kirby adduces among other examples the common  use made by those prying parasites the Ichneumon Plies of  their long flexible evermoving antennse which they are  accustomed to plunge into the deep nestholes of the solitary  Bees whose grubs are converted into living receptacles for  their eggs Some indeed have conjectured that it may be  merely with intent to explore the nest and feel for her infant  victim that the insidious Ichneumon thus inserts her antennse  but since the holes are always so deep as to prevent the possibility  of her thus reaching the grubs as they live at the bottom it  seems much more probable according to the opinion of  the writer in question that she rather employs them as ears to  detect any sound of eating or moving from the occupant of the  nest  Yarious other Insects have been observed to direct their  antennse towards the quarter whence noise proceeds Among  these the longhorned or longeared tribe of Grasshoppers and  Crickets are as Rennie remarks especially alive to the sounds  which usually give notice of the approach of friend or foe  such as the rustle of a leaf or the footfall of an Insect brother  The same naturalist observed a green Grasshopper incline an  attentive ear to the rustle of a piece of paper under the table  where it was placed bending its long antennse or one of them  in the direction of the sound  It would seem then scarcely to be doubted that Insects hear  with their antennse and that with the same instrument they  also touch and feel appears almost as evident Tor it is in the  exercise of touch and feeling applied to purposes of social inter  course that these flexible appendages are constantly employed  by Ants and Bees which are said on this account to converse  by antennal language Nor does this supposed use of them at  all militate against that of the same organs for conveyance of  sound These however are all matters of inquiry on which a  degree of doubt is still existing quite sufficient to invite the  lovers of nature to make active and careful use of their own  senses judgmentguided in the investigation of those resem  bling gifts bestowed upon the Insect tribe The nature of  Insect voices with the instruments by which they are made  audible will form the subject of another Episode Suffice it  to notice here that a power of producing sounds would scarcely  have been given them unless a capability of mutual commu  nication through their medium had at the same time been  afforded By these and perhaps also by smaller voices to us  inaudible the passions of Insects are likewise no doubt ex  pressed and that their tones though entirely instrumental  are susceptible of alteration at least through fear is evidenced  by a common fact noticed alike by naturalists and poets  When a fly finds herself in the power of her Spiderfoe her   Muttering wing   And shriller sound declare extreme distress  a sound totally distinct from her usual buzz and elicited only  by that excess of terror or peculiar form of it which even  capture by the hand or in a honeypot is insufficient to call  forth The shrill scold of a Humble Bee when imprisoned in  the hand gives audible evidence no less indisputable of mingled  fear and anger  Insects are preeminently gifted with the sense of smell No  flock of vultures can be directed more unerringly to their re  volting prey by scenting its odours from afar than are certain  Insects such as Dungflies and Carrion Beetles whose corres  ponding office is to assist in ridding the earth of offensive  objects That the sense of smell alone directs the Blowfly in  the deposition of her eggs has been fully proved by the fact of  her having through misguided instinct been found to lay them  on silk wherewith tainted meat has been covered or upon the  illodoured Stapelias a tribe of hothouse plants which in scent  greatly resemble it  The Butterfly and Bee with other winged collectors whose  more agreeable business lies among sweet odours are equally  quick scented in their detection at distances almost incredible  Erom a prodigious height not less it has been estimated  than sixteen or twenty feet the former lights down upon its  favourite flower while the latter wings its way for miles in the  exact direction of flowery fields and thymy downs from which  scented breezes bring them invitation Even when at hand  it is the odour of flowers rather than their appearance by which  both Bees and Butterflies would seem to be enticed for it was  found by M Huber that four Bees and a Butterfly were  speedily assembled round some honey which he had placed for  experiment in a window concealed by shutters only sufficiently  open to admit their passage Availing themselves of this  liking for sweets and perception of their distant and invisible  presence moth collectors are in the habit of anointing the  trunks of trees with honey or thick syrup by which means  they attract and capture not a few varieties  The perception of Insects with regard to odours is farther  evidenced bj the peculiar scents which several of them are  known to emit and the purposes to which their emission is in  some instances applied In the case for example of the Ant  so well known to be redolent of Formic acid the perfume left as  it travels on its line of march has been ascertained to serve  as a guiding clue to its comrades in the rear  Though thus generally admitted to be what the Italians  would call most excellent Nasuti Insects still puzzle us as to  what exact part of their enigmatical frames may be con  sidered an olfactory organ This is a point on which natu  ralists of the highest credit have been so much at issue that  when we read the opinions of each and the experimental  evidence adduced by each in support of his own we seem as if  we could scarcely arrive between them at any nearer conclusion  than that Insects must be all nose  By Kirby and Spence they are invested indeed with the nasal  appendage corresponding in position if not always in shape  with the conspicuous proboscis of a man a monkey and the  other Mammalia Huber also opined that their organ of smell  is seated in the head and near the mouth at all events in the  case of the Bee and in proof of his position he tells us that  having dipped a fine pencil in oil of turpentine he approached  it carefully to every part of a Bees head but without causing  the least apparent sensation until approximated to that in  question when the Insect starting suddenly from the honey  on which it was regaling beat its wings with violence and  would have flown off but for a removal of the offence On  repetition of the experiment the same effect ensued the angry  Bee fanning itself with its wings as if to blow away the un  welcome odour  Bor all this neither arguments nor facts are wanting to  make it seem probable that insects in general are desti  tute of noses or at least of the noses proper usually recog  nised as such The following is a plausible reason on this side  of the question Smelling and breathing as every one knows  by his own inspiration are faculties very intimately connected  it would hardly seem indeed that the former could be carried  on without the latter Now insects it is well known do not  breathe through the head at all but usually through a row of  pipes running along each side of the trunk termed spiracles  or breathing tubes of which the mouths are clearly dis  coverable in grubs and caterpillars To these spiracles then  as organs of breathing has been assigned also the office of  smell and though this doctrine and the above may appear at  first sight totally at variance perhaps the truth when clearly  ascertained may nearly reconcile their difference inasmuch as  the last or upper pair of spiracles though not seated in the  head approach it very closely The spiracles in a Bees neck  are said to be placed at the origin of the tongue  No one can observe and consider the works of Insects  without feeling pretty well assured that their sense of touch  be it seated where it may is exceedingly acute and delicate  and that though they build and weave without the help  of hands they must be provided with some handy instruments  or organs which to them sufficiently supply the place of that  most admirable piece of Divine mechanism  The feet of our insect artificers curiously jointed and often  palmed seem to partake indeed of the power and to perform  in some measure the office of our hands but in aid of the  feet the antennae and the palpi fourjointed bodies near the  mouth popularly termed feelers are also for ever at work to  try touch and examine  The wings are also ranked by Eennie as organs of touch  and as of no mean importance in the guidance of flight their  surface being furnished with nerves adapted to that purpose  He considers it therefore probable that Bees may be enabled  to return so unerringly to their hives in part at least through  the varied impressions of air upon their wings  The susceptibility evinced by Insects to atmospheric changes  and their prescience in consequence with regard to weather  is evident to all who are accustomed to observe them  When says Kirby a tempest is approaching they are  most abundant and many species may then be taken which  are not at other times to be met with but before the storm  comes on all disappear This high sensitivity to electric  changes has been attributed to the antennae and to the hairs  with which the bodies of many insects are thickly covered  We come now in the last case to the important faculty  of taste with which Insects of all classes and in every  region of the earth whether of propensities herbivorous  or carnivorous are found to be no less exquisitely gifted  Caterpillars are according to their kind either general or par  ticular feeders but even the former confine themselves to  particular classes of plants and among the latter are some so  exceedingly nice that cormorants as they are they would  sooner die of hunger than eat of leaves other than those which  furnish their accustomed food The caterpillars of those  beautiful little meadow Butterflies the Blues and the   Coppers which feed in their infancy on the grasses over  which they subsequently sport are wont we are told to  appropriate each for its own peculiar fare one of the various  species which are often intermingled in its native meadow  that most likely on which with instinctive foresight and dis  cernment the parent had deposited her egg Other cater  pillars found sometimes on the poplar sometimes on the  willow have been found to eat only the leaves of its tree of  birth and displaying a degree of discrimination yet greater we  have observed in those of the Lime Hawkmoth a decided pre  ference for leaves from the very tree whence they were taken  There are not wanting however amongst the liveried company  of leafeaters examples of appetite infinitely more accomodating  and among these the tufted plumed and gaudycoloured   Rennie Insect Miscellanies  caterpillars of the Yapourer we have found regaling indis  criminately upon willow pear oak and hawthorn  The accuracy of taste conferred upon the Bee has sometimes  been called in question on the ground that this indefatigable  gatherer is by no means particular as to the source from whence  she collects her honied stores giving in that process more  heed as it would seem to quantity than quality of material Yet  herein we may be sure Mistress Bee knows what she is about  just as well as her insect fellows She is most likely quite as  discriminate as they in culling for her own appetite and that  of her infant charges and both it is probable would come but  poorly off were her collections confined to those particular  flowers or districts which in our opinion supply honey of the  finest flavour though not of necessity that most grateful to  the palate of a Bee Our poet in writing of this Insect   Whose sense so subtly true  From poisnous herbs extracts the healing dew  may seem indeed at variance with certain matter of fact  relaters ancient and modern among them Xenophon and  Tournefort who tell us of poisonous honey collected from the  blossoms of the rhododendron roselaurel and yellow azalia  in Asia minor and also in Philadelphia from the flowers of  Kalmia latifolia  The honeys drawn from the above and other deleterious  plants are related to have produced most serious disorders  even to fatality both in man and beast but supposing such  evil consequences to fall on those only who feed on honey by  usurpation while the insect concoctors and rightful consumers  feed unharmed the latter we think are hardly open to the  imputation of an erring taste in the selection of ingredients  wherein though there may be death to others there is health  to them A few instances are however on record where the  Bees are said to have thus fatally drugged their sweet possets  even for themselves  Again both Bees and Butterflies are well known to be any  thing but what we call nice in the choice of water the dirty  puddle or even dunghill pool being to all appearances as  acceptable to their palates as the sparkling rivulet or pearly  dewdrop but then it is said that Bees only drink from these  fountains of impurity in early spring and as it is supposed  for the sake of the salts which they contain and which they  imbibe it is further concluded for a like purpose to that  wherewith we lovers in general of sweets are accustomed to  take springdoses of saline and other unpalatable flavours  The animalfeeders of the Insect race are no less choice than  the livers upon vegetable diet with respect to the selection of  their viands Foremost among these if ranked according  to the quality of food are the notorious Biters and Suckers  which regale on man and who cannot testify on experience  whether as sufferers or exempt that their discrimination is ex  ceedingly nice as to the flavour of vital fluids Some indeed  of the parasitic tribe which live by the juices of their fellow  insects such as Mites c are said sometimes to make prey  indifferently of Beetles Butterflies Ants and Meldcrickets  but this love of variety no more proves their want of taste or  power of discrimination than the gourmands liking for and  nice appreciation of the varied viands of his table  With regard to the particular organ whereby the taste of  Insects is chiefly exercised both analogy and observation point  to the mouth and tongue In Dragonflies Grasshoppers  and Crickets this little member is rounded and somewhat  resembling that of quadrupeds in others its shape is curiously  varied in the Wasp forked like a serpents in Sawflies  triply divided in Bees long and tubular in Bugs awlshaped  and sharp but in all as has been proved by recent discovery  the organs of taste and digestion are moistened and kept in  order by a due supply of saliva from pipes opening sometimes  into the mouth sometimes into the gullet and sometimes into  the stomach as may be most suitable for the purposes of  digestion and according to the greater or less solidity of food  Of the existence and one of the uses of this salivary supply  we are furnished with a common example in the proceedings of  a My in discussion in solution rather of a lump of sugar  by help of a solvent let down through the sucker which serves  afterwards to draw up the syrup We have seen the same  operation performed by the Gamma y and other Moths  We must here have done for the present with Insect senses  Our brief description of them has been to the eye but a sketch  copied chiefly from the laboured pictures of careful naturalists   to the ear it would read but as an imperfect echo of their  minute descriptions attractive indeed when verified by obser  vation but in the mere perusal smelling somewhat more of  the lamp of science than of the flowery sunny fields We have  but touched on what has been elaborately handled given a  taste only of what has furnished ample food for inquiry to  many minds greedy of knowledge which with all they have  devoured leave an exhaustless store behind but little as we  have laid before our readers on the subject of Insect senses  that little may have sufficed we hope as an incentive to the  at least occasional employment of their own upon the nature  and manifestations of those similar gifts bestowed upon the  tiniest Midge and wherein the Midge may be looked on as  equal to the man except inasmuch as the senses of the latter  are exercised as handmaids to observation and to thought  But are our senses and our reason worthily occupied in  scrutiny of the miniature organism of the tiny beings whose  endowments we have been considering P We think they are  There are miracles of minuteness as well as of magnitude and  in few things perhaps is the power of the Creator more admi  rably displayed than in the perfect senses of Insects considered  relatively to their size We can imagine a spark of life  enclosed in the body of a Mite because we are accustomed to  consider vitality as a thing independent of space therein  resembling its divine source but when we think of five seven  or more distinct senses each with its perfect curious often  complicated mechanic organ as existing in a creature no bigger  than a full stop or even invisible to our unassisted sight we  are led at once from the extreme of minuteness to the infinite  vastness of that Creative Power whose works can neither be  circumscribed by want of space nor lose one atom of impor  tance because for want of bulk they may be impalpable to our  limited perception  On the whole then it would appear that Insects can boast  of very rich endowments in the gifts of sense and ample in pro  portion would seem the amount of enjoyment which they are  permitted to derive from their exercise Our little denizens of  leaf and flower are in short most epicurean animals  Already is their feast begun on the succulent and tender pro  ducts of the spring but let us for a moment anticipate a  season more advanced let us wander together on some fine  morning of midsummer into the fragrant flowery woods and  while our other senses drink delight involuntary let us fix our  sight and regale it upon a visible epitome a perfect concentra  tion of Insect pleasure tasted through the medium of like senses  with our own Ask you where Why on this branchlet of the  graceful eglantine Look in the very centre of that ex  panded rose rolling and revelling amidst the crowded anthers  and scattering their golden dust upon the ivory petals is a red  tailed or redtipped Humblebee He we may be sure is in  the very height of enjoyment as ever and anon he sings shrilly  with delight and plunges deeper and deeper into the perfumed  chalice Can anything exceed his energetic active pleasure  Only possibly the calm lazy luxuriance of that sleek soft  Sybaritish Caterpillar rosefed rosecradled now regaling  heedless of the joy above him on a delicate morsel of the  flowery couch whereon he lies his green length extended the  very image of sensual sloth  But ah Sir Caterpillar thou pillager of cates fit for the  food of fairy blissful as thou seemest in discussion of thy  roseate repast here is a brother a less bulky one of thy gor  mandizing race who as we verily believe is eating his break  fast albeit a coarser one than thine a green rose leaf not a  pearly petal with a keener relish than thyself and why  Because by labour he has earned it and earned too a greater  measure of security from attack of surrounding foes quick  sighted bird and yet more dangerous quickeared prying  piercing Ichneumon He hangs close by encased all but the  head and shoulders which on the slightest alarm he would  presently encase too in a tent or hammock of his own work  manship curiously wrought of leaves of the rosetree spirally  rolled together and suspended by silken cords of his own  spinning so as to bring him within convenient reach of the  young green foliage on which he is making his repast  Let us notice last though it seems not least the evi  dent ecstasy of a thirsty habitually thirsty Butterfly a little  Gardenwhite come to the wood thus early to drink the  falling dewdrops ere they dry while overhead seated on the  branch above her are a pair of pretty japan Moths laying  their heads together for discussion doubtless in antennal  language of some topic of mutual interest the alarming  sound perhaps of our voices or our footsteps for now turn  ing their long horns otherwise long ears towards us they  take to flight ere we have time to catch more than a glimpse  of their beautiful fringed wings of bronze and gold Ah  little fairies it had been better for our cabinet and worse for  you if your sentinel senses had been less on the alert  The above is no imaginary picture but a group of objects  which may be seen any summers day in localities such as  we have represented  I love an honest thief  The month of Mars has been unusually pacific and Our  Ladys Day has brought us in consequence a thicker  sprinkling than usual of early spring flowers not yet indeed  profusely but most impartially has Flora begun to scatter her  gifts in earnest of future bounties The speed well by the  wayside already smiles encouragement to the traveller the  daisy eye of day looks up cheerily from the meadow the  woodanemone peeps out gaily from the copse the bare  blossom of the coltsfoot like a released captive eager for light  and liberty has shot from underground to meet the sun  without waiting to put on her greenleaf mantle Every  garden has its scattering of snowdrops crocuses and hepatica  and now there is not a wall so mouldering not a bank so dry  not a spot so barren but can boast its peculiar ornament in  the lively white blossoms of the whitlegrass  Tufting also the roof of many an humble cottage this little  hardy flower of poverty and promise seems created as if at  once to impart and to betoken hopeful feelings such feelings  as are in the present season the natural spring growth of every  healthy mind in every station however permitted for awhile  and for ends of Infinite Wisdom to be crushed or stinted  most frequently alas among the poor through human agency  But how amidst spring flowers have we stumbled on oppres  sion that foul weed of the social garden Perhaps because like  the whitloegrass it clings not unfrequently to cottage roofs  and perhaps also because with the return of even a spring  quarter distresses are too closely intertwined in the shape  of notices distrainings or ejectments consummations dire to  a dark winter of struggle starvation sickness and old age  one perhaps or all of them  But no more of these moral bindweeds choking the spring  products of the mind except to read in the page of Natures  book now open an emblematic prophecy of their extermina  tion In the glow of that genial and rising spirit of ameliora  tion which now prevails slowly but surely they will disappear  even as the icy fetters which arrested but a month ago the  gliding surface of this streamlet See how gaily does it now  sparkle in the sun putting on to be in fashion a wreath  of gladness and reflecting in lieu of leafless branches the  glories of the palm willow already rich in the gold and silver  of her flowery catkins This willows wealth would seem how  ever like other riches to have had its attractions for the  spoiler for here is a host of Insect plunderers finally awakened  from their winter torpor and brought from far by the honied  perfume which fills the air Yet truly these are no plunderers  they are the labourers of the hive We ask your pardon little  types and patterns of industry and are right glad to see you  on the wing Load your thighpanniers as you please with  golden treasure you are no pilferers for you take without  despoiling and you rob for us  But stay what have we here an idler among labourers a  highwayman among travellers a Wasp among Bees A  Wasp in March Yes truly and a Wasp of Wasps a very  Robin Hood of plunderers in comparison with whom the last  of his pilfering fraternity seen in autumn on the last peach  was but a Little John indeed Let us watch his proceedings  Is he going a la coutume to attack the Bees or contrary  to custom the flowers only Neither for scornfully passing  over both he has alighted on this old post beside the willow  and there he stays by turns walking and standing and  shaking his wings Now he seems to be engaged about  something but what nobody can tell unless he is biting and  gnawing the wood for very idleness or perhaps waspish  fellow as he is for very illhumour at seeing the Bees so  happy and so busy around him  There he has left the post and flown down to the bankside  and now all at once he has disappeared within a hole the  hybernacnlum we fancy of some fieldmouse into which he has  entered without even the common civility of asking permission  What business is he after some mischief or another thats  certain for whenever yet was Wasp or vagrant intent on good  always poking his nose now into this cranny now into that  peering here and prying there Well theres not an atom of  his great goldenwinged body to be discerned within the  tunnel so theres certainly no seeing what he is about and he  will not tell us if we wait for his return besides a cloud has  passed over the sun the Bees have all gone off some with  panniers only halfloaded as if expecting an April shower  before its time and perhaps we shall be prudent to take their  warning and go home too  Here we are again seated by our own fire such as is  always agreeable on an overcast afternoon in early spring  and we are consequently in pleasant mood disposed to be  in goodhumour with and do justice to all with propor  tionate desire to atone for word or deed of unfairness com  mitted towards the meanest creature Now some such  debt of compensation do we owe to that gigantic Wasp met  with in our morning walk and left just now exploring the  mousehole tunnel We have been employing it is true the  last halfhour in recording with the utmost accuracy those of  its proceedings which met the eye but then we have hinted at  its purposes only in accordance with the common and preju  diced notion that Wasps are always after mischief while we  were all the while perfectly aware that our Wasp was bent  upon an enterprise which however fraught to us with inci  pient evil was in itself highly laudable and worthy not of an  idler or a freebooter but of a perfect hero or more properly  heroine this great individual being in fact of the female sex  Now suppose a certain princess perhaps but recently a bride  to have seen her husband and her servants fall successively  around her the victims of some sweeping pestilence followed  by an earthquake Erom a violent paroxysm she herself sinks  into a stupor of grief from which she awakes to find herself  alone Under such trying circumstances she feels perhaps  that she would rather sit and wring her handkerchief till she  had wept like Niobe a pool big enough to drown at once  her sorrows and herself but having a right royal spirit she  combats her womans weakness by thoughts magnanimous  Though it would be easier to die she must live and bestir  herself not for her own sake but to uphold the honour of her  princely house which can only indeed be preserved from  utter extinction by the preservation of the posthumous heir  which she is likely to bring soon into his desolate inheritance  In earnest therefore does she arouse her energies and so  much to the purpose are they employed that she succeeds at  length by dint of individual exertion in founding a new city  and a new empire which peopled by her descendants  becomes fully equal to those of whose ruins she was the sur  vivor Of a widowed princess playing such a part it would  be said that she was a pattern heroine and we must now  advance the claims of a widowed Wasp to a title somewhat  similar for the performance of a like extraordinary achieve  ment  It is commonly known we believe that the race of Wasps  in general   Falls as the leaves do and dies in October  Such in fact is the case with the numerous herd of working  or as we generally call them thieving Wasps with the males  a quiet stayathome class with which we have little personal  acquaintance and with a portion of the females but of the  latter which are several times the size of the others a few  winter survivors are always left in every nest These of  which our bulky visitant to the mousehole was one after a  season of torpidity awake in early spring when each taking  her own separate beat chooses a favourable site for a new nest  Of this she is the architect and at this she works wholly un  assisted until the eggs which she takes care to deposit in its  first cells furnish her with assistants in the building and  peopling of her colony Although we do not dignify this  motherfoundress of the Wasps nest with the name of queen  she earns certainly by her independent exertions a much  higher claim to that title than does the pampered monarch of  the Beehive who keeps her state in idleness or performs  nothing for the honour she receives except increasing the  numbers of her subjects Be it noted however that the  foundress Wasp although the first is not the sole mother of  her community  We have now we hope done away with any erroneous  impressions which we in our introduction of a foundress  Wasp might to her prejudice have helped to confirm but  we shall go farther and at the risk of incurring almost as much  odium as themselves attempt a defence of Wasps in general  At its head however we must be allowed to place a well  remembered incident of our childhood because it may help to  account for our strange advocacy of a persecuted race  When we were of stature exceeding by about a head the  height of our nurses knee we learnt to lisp after her the  wellknown hymn of Dr Watts holding up Bee excellence  for baby imitation One sunny afternoon as she was enforcing  its moral by the busy appliance of her needle and repeating  we after her line upon line of our daily lesson   How doth the little busy Bee  Improve each shining hour  our eyes were attracted by the sight of a Wasp which had  settled on the apron of onr instructress Pointing our little  forefinger towards the intruder in whom we innocently  thought that we had our subject bodily before us we were  surprised to see our nurse start up with a scream let fall  her work shake her apron and stamp on the floor until a  few scattered fragments were all that remained of the hap  less insect Kill the busy Bee we exclaimed but were  sharply answered that it was a spiteful venomous Wasp  and that we were very silly not to know the difference In  what that difference consisted was a point however on which  our nurse did not deem it requisite to enlighten us But  our childish curiosity was awakened and in order to its satisfac  tion the very next time we saw an Insect which we were pretty  certain was either Bee or Wasp halfburied in a flowercup  we laid hands on it with a view to examination The little  forager as might have been expected stung our fingers but  now making sure that it was a Wasp we repressed a rising  scream and having first returned pinch for sting threw off  our enemy and trampled it under foot Triumphantly carry  ing the remains of our vanquished foe to our good nurse we  met with condemnation instead of praise for meddling with  the Bees the most innocent creatures in the world if nobody  offended them Prom that memorable day we took care  never to handle either Wasp or Bee though we had learnt to  distinguish one from the other And this early impression  may account for an unusual preference except in the matter  of honey for the genus Vespa over the genus Apis but there  are grounds for it which remain to be set forth  We have seen already the vast superiority of the mother  foundress of a Wasp community over that lump of pampered  productiveness called the Queen Bee and the difference in  favour of Wasps is yet more marked in the development of  masculine character The very name of the male or Drone Bee  has passed into a proverb expressive of idleness luxury and in  significance living on others labour qualities in the Insect so  burthensome even to his own kind that he is tolerated only  as a necessary evil and got rid of as soon as possible whereas  the male Wasp although it comes not into his province either  to build at home or to forage abroad is a goodnatured active  fellow disposed to do all he can and to make himself generally  useful He is described by Huber as sweeping the terraces  and passages of the nest removing thence all things that  offend and even as undertaking to dispose decently of the  dead a task wherein he calls in the aid of companions when  his own strength proves inadequate to its performance Ac  cording to his merit and his usefulness he is estimated by his fel  lowcitizens for he lives with them as long as the season and his  constitution will permit and the cruel autumn massacre which  defiles the Beehive is in the Waspnest a thing unknown  From the female and the male come we now last not least  to what has been called the Wasp neuter that correspondent  with the worker Bee and worker Ant wherein the best  qualities of both sexes the tenderness and patience of the one  and the bravery and activity of the other seem to meet on  neutral ground be it noted however that this neutral ground  so rich in every quality but that of productiveness is in fact  female  Of this latter class are nearly all the Wasps with which we  are commonly acquainted both those which as stragglers or  scouts appear through the earlier months of summer and those  which forming the main body make their descent in August or  more properly their ascent from underground barracks to sap  our fruits and invade our parlours and larders Under this their  characters of notorious depredators we seem to have arrived  at a difficult point in the defence we have undertaken but  even here we are not at fault for some most excellent  pleas in behalf of our maligned clients That Wasps are  thieves there is no denying but they are generous thieves  They steal from us and from our pampered Honeybees not  merely to gratify a thievish or a greedy propensity but with  a view to supply the wants of the helpless and poor of their  community Not a grain of sugar nor a drop of honey or of  peachjuice do they swallow of which a portion is not dis  gorged birdlike into the hungry mouths of their infant  population while not a morsel of meat is pilfered or a fly  carried off of which the whole or part is not made over to  the younger and stayathome members of the horde  Bees as well as Wasps are sometimes robbers and of a much  worse description because they rob their brethren It is not  unfrequent we are told for the inhabitants of a distressed hive  to turn marauders under the name of Corsairbees These  not only attack in a body more prosperous communities but  like highway robbers will lie in wait by parties of three and  four for any unfortunate single Bee returning alone and laden  to its hive One seizes it by a leg another by a wing or  perhaps there are two on each side confining or pulling its  limbs while they maul and pummel its chest and bite its  head This maltreatment obliges it to disgorge its honey  which the robbers eagerly lap till they are satisfied and then  let their prisoner go  The Wasps are above such mean and cowardly proceed  ings we never heard at least of their turning under any  extremity robbers of their kind and therefore socially con  sidered they are no robbers at all Then for courage a wasp  is scarcely to be equalled A single one will venture it is  said to face a whole hive of Bees after a booty of honey and  is in fair combat a match for any three inhabitants of the  apiary The same character of boldness accompanies and in  our opinion helps to redeem the depredations of the Wasp as  exercised upon ourselves Bull of spirit as she is she is as  difficult to get rid of as an unwelcome guest who has no spirit  at all We may crush her nay cut her and still cut in  vain She will even partake our meal and complete her  own after that most unkindly cut of all which severs  her head from her body Of one it is recorded that she  lived three days after decapitation a miracle of nature only  to be matched by the legendary ones of St Dionysius St  Winifred or their Saxon prototype Queen Oswitha who when  her head was cut off by the Danes carried it three furlongs  before she fell down and died  But suppose them killed what is our gain in having dealt  death singly or by retail to our pilfering customers Nothing  usually but a flushed face a soiled handkerchief and may be  a swollen finger By treacherously drowning them in sweet  delights of beer and sugar we do but little better since for  the scores thus perishing we attract many more by our vessels  of temptation and phials of wrath The only mode then of  Wasp massacre which we consider other than wanton because  not futile is their wholesale destruction when we can come at  them in their own strongholds within the earth We might  possibly however be of a different opinion were we in the  grocery line and subject to any such tremendous loss as that  of Â£20 said to have been experienced by a single tradesman  in one season in the article of sugar  Both Reaumur and the younger Huber studied the domestic  economy of the common Wasp as they did that of Bees by  means of glass hives In this they were greatly assisted by the  extreme affection of Wasps for their young for though the  nest be carried off cut in various directions and exposed to  the light they never abandon it or relax in their attention to  their progeny No less admirable than the affection thus  testified is their ingenuity displayed under the same circum  stances of distress in repairing the breaches of their habitation  removing its ruins and fixing it to the glass by columns of  support Operations such as these suggested by and adapted  to unlooked for exigences savour certainly of something  beyond the limited powers of instinct an dan anecdote related  of the Wasp by Dr Darwin exemplifies yet more strongly  its capacity of adapting means to ends The doctor saw on  his gravel walk a Wasp with a My nearly as big as itself  Kneeling down he distinctly observed it cut off the head  and abdomen of its prey and then taking up the trunk to  which the wings remained attached fly away but a breeze of  wind acting upon the wings of the My turned round the Wasp  with its burthen and impeded its progress Upon this it  again alighted sawed off first one wing and then the other  and having thus removed the cause of its embarrassment flew  off with its booty In the above instance the Wasp seemed to  have omitted a part of its usual operation on the bodies of  captured Mies all the wings of which we have several times  seen them thus dexterously cut off  Let us now return to our starting point of this morning  the streamlet side the palm willow the hole in the bank  and the giantess of her kind who disappeared within it At  her business there we may now make a tolerable guess namely  that as survivor of an old house and sole foundress of a new  one she was employed in laying its foundations having availed  herself as is not uncommonly the case of the previous labours  of a mouse to save her own in the preparatory business  of excavation Quite as frequently however the foundress  Wasp is indebted to no other agency than that of her own  powerful jaws and claws for the digging out and carrying away  of the earth in which she forms her burrow a chamber  usually of one or two feet in diameter approachable from with  out by a narrow entrance gallery This subterranean area  being found or formed her next operation is to lay within it  the foundations or walls of her intended city For this purpose  earth is a material which will not serve her turn and the  nature of that which she employs was long a puzzle The  substance of which the walls and cells of a vespiary are con  structed is now however ascertained to be none other than  paper formed of woodraspings mixed with a sort of size  worked to a paste and subsequently spread into sheets by the  Insect fabricator  We have continually noticed and any one in summertime  may do the same a Wasp busily at work with its jaws upon  an old paling or window frame Now many may suppose that  there is little in this worthy of observation but simply from  notice of this trifling and common circumstance did Reaumur  discover the Wasp to be a paper maker and was enabled to  trace the subsequent processes of her manufacture Had these  been observed sooner our art of papermaking as now prac  tised might have had an earlier date The foundress whom  we saw this morning had been occupied while settled on the  post in the first or woodrasping process of her fabrication  and on entering the hole she no doubt carried with her a bun  dle of fibres to be kneaded into paperpaste Then supposing  that the nest was in an early stage of progress she would  proceed to spread a covering of this substance over the roof or  upper part of her excavated chamber strengthening the same  with repeated layers Her next proceedings have been thus  described â–  Having finished the ceiling she begins to  build the first terrace of her city which under its protection  she suspends horizontally and not like the combs of a Bee  hive in a perpendicular position The suspension of which  we speak is light and elegant compared with the more heavy  union of the Hivebee s combs It is in fact a hanging floor  or terrace immovably secured by rods of similar material with  the roof but rather stronger The terrace itself is circular  and composed of an immense number of cells made of the paper  already described and almost of the same size and form as  those of a honeycomb each being a perfect hexagon These  cells however are never used as honeypots by Wasps as   Insect Architecture p 76  they are by Bees for Wasps make no honey and the cells  are wholly appropriated to rearing the young When the  foundress Wasp has completed a certain number of cells and  deposited eggs in them she soon intermits her building ope  rations in order to procure food for the young grubs which  now require all her care In a few weeks these become perfect  Wasps and lend their assistance in the extension of the edifice  enlarging the original coping of the foundress by side walls  and forming another platform of cells suspended to the first  by columns as that had been suspended to the ceiling Thus  gradually by the end of summer this city of hanging terraces  is completed the descendants of the original foundress many  of whom are females assisting also to provide its population  which according to the calculation of Reaumur may amount  in one year to 30000  Kirby has designated the Beehive a waxen palace the  Wasp nest a paper cottage but with all due deference to  that distinguished naturalist we can scarcely admit the wide  difference implied in such terms of comparison But let us  liken it to whatsoever we may palace cottage or city the  desolation which falls sooner or later on every palace of pride  every cottage of peace every city of business rushes at a pace  of more than ordinary swiftness on the habitation of the Wasp  Scarcely has it arrived at completion through the labours of  the youngest generation of its inhabitants when the early  frosts of autumn slightly thin their numbers their active  limbs and wings begin to stiften their vital juices to grow  sluggish their bold spirits to grow tame their supplies and  their energies to seek them fail both together The same indivi  dual who under the summer sun would have fearlessly opposed  a whole host of Bees now suffers a starveling Ply to enter her  habitation and insult her weakness When November comes  the W asp population is cut of as by a pestilence of those  abroad some fall far from their habitation others crawl back to  die while those at home lately so busy in the works of build  ing repairing or keeping in order are now sluggishly inactive  Even their ruling passion their powerful affection for their  young becomes extinguished with the torpor of other feelings  or through an instinctive foresight that all are about to perish   for the cradled occupants of the cells are neglected and  allowed to die of want without an effort to supply their crav  ings It is even said that in the extremity of their misery  and despair the old Wasps destroy and drag them from their  cells In a little while the city of terraces becomes a city of  the dead its sole surviving dwellers and they happily buried  in torpor are some two or three of the widowed females such  as the one seen at work this morning on whom depends the  perpetuation of the race No sooner does the early spring  awake them than like her they depart each on her way to  found another city  We are almost inclined to wonder why one at least of these  survivors good housewives as they are does not bustle about  repair damages cast out remains sweep out chambers and  furbish up the already complete abode instead of setting out  at the cost of infinite pains and trouble to commence a new  one Perhaps however such appropriation by one or two  of the readymade property to which all might claim an  equal right might cause disputes very unbecoming to an  Insect family of which the members are not accustomed  to quarrel amongst themselves Perhaps also their paper  walls are too much weakened by the influence of winter  frosts and thaws to weather another summer or perhaps  But without further question the female Wasp  undoubtedly is best informed upon her own business and to  her discretion we may safely leave it  Our defence is concluded Can a Wasphater remain  among its readers  THE ROYAL KEEORM   Subjects commonly do find  New made Sovereigns most kind  There was great grief in one of the monarchies of the earth  the queen regnant of a numerous people had just been summoned  to her ancestors Yesterday she was a brilliant spark of life  from which light and activity extended to the very circum  ference of her kingdom today she is but a dull lump of  mortality casting its shade and imparting its torpor far and  wide around The cheerful hum of labour is hushed in every  quarter and in its stead arises the mournful wail of lamentation  The royal corpse is cold yet faithful attendants and devoted  bodyguards still watch around it as if reluctant to believe  their occupation gone Some of these loving creatures will  even starve upon their grief and fall dead themselves around  the body of their defunct mistress  But the kingdom of Apia that of which we now write was  always a monarchy of marvels and of strange customs and  those which regarded the succession to the crown were some  of the strangest among them The chief population of the  country consisted of females who were all spinsters and who  filled every active office in the state from the very lowest to  the highest save one that of the sovereign who was also  always a female but never continued a virgin queen It  would however occasionally happen that proper heiresses or  princesses of the bloodroyal were wanting to fill a vacant  throne in which case a curious expedient was wont to be re  sorted to Several infants were selected from among the  labouring population and from the close apartments and con  fined cradles belonging to their station were transferred to stately  nurseries and luxurious cots and in lieu of common nourish  ment supplied abundantly with food expressly manufactured  for making queens The quality of this precious article was  so nutritive and of such marvellous virtue as not only to swell  these chosen vessels of royalty to a prodigious size but also to  fill them with endowments bodily and mental quite different  to what they would have possessed in their original condition  and exactly suited to that station which one or more of them  was destined to fill Who would have thought that a people  possessed of such an elixir for making perfect sovereigns  could ever have been tempted to disregard or pervert a gift so  unheard of or that not contented with the modelling power  thus put into their hands they should ever have desired to  exercise it to a greater extent and after a different fashion  Yet so in the course of ages it was destined to happen and  the rise of this extraordinary spirit of innovation among the  people of Apia occurred at the epoch when our relation com  mences namely that of the royal demise  Amidst the general demonstrations of respect and grief for  her late Apian majesty only one class of her subjects wore an  appearance of indifference and that was the very class wherein  a stranger to courts might have least expected to find it  namely amongst the deceased queens favourites or candidates  for her favour for having been cut off in the springtime of  her age it was not yet known that she had selected a prince  consort from amongst her suitors who rivalling in number  those of Penelope amounted to no less than 400 Already  indeed had she been suspected by the jealous eyes of 339 to  look with favour upon one and in any other state it might  possibly have happened that in the failure of natural heirs  this favourite might have made a venture for the crown But  as already said the succession in Apia was in the female line  nor was this a wonder for the entire masculine population was  always comprised in the suitors of royalty aforesaid than whom  APIAN COURTIERS  235  even among ordinary court danglers a more effeminate set never  existed Doing nothing caring for nothing but to eat sleep  and philander with their royal mistress they were the only  members of the Apian community who never wore swords and  whether as queens suitors or queens consorts they were  equally regarded except just in that limited capacity as the  merest nonentities From one generation to another these  poltroons had submitted without care or murmur to their  humiliating position and unwarned by the usual fate of their  predecessors were accustomed to purchase a brief season of  idleness and luxury by a bloody end The Amazonian queens  of Apia were in fact a species of female Bluebeard not that  they exactly murdered or even ordered the execution of their  numerous lovers or husbands but being truly patriotic  sovereigns and mothers of their people they always connived  at their slaughter by an infuriated populace as soon as they  became an insupportable burthen to the community and were  no longer acceptable to themselves Indeed the principle  carried out through necessity in a besieged city of expelling  every useless member had always been the ruling policy of  the monarchy of Apia and not only the male patricians who  never laboured in their lives but a portion even of the female  plebeians when from age unable to labour any more were  offered up a periodical sacrifice at the shrine of expediency  However shocking the above customs it would nevertheless  seem that like the bloody code of Draco they were salutary  at all events the political system of Apia worked well and the  perfection of its government as well as the industry of its  people was always universally extolled held up even for imi  tation by the various nations amongst whom the queendom of  Apia and her sister states were located and to whom they  paid tribute  To return to our narrative on the occasion of the great  event wherewith it opens there occurred the deficiency above  spoken of an heir was wanting to fill the vacant throne  Sincere as was their mourning the loyal subjects of the  queen defunct soon ceased idly to bewail her loss and while  the majority resumed their usual avocations a select com  mittee was appointed to the important business of making  an artificial sovereign out of a piece of plebeian stuff to supply  the place of a naturalborn princess As a preliminary to this  process a party of work women was instantly employed to pull  down a number of ordinary dwellings for the erection on the  same site of several most spacious royal nurseries and in the  performance of this business so little was the regard paid to  the poor occupants of these humble tenements that a parcel of  helpless children sleeping unconsciously in their cradles were  crushed beneath the ruins This proceeding would certainly  appear of a somewhat cruel and arbitrary character but the  rule of Apia was as we have said the rule of expediency  and who can say that there is nothing at all resembling it  among ourselves now groaning beneath the iron rule not of  royal but of railway despotism No doubt however by  the twentieth century all similar crushings of people in the  way will be numbered amongst the barbarisms of a by  gone age  From the little lowborn Apians thus carelessly sacrificed  several were selected in case of accidents to become recipients  of the royal elixir and tenants of the palace nurseries We  shall now visit a quarter of the Apian city where under the  hands of workwomen both diligent and numerous the new  erections were rising as if by magic on the ruins of the late  humble habitations Not far from and within view of the  busy scene stood a group of idlers chiefly composed you may  be sure of some of those idlers by profession the four hundred  gentlemen hangerson of royalty deceased With these how  ever were seen intermingled on the present occasion two or  three aged and decrepit females of the workingclass of  those permitted to hold for awhile on sufferance their doomed  and joyless lives They were strange companions those young  lazy lordlings and those workworn crazy crones but times of  public excitement are wont to bring together strange gossips  and there was at least one thing in common the common fate  which usually awaited them between the opposite individuals  now met Well really drawled one of the young nobles  to a brother idler as he looked up listlessly at the building  operations if theyre not getting on famously The manu  factory will be built in no time and then theyll presently  turn us out another royal mistress and cam sposa mine my  lord or yours as may be  The companion to whom this speech was addressed shrugged  his shoulders looked cautiously around and then returned in  a tone almost inaudible Tve been thinking whether we  might not dispense with any such personage at all What  exclaimed the other starting his large dull eyes almost spark  ling with astonishment at the unheardof notion Do without  our queen our light our life our loadstar Surely my  lord thou hast been quaffing too freely of the funereal nectar  and art beside thyself Our very existence depends upon  the smiles of our royal mistress The disloyal and bold  suggestor of a new idea answered only by a low sound  resembling in meaning a contemptuous laugh and the audible  sneer was echoed though in a shriller key by one of the aged  females who had been listening to the discourse in which she  now ventured to take a part In good sooth master mine  said she thou hast said right thy own existence and that  of all thy brethren did verily depend on the pleasure of her  majesty deceased and as her majestyinmaking will be  finished exactly after the same pattern why on her pleasure  they will depend also the which gracious pleasure or what  amounts to the same gracious permission will be that your  throats are cut every one of you before the summer is over  How how what say you mistress exclaimed both the  speakers and several other of their lounging lordships who  had gradually augmented the group The dark old female  chuckled like a witch when her charms work well and with a  sarcastic leer continued Yes my masters a weighty ob  ligation truly you were under to our late most excellent  sovereign and with reason do you pay her memory all becoming  deference Hearken to her royal virtues innocent as a lamb  gentle as a dove see how her acts bespoke her Amiable lady  no sooner had she arrived at reigning age than inspired with  noble jealousy she with her own hands murdered her sister  princesses Then how laudably did she live in pompous state  surrounded by your lordships and the rest of her courtly  retinue while we her people supported her by the sweat of  our brows How gratefully did she repay our labour by orders  not for pensions but for executions as soon as age should  render us incapable of toil How dignified her exemption from  all cares of government concerning which she would have  thought it the lowest degradation to have troubled her royal  head Above all my noble masters how tender and disinterested  were the favour and protection extended to yourselves so long as  you could minister to her delight how humane to spare your  wounded feelings by giving you up to slaughter as assuredly  she would have done so soon as her pleasure in you was at an  end Such were the brilliant qualities such the noble deeds  of her majesty departed and such while our queens continue  to be made after one model will be the qualities and doings  of her majesty forthcoming What can you desire better  The lordlings looked at one another in blank astonishment  With the exception of one frightful feature that of their own  simultaneous massacre with which they were of course not  personally acquainted they could not deny the accuracy of the  old crones royal portrait yet owing to the new light in which  she had placed it it appeared altogether in new and alarming  colours They not only looked at each other but they looked  at the building in progress murmurs arose Well have  no such tyrant no such cruel mistress to rule over us Well  attack the royal nurseries and kill all the royal nurslings in  their cradles And then they looked as fierce as any  Bobadil or Drawcansir They even put their hands to their  sides as if to feel for weapons forgetting at the moment  that the males of Apia were never privileged to carry arms  about them They forgot too that the royal buildings  were protected both by workwomen and guardswomen and  that the bulk of the people indeed the entire population  save only the superannuated were for the queeninfeeding  being all devotedly attached to royalty after the old model  All this the lords had forgotten but it was only for a moment  the next they remembered it out went their little sparks of  courage and they looked less vacant but more blank than  ever They must submit quietly to let the new queen be made  after the old pattern and allow themselves par consequence to  be done to death as their fathers had ever been before them  But the cunning old female was made of other stuff For  shame my lords said she why droop ye There are  other weapons besides the sword and though in virtue of my  sex I wear one on the present occasion Tis a useless remedy  However gentlemen I know a better trick I am old and  have long laboured in the haunts of those gigantic creatures  who call themselves our masters but I have laboured not only  like my sisterhood to collect within their wide domain of the  stores requisite for our provision but also to glean a know  ledge of their arts and sciences not a few of which I find them  to have borrowed from ourselves Indeed although they  boast themselves superior to our race they have always cried  up the merits of our ancient institutions lamentably defective  as they are Tor many ages even till the beginning of the  present century these wiseacres were contented enough with  what they called hereditary sovereigns poor bungling tools  as bad as ours or worse but now having at length taken  the hint from us they have learned to manufacture their own  sovereigns as we our queens only after a much more clever  and complete method We with our boasted elixir of certain  and invariable properties stuff and stimulate body and mind  into an invariable shape converting what would have been a  useful active member of society into an enormous bloated  idle cruel tyrant They by means of a wondrous art called  mesmerism acting on mind according as they please contrive  to expand the virtues and repress the vicious propensities of  their infant subject be it of royal or of humble birth till they  turn out of their moral laboratories paragons of princes and  princesses such as were never before known since the world  began Now of this most curious art and mystery you must  know my lords that I have picked up quite enough to model  you as pretty a queen as any subject need desire Get me but  a place within yonder royal nursery and  Ill do I ll do I ll do l  Then under a sovereign truly of our own making shall we me  chanics and labourers of the community when like myself worn  out with toil receive some better recompense than destitution  or death and you my masters instead of ending by the same  a short if pleasant life shall be permitted by a kind and gentle  mistress to enjoy your libations love and leisure even to the  term of your natural existence  Here a mingled hum of surprise and approbation succeeded  to the silence which had reigned during the speech of the aged  sibyl Personal interest had aroused her hearers from their usual  drowsy apathy and anxious for a reform of royalty which was so  greatly to benefit themselves they were eager to test the reality  of the old dames pretensions by doing all they could to for  ward her desire It may seem strange that the male patrician  order worthless as we have described it should have possessed  any influence at all with the Amazonian people of Apia but  the latter well knew how necessary these idlers would have  been for a season to the sovereign defunct and that as they  would be no less so to her successsor then in making they  THE NEW SOVEREIGNS  243  were just at the present juncture of vast importance in the  state Their recommendation was therefore promptly at  tended to and the aged professor of the mesmeric art soon  found herself chief superintendent of the royal nurseries  Here she continued working her secret charms until the  young plebeian plants forced into royalty were sufficiently  grown up for transplantation  When amongst several princesses whether royal born or  only royal bred one happened to be considerably older than  the others she was always in the habit as a matter of Apian  custom of murdering her little sisters even in their cradles  but when as on the present occasion all were nearly of  equal age it was usual that the succession should be settled  between them by single combat a procedure to which they  never wanted any prompting save the bloodthirsty jealousy  of their dispositions It had not however been for nothing  that the headnurse mesmeriser had been promoted to her  influential place The crone had worked like a witch indeed  and strange the magic of her doings with her tender charges  of whom three only arrived at maturity and that together  Now was the time of struggle for empire or for death but  instead of what usually took place neither of the trio  showed the smallest disposition to lord or lady it above  her fellows In vain did the populace anxious that  one alone which they cared not should reign over them  form a capacious ring around what ought to have been  the arena for the royal combatants Instead of drawing  their weapons as became their artificial rank the gentle  maidens sat or paraded side by side took hold of each  others arms whispered in each others ears and kept  looking as prim and pleasant as boardingschool young ladies  on an exhibition night The people were astounded the lords  alone delighted at what seemed to promise the entire completion  of what had been undertaken by their old confederate with  whom they ever and anon contrived to exchange a furtive wink  But what was to be done Three queens at once an  Amazonian triumvirate Such a thing was quite unexampled  in the annals of Apia Meetings were held among the people  who finally agreed that their crown must be made elective and  that one of the young candidates if so they might be called  should be chosen to wear it Yet the choice itself was not  without embarrassment the young virgins were as much alike  as three peas or the three sides of an equilateral triangle  Still people will differ about three straws and will declare  violent preferences where they would be puzzled to discern a  difference Accordingly from the unambitious spirit of these  sovereigns fresh from the mint who cared as little for the  crown as if they had been so many Ladies Jane Gray arose a  party spirit till then unknown within the realm of Apia Each  of the lamblike ladies soon became the nominal head of a furious  wolflike faction and the din first of wordy quarrels then of  clashing weapons resounded through the Amazonian monarchy  Industry languished the arts of peace were neglected instead  of as usual the fall in single combat of a few supernumerary  scions of royalty the most useful members of society were  swept off by hundreds in general engagements until at length  tired of contention the parties agreed to a compromise and  one of the princesses chosen by lot was placed upon the long  vacant throne the others being amiably contented to officiate  as her maids of honour  Hitherto it had been the custom of the sovereigns of Apia  either left to nature or made up after her original receipt to  take little part in the affairs of government being quite satisfied  with permission to gratify their ruling passions of love and  jealousy Not long however had the new modelled queen been  seated on the throne before her softened disposition began  farther to unfold itself in her frequently proposed schemes for  the imagined welfare of her subjects but the latter ardently  attached to their ancient institutions considered her benevolent  innovations in the light of anything rather than a boon The  old mesmeric queenmaker and her superannuated companions  together with the luxurious nobles were not disappointed  indeed of the personal benefit for which they had been con  federate The former were permitted to spin out to its extreme  length the attenuated thread of their existence the reformed  queen having acquired an organ of Philoprogenitiveness  greatly too large to allow of the destruction even of the most  useless of her subjects The lives of the nobles were of course  on the same ground considered sacred and they were now  favoured not only by the perpetual smiles of their gentle mis  tress whose Amativeness had been permanently developed  but by those also of her no less gentle maids of honour They  toyed they feasted and they slept no dreams of death  warrants no visions of massacre now haunting their re  pose The working people who be it remembered were all  respectable spinsters began to look grave still they toyed  The starving people began to look glum still they feasted  The angry people began to look fierce still they slumbered  for they relied on the tender constancy of their royal mistress  who had the will to protect them and the loyalty tf her  faithful subjects to whom however they might look her will  was yet a law So for awhile it lasted but darker storms  were brewing Woe to the ancient monarchy of Apia  Safe for so many ages while led by the clear unerring lamp  of instinct a stolen ray from the sun of reason had been  furtively introduced into her very heart and the Promethean  fire bade fair to involve her in a destructive blaze The people  of Apia though ignorant of all theories of political economy  the Malthusian among the number were intuitively alive to  the dangers of redundant population One of their methods  of reducing such political plethora has already been recorded  namely that periodic bloodletting wont to be effected by the  wholesale massacre of all useless members of the state but  this rigorous measure would have been wholly insufficient  without another aid that of emigration which was also yearly  resorted to In this most loyal if not most monarchical of  states nothing could be done without the presence of the  queen who indeed as the only matron was truly the mother of  her subjects and it had always been the custom whenever a  party of colonizers set forth for the reigning sovereign either  to lead or accompany them a young princess being always  kept guarded in a snug corner safe from her elders jealousy  and in readiness to fill her vacant place Never was emigra  tion more requisite than at the period which followed the  accession of the new mesmermodelled queen Her totally  subdued Destructiveness having led her to spare her two  royal rivals these having long since given up their places as  maids of honour had become as well as herself wives and  mothers of a numerous progeny and the same benevolising  influence having caused her as we have seen to spare the lives  both of the aged and of the idle of the community the hive  had never before been so overflowing with inhabitants or so  deficient in provisions for their support Death and threatened  famine were the result and emigration under the present  humanized order of things the only remedy but both the  reformed queen and the princesses either of whom the wouldbe  emigrants would have been content to follow were much too  domestic or spiritless to lead them Collected in a hungry  crowd they wanted only a royal conductress to desert their  native in search of a distant home but no such leader could  be found Fuming with impatience the anger of the famished  populace like the turbulence of a sea checked in its progress  rose the higher from obstruction With hoarse murmurs they  approached the precincts of the court rolled onwards to the  palace and retreated not till they had swept away in their  unbounded fury those who were its unworthy objects the  idle and rapacious favourites whose tragic fate so long sus  pended no queenly commands no womanly entreaties could  now avert Of these not one survived to tell the tale of their  extermination But here the fury of the multitude was  stayed the four hundred lives of the hapless nobles including  the prince or princesconsort had appeased it and the persons  of the queen and her sister widows were sacred in the eyes of  the people of Apia So long as a remnant of provision or of  strength to procure it lasted the royal trio knew not the  pangs of hunger beneath which hundreds were daily perishing  around them The young of the community wanting their  accustomed food and usual attendance perished also in great  numbers and some yet in a state of infancy were overlooked  amidst the general distress and suffered to corrupt within  their cradles This together with the long crowded state of  the metropolis soon invited pestilence to fill up the measure  of destruction already wrought by her sisters war and famine  and from the hand of pestilence no rank or loyalty could save  Among those who first fell beneath her deadly grasp were  the queen and princesses leaving as often happened amidst  a numerous progeny no royal heirs The queenmaking  elixir had been every drop secretly thrown away by the old  mesmeric superintendent of the royal nurseries and the season  was past for collecting those rare vegetable essences of which  it was wont to be composed Had it indeed been otherwise  there were none able to travel in search of them The  wretched remnant of the people whose very life lay centered in  their sovereign now cared not to survive Their spring of  action and of industry was gone and surrounding the corpse  of their late mistress they raised her monumental mound with  their own wasted bodies  Thus came to destruction the ancient Amazonian monarchy  of Apia but before her ruin was complete the worker of the  mighty mischief the aged sibyl who had dared to filch wisdom  or folly from a higher race who had meddled in matters too  lofty for her handling had met with her reward On the  arrival of famine she and her infirm companions were its  earliest victims thus falling by a fate more frightful because  more lingering than that which awaited them under the  ancient order of things   The happy people in their waxen cells  Sit tending public cares  We must now treat of Bees as a body politic our reform  episode may not require a key but it shall have an appendix  We cannot for one moment suppose any of our readers so  ignorant of the hives economy as not to have discovered in  the jealous vindictive fertile adulated sovereign the queen  mother of the Apiary in her numerous spinster subjects busied  in all cares and labours but those of maternity and some even  which to that more properly belong the workers of the same  called neuters though in fact imperfect females and in the  idle luxurious parasitic lords of the Apian court the lazy  drones which live on others labour  We shall now relate a few facts concerning the economy of  Bees stripped of the fanciful attire wherein we have taken the  liberty of dressing them  If any form of government be faultless it must be one acting  immediately under divine guidance and of this class are the  instinctive institutions of social animals which are therefore  perfect in their kind Under an idea of such perfection  erroneously applied the people of the hive have been held up  to ns people of the earth not only as patterns of industry  but also of political economy and have been cited not only as  arguments for monarchy but as models also of monarchical  government That men might nevertheless just as well  attempt to build their cities after the pattern of a honeycomb  as to mould their institutions after those of the honeycombos  inhabitants is evidenced we should think even in our little  romance Leigh Hunt has painted in amusing colours the  egregious absurdity of such an imitation and the same will  appear every whit as strongly in the following outline sketch  of the interior of a hive  Insect societies such as those of Bees Wasps Ants and  White Ants or Termites are in fact things sui generis  standing by themselves they present natural pictures to which  throughout the animal kingdom no pendants are to be found  and it is this which makes them doubly interesting A well  peopled hive consists of one queen several hundred males or  drones and many thousand workers the latter of which are all  imperfect females though bearing no resemblance either in  size or habits to the pampered individual who nominally fills  the throne and actually fills the hive by supplying its abundant  population  The royal female to whom this endowment of surpassing pro  ductiveness forms the very charter of her authority the very  bond by which she holds the hearts of her devoted subjects  derives from character but slender claims on their respect  During the entire period of her life and reign which is generally  estimated at about two or three years she performs not a single  labour for the good of the community save that of increasing  its numbers and her bulky body is seldom roused from its  wonted state of luxurious indolence except when her royal  spirit is chafed by the influence of vindictive jealousy  The queen of the hive born like the queens of earth no  better than her meaner sisterhood like them issues from the  egg a helpless grub but the chamber of her birth as compared  with theirs is of right royal dimensions vertical in position  and of cylindric instead of octagonal form Ample room is  thus afforded for the full expansion and development of all her  members as she progresses towards maturity while to hasten  and improve her growth the food supplied her by her assiduous  nurses and future subjects is of the most nutritious and delicate  description not the simple Beebread composed of common  pollen and considered good enough for common Beeinfancy  but a rare and curious preparation nicely concocted from flowery  juices and as reserved expressly for royal nutriment called  by Beefarmers royal jelly Thus spaciously lodged and  delicately fed the favoured grub when arrived at full growth  spins within her cell a silken shroud therein changes to a  nymph or pupa and thence in due time issues forth in all  her dignity of majestic size in all the resplendency of her  goldenringed bodysuit the more conspicuous for the scantiness  of her gauze drapery those filmy wings in which alone her  outward gifts instead of surpassing are inferior to those of  her subjects  Come we now to the busy workers of whom the numerous  sisterhood the million of the hive is made up From these  the Bee character has been always painted and painted justly  as loyal and patriotic laborious patient and skilful to which  might be added maternally affectionate for though never  mothers themselves the latter propensity possesses them so  strongly as to convert their office as nurses to the queens pro  geny to all in short of the infant community into what  would seem truly a labour of love Although their instinctive  virtues if we may use the term are so immeasurably expanded  beyond the narrow growth of those apparent in their royal  mistress compression is one of the agents employed to effect  this mighty difference between them and the worker Bee is  it would seem made a useful member of the body politic by a  process very similar to that which renders the foot of a Chinese  lady a somewhat useless member of her body natural  The baby Bee destined to become a Bee labourer finds  herself on emerging from the egg an inhabitant of one of those  common sixsided cells which as it would appear is so pro  portioned as in some measure to limit her growth and thus  prevent her from attaining her full development To this  outward restriction is superadded an inward check in the  quality of the food administered by her nurses In lieu of the  royal jelly that stimulating and nutritious extract prepared  only for the queen her infancy is supported on the simple fare  of Beebread which while it suffices to bring to maturity  every useful endowment of activity affords no food for the  development of the sensual and vindictive passions and with  all these smothered in the cradle our worker comes forth  mature in all Apian excellence modest in habits a nun  among Insects and a very sister of charity among her  fellows  Thus much for the queen and commonalty the females of  the hive and now for the three or four hundred of the opposite  sex who as partakers of the royal favour or as candidates for  the same as well as for their worthless qualities may fairly be  compared to the aristocracy of a state where birth not worth  makes the man We need not describe the Drone whether of  a biped or of a Bee community since the one is a pattern of  and lends name to the other The chief difference between  them is this that biped Drones are to be seen every day of the  year while Beedrones are to be only seen because they are  only allowed to exist during those days of summer which  intervene betwixt April and August And truly living as  they do to eat a quarters span of luxurious existence at the  expense of those who only eat to live is a tolerably fair pro  portion Such at least would seem to be the opinion of the  workers of the hive for the queen having meanwhile chosen  a royal partner or partners from among them the whole  three or four hundred fall by a general massacre towards the  end of July or early in August The Amazonian city is thus  rid of all useless mouths before winter with her icy batteries  lays siege to its strawbuilt outworks and waxen walls  Have those by whom Bee economy has been held up for  human imitation ever thought about the awful consequences  which would be involved in even a partial copy of the above  severely wholesome policy  Having now glanced separately at each of the anomalous  classes of a Bee community its matron queen who possesses  no political authority and performs no matronly duties its com  monalty of single females endowed with every manly and at  the same time matronly virtue and its nobility of males the  most insignificant and most effeminate of all we shall take  another look at them as they stand together socially related  Let us suppose ourselves one moonlight evening in May  taking a garden stroll beside a range of Beehives Instead of  the nightly stillness which is wont in Bee cities to succeed the  daily hum there arises from one of these a loud uneasy  murmur which instead of lessening continues to increase with  the lateness of the hour Our hive is not of glass but if it  were the restlessness thus audible without would become  apparent within by the evidences of crowding confusion  and jostling by all the tokens in short usually attendant  on some grand event in expectation From so violent a ferment  of vitality something must of necessity arise but through the  livelong night nothing comes of it and the morning sun rises  on nothing but the same scene and sound of agitated turmoil  Erom tokens such as these an ordinary keeper of Bees  would merely surmise that a swarm was coming and an old  fashioned village dame would be sure by this time to be getting  in readiness her fryingpan and iron ladle to ring the parting  colony to their new abode But there are those who have pre  tended to see much farther through Bee confusion and to enter  much deeper into Bee councils In the midst of all this bustle  of movement and Babel of sound they would distinguish shrill  above the murmur of her subjects the authoritative voice of the  queenmother about to lead or at all events to accompany the  departing swarm of emigrants They doubtless would be able  to report correctly the sovereigns harangue on this important  occasion more full doubtless of significance than royal  speeches are wont to be combining the pathetic the dictatorial  and the cheering farewell and counsel to the body of her  people to be left at home command and encouragement to the  party about to attend her to a new settlement  Midday now approaches the royal speech is ended the  applauding murmurs have subsided farewells are taken and the  body of emigrants rush forth headed or it may be followed by  their sovereign lady These however we mean not to accom  pany even to the adjacent bough on which they have settled  most likely for a temporary rest because we shall see more by  keeping to the parent hive through the portal of which we  must fairy like effect a passage at this epoch of interest and  importance the loss of its queen with a large proportion of  its population Row upon row of hexagonal houses hang  suspended in clusters from a common roof Most of them are  occupied some as storehouses for honey and Beebread others  as nurseries for Beeinfancy and where not otherwise engaged  as dormitories for Beelabourers who with heads and shoulders  ensconced within their cells are accustomed at intervals thus  to turn their backs on labour and recruit for fresh exertions  But few enough are the slumberers now taking their repose  the grand event of the morning has raised a general commotion  by no means subsided with the absence of its immediate cause  from which mighty effects are yet about to spring  Brom the departure of their reigning monarch and queen  mother our amazonian citizens are for the present queenless  What a predicament for a people whose very spring of action  is set in motion as we have seen by loyalty but it is an  exigence to meet which they are well provided Among the  common sixsided cells which compose the mass of building  are perceived some halfdozen oval structures of more than  thrice their size which are occupied as abodes of growing  royalty and within these waxen palaces have been for some  weeks nurtured in different stages of progression towards matu  rity as many young princesses for one of which the vacant  throne is destined Bor which of them is the question which  priority of birth and emergement from one of the cells of state  is now to settle for at present all these quiescent candidates  for sovereignty are swathed in the silken shrouds of their  second or chrysalis stage of being that wherein Bees are  designated by the name of Nymphs With heads turned  towards the royal apartments the queenless subjects anxiously  await the moment which is to supply their craving for a sove  reign They wait long but at length most welcome spectacle  a royal lady perfect in the maturity of her full proportions  issues from one of the royal chambers A loud and joyful  hum proclaims her queen and her subjects are crowding round  to pay their ready homage when lo from another of the  state apartments arrived like herself at Bees and queens  estate and nearly at the selfsame moment comes forth a second  claimant to the regal honours The rivals catch a glimpse of  each other exchange a glance of angry defiance then while the  crowd falls back to permit their meeting rush like shedragons  on one another Head to head chest to chest they strive and  grapple and each has only in dragon sort to bend her tail  and fix her venomed dart and both will fall victims to each  others stings But no at this moment as if seized simul  taneously with panic fear they part and recede from the deadly  and too equal strife  The spectators have hitherto been looking on inactive  though not mute having kept up a ceaseless hum but now  that the royal combatants give way and separate that hum  increases to a perfect uproar and a few individuals darting  from the crowd dare to seize upon the retreating queens and  stay their flight to hang even on their recreant limbs  and hold them back from further retreat as well as from ad  vance But see as if their failing spirits were chafed into  new fury by the indignity thus offered they burst from their  subjects hold and rush back to the encounter Again the  issue hangs suspended but not for long for now one of the  queenly combatants more powerful or more skilful than her  rival rises above her seizes one of her scanty wings and inflicts  on her undefended body a mortal sting She withdraws her  barbed weapon while her wounded competitor falls down  drags her huge length along then struggles and expires  The conquerors victory is complete and now surely she will  rest proudly satisfied with her success in fair and equal combat  But what does she next What means she by approaching  rapidly to the nearest of the royal chambers where still sleeps  unconscious one of the four remaining nymphs of royal  breeding With vindictive fury she tears from its entrance  the silken tapestry by which it is partially defended and now  she thrusts into the aperture her poisoned dart and inflicts on  the helpless occupant a fatal wound Her thirst for rival  blood still rages unabated another hapless nymph and yet  another dies for its assuagement and she ceases not from the  work of murder until her victims and her strength fail together  While the ferocious queen is thus employed what is the  behaviour of her surrounding subjects Do they submit  tamely to the extinction of the royal race Yes and they  do more for though they themselves lay not a sting on the  sacred persons of the young princesses they aid the cruel  queen in the completion of her butchery for no sooner does  she quit each scene of her successive assassinations than drag  ging from the chamber the body she has left they hasten to  hide from view the evidence of her jealous fury  The scene above depicted reads it must be owned exceed  ingly tragic and with such materials for a Play upon the  Passions well may Bees have been made to figure as Dramatis  Personas and have had allotted them to use the words of a  modern writer a whole play to themselves Of this play  we know nothing except that it was written in the reign of  Elizabeth who ought to have been the play writers patron  for what could be more harmonious with her ruling passion than  the part enacted by the queenly Bee made as we presume his  heroine She before whom to allude to a successor was in her  own words to pin up her windingsheet before her face  how would she have borne a rival near her throne  However and as must be by this time pretty evident the  things which would be highly unbecoming among men and  women are exceedingly wellordered among Bees It seems  quite essential to the welfare of a hive to acknowledge only one  sovereign but as on this single sovereign in her capacity of  general mother not only the welfare but the very existence of  the state depends and as over and above no emigration can  take place without a queen to accompany the swarm a surplus  number of royal nymphs is no less requisite to meet contin  gences It will sometimes however happen that notwith  standing such provision a hive is unexpectedly bereft of its  sovereign when no successor is existing to supply her place  How then do the people act Why they do in such a strait  exactly what has been told and what in sober seriousness  we will repeat for lack of a queen readymade they make  one  For the space of several hours grief and consternation reign  in place of the defunct sovereign Then do the murmuring  but not despairing mourners bestir themselves to supply her  place But how are they to do it Can they mould from  their ready material wax a royal effigy and then breathe life  into the image Not so but they can resort for the supply  of their exigence to an expedient almost as miraculous Let  us watch their proceedings in the creation of a queen Why  this work appears only a labour of destruction Surely they  are bereft not only of their sovereign but also of their senses  and in a fit of frenzy are making havoc in the streets of this  wellordered city Several parties are here and there attacking  the sixsided houses hastily pulling down their waxen walls  regardless of the young which lie cradled within Out of  perhaps four or five of these unhappy nurslings all but one  are sacrificed by those who had heretofore been their careful  nurses but for this one still in its infant or grub estate a  changed and brilliant destiny is in store Save for the un  lookedfor accident which has left the throne without an  occupant this lowborn Bee straitly housed and poorly fed  would have left her cell in size and form and colour like the  rest of its working sisterhood and like them would have led  a life of labour but now her body will be expanded her  organs developed her colours brightened her wings and in  stinctive virtues alone being curtailed  The first process of her manufacture is begun already by the  destruction going on around her Her narrow lodging by the  sacrifice of those adjacent is converted into a spacious chamber  allowing full scope for her bodily expansion and soon will  numerous nurses be busy cramming her with that nutritious  stimulating substance called royal jelly Then in due  season in ten days or thereabouts out will come an artificial  sovereign in all respects as good as ever issued from a royal egg  The above curious process of conversion though supposed to  have been known to the ancients was first published by Schirach  a Trench naturalist in his history of La Beine des Abeilles  Although the fact was ascertained by careful experiment its  assertors were for a long time laughed at and even abused in  one case by an opponent who though he saw nothing incre  dible in the conversion of plants into animals deemed it the  height of absurdity that the nature of an animal should admit  of change  Of Bees under different aspects there is yet an infinity to  be told We may look again into the hive but those who  wish to dive deeply into the ways and wonders the proceedings  and policies of its busy inmates must consult the works of  Bee historians Delightful pages some of them have written  reading much like human history only more agreeably because  undefiled by moral blots They tell us it is true that Bees  go to war like human communities that strong Bees rob the  weak like human villains that angry Bees fight single  combats like human duellists that Bees wellfed and vigorous  will kill the old and helpless of their labourers These  are points of character rough and sharp enough it must be  owned but they need not prick us in the reading when we  remember that Bees are but the passive elements of an unerring  instinct  MOTHS AS DESTRUCTIVES  Now busily convened upon the bud  That crowns the genial branch they feast sublime  And spread their muslin canopy around  Pavilioned richer than the proudest kings  The grand army of Mothdestructives is now in all the  activity of a spring campaign According to their local distri  bution these may be considered as attacking us under four  principal divisions each subdivided into numerous companies  One of them is employed on what we may call the out works  our fields and foresttrees a second coming nearer spoliates  and levies contributions on our gardens a third more daring  invades our granaries while a fourth boldest of all attacks  the citadel and makes havoc in our houses When we thus  speak of Moths as destructives we refer of course to the con  suming excesses of their caterpillar youth wherein Butterflies  also before they have cast off their grosser humours play an  auxiliary part but the main body of crawling invaders is made  up of those which will become in due season fliers not of the  day but of the night or evening Of all these it is only the  domestic destroyers of the wardrobe which are generally as  Moths accustomed to be looked on with alarm because it is  with these only and not often with their fellows of the field  that people are accustomed to identify as one the consuming  crawler and the harmless flutterer  To begin now with the first division of our numerous army  those defoliating marauders with whom forest trees and  hedgerows are the chief objects of attack Among the most  formidable invaders of the oak are certain caterpillar broods  whose earliest infant steps are accustomed to be taken over the  surface of a leaf which they traverse in marching order Of  these there are some distinguished regiments often to be seen  late in August drawn up in regular files and in their brilliant  uniforms of scarlet black and white as well as in their mar  shalled array requiring no great effort of imagination to liken  them to Lilliputian soldiery Each of these infant legions in pre  paratory exercise for operations on a grander scale strips off its  rations from the upper surface of the leaf it traverses leaving  all behind it brown and arid while all before is fresh and  verdant perfect image in the compass of an oakleaf of the  progress of a marauding army of a worse description  Our youthful invaders of the forest are not strong enough  to brave an inclement season without shelter No sooner  therefore do the changing hues of autumn begin to threaten  them with failure of their supplies than with instinctive  foresight they begin to prepare cantonments for the winter  and long before the arrival of November we may behold  our oakleaf companies snugly housed in branchsuspended  barracks consisting of hammocks spun by themselves of  thicklywoven silk Quartered in these in social congrega  tion and bidding defiance to howling winds and nipping  frosts which only serve to rock them to repose or numb  them to torpor they pass the season of death and rigour but  with the return of spring the caterpillar army is again on foot  sharpened in appetite but not improved in discipline for  instead of as heretofore marching in files and messing  together on a single leaf they disperse like disbanded and  insubordinate soldiers each to forage on the new and tender  foliage  Yet awhile perhaps towards the beginning of July and  we pass beneath some illfated oaktree on which the legion  has been actively engaged Where now proud monarch of  the woods are thy verdant honours P Where that crown of  royalty which when other leafy coronets are falling around  thee is wont to be only gilded by the suns of autumn and  still held fast often glows the richer even for the blasts of  winter That diadem once accustomed to lord it over the  seasons has been stripped from thy brow by a vile caterpillar  crew But where are the destroyers Aftqr having battened  in this sort upon crowned heads and fattened upon regal  spoils our marauding troops should each by this time have  grown Napoleonlike in figure as in deed And so in their  day they did their black and scarlet uniforms having for  many a time been renewed in order to accommodate their  growing greatness but now their day is over These ruthless  ravagers are nowhere to be seen But what have we here  resting on the shady side of an oaks spoliated trunk A little  creature of surpassing elegance and beauty her body seems  clothed in a garment of softest swans down trimmed at the  bottom by a flounce of golden fur her ample wings of the  same unsullied hue but of more satiny appearance are bor  dered by a corresponding fringe and even her delicate feet  are furred or feathered with white nearly to her toes Her  full black eyes though lacking lustre do not lack beauty and  rising from her head in graceful curves a pair of snowwhite  plumes complete her simple but most elegant attire We  might almost fancy as we look at this most delicate of creatures  that we had surprised by daylight one of the fairy elves fabled  to hold their moonlight revels beneath the oak And truly she  is not more beautiful than innocent a drop of honeydew is  the coarsest nutriment her frame requires if even air suffice  not to support it But what has she in common or what  has she to do with the greedy ruthless strippers of the noble  tree she rests on Everything She has with them a com  mon origin sheis the Goldtail moth and they were the  Goldtail caterpillars of which she once was one and of a  brood of which she will most likely become the parent  We would fain have been able to carry to an end the analogy  between our Insect ravagers of foliage and the human ravagers  of earth but when the latter have been summoned from the  scenes where they have reaped their harvests of devastation  who can picture them as assuming in a higher sphere the  white and spotless robes of innocence There remains but  little more to be said en naturaliste descriptive of the Gold  tail either in its form of destruction or of beauty In the  former however that of caterpillar we shall describe its   black and scarlet uniform 99 with somewhat more preci  sion and for a reason which will presently appear Its body  coat of black velvet is enlivened by two stripes of brilliant  scarlet down the middle of the back a row of white resem  bling embroidery running along each side and again below  these two other scarlet lines The head and sixclawed feet  are shining black the hinder and intermediate legs yellowish  and the whole body beset with tufts of goldbrown hair Now  upon these hairs which we since last May have had good  reason to remember hangs a tale of which Noli me tang ere 99  is the moral Before having by experience learnt it we one  day happened to transpose some of the Goldtail feeders  from a hedge to our collectingbox The said Goldtails in  return transferred to our glove some dozen perhaps of their  defensive hairs which lastly were retransferred unconsciously  to our face and throat Irritation and inflammation were  presently the consequences proved by subsequent experiment  to have proceeded indubitably from this caterpillar cause the  handling of which incautiously or with hands ungloved may  give others as well as ourselves occasion for repentance We  would advise our collecting friends to bear this in recollection  The havoc occasionally wrought by these caterpillars of the  Goldtail and those of the Browntail a closelyallied moth  has been recorded as matter of history Beaumur when  travelling between Tours and Paris in September 1731 found  every oak in possession of one of these devastating legions  the foliage looking parched and embrowned as if by lightning  This was the work of innumerable companies of leafmarching  infantry such as those we have described After spinning and  spending the winter in their warm silken hammocks they re  appeared in the ensuing spring marking their passage through  grove and garden as if with fire and sword So extensive  became the evil and so mighty the alarm that the parliament  of Paris issued an edict for the raising of conscript armies to  exterminate the crawling invaders in other words to compel  the people to go forth and decheniller les arbres a work  perhaps beyond human power but in which they were assisted  if not anticipated by the providential auxiliary of a cold rainy  May Some fifty years later a similar panic from a similar  cause set England in a ferment of alarm The extensive ravages  of the Browntails obtained for them on this occasion the dis  tinction of an historic volume The poor in the vicinity of  London were employed to cut off their webs or hammocks  at a shilling a bushel fourscore of which were said to have  been collected at Clapham in one day and though these  devourers are no consumers either of grass or grain it was  ignorantly supposed that as with the northern armies of  the East famine and pestilence were likely to follow in their  train to avert which calamities public prayers were offered up  Attached to the same division of the caterpillar army there  are certain corps of tiny light infantry whose white encamp  ments are in some seasons conspicuous upon every hedge  in May and June Merciless leafstrippers as they are they  would yet seem to have a touch of compassion in their cruelty  inasmuch as they often clothe in a measure with their silken  tissues the unfortunate branches which they have reduced to  a state of nudity The regiments of Goldtail and Browntail  after a certain season are all as we have seen accustomed to  disband but those which we are now reviewing never break  company at all while wearing their caterpillar uniforms grey  and black or even when caparisoned in chrysalidan armour  of black and gold  Through May and early June they are to be seen within or  beside their silken tabernacles feeding close together in the  form of small grey caterpillars spotted with black after which  they are to be found as chrysalides black and yellow hung  pendant head downwards and side by side to the stalks and  branches most frequently of blackthorn which they have  united to strip bare Each chrysalis is veiled by a thin cocoon  of silk and a web of the same material encloses the whole  company which however is partially discernible through both  In July having then cast off both uniform and armour these  little devastators appear as Ermine Moths with silvery black  besprinkled wings harmless in outward seeming but the gene  rators of a multitude of mighty mischiefs  Leaving wood and hedgerow let us in May or even in April  walk through the garden and observe in what manner the second  division of our destroying army may be there employed Have  these intrusive devourers shown more respect to the queen of  flowers than to the monarch of the woods Not a whit and  see here the proof On almost every rosebud is a bundle of  young leaflets all drawn from their propriety and contrary to  their own expansive inclination bound together usually in a  fan like form by means of a silken tie If we pull asunder  the leaves thus unwillingly united we shall find living within  and upon them the agent of their union a little brown black  headed caterpillart Secure from wind and weather this little  imp here feasts at leisure and nips in the bud many an infant  rose whose cradling leaflets intended for its own protection  only serve to conceal the proceedings of its destroyer  Turning from rose to lilac we find numbers of its leaves  rolled up both cross and lengthwise their return to a natural  position being prevented by silken stays or braces These are  the rollings and weavings of a caterpillar which in due season  will become as its mother was before it a small chocolate  coloured moth like others a provident parent who took  good care to lay her eggs on the leaf best suited for the exercise  of her offsprings ingenuity and appetite  In the kitchen no less than in the flowergarden have  these parent moths been busy at our cost for their families  support Cabbages outwardly skeletons but still sound at  heart attest the presence of caterpillar ravagers but let us  not be hasty in condemnation For once a moth is not at the  bottom at the beginning more properly of the mischief  The maternal ancestor of these spoliators of the leaves of kale  has been no doubt a Cabbage Butterfly and her devouring  brood partaking in a measure of the character of their sun  delighting parent go to work openly on the exterior of the  plant But it is not so with the destructive progeny of that  nighthag moth known in some places as the Old Gentle  woman t which darkly dangerous penetrate and prey on the  very heart of the cabbage In England and particularly in  Wiltshire these caterpillars are reputed to do extensive damage  and in Germany woe to the lovers of sourkrout when this  lover of cabbages has visited the wtagere before them There  whole basketfuls of caterpillars are said in innocent and igno  rant simplicity to be buried alive only to rise living from  the earth for as observed by Roesel a native naturalist one  might as well expect to kill a crab by covering it with sea  water as thus to destroy a caterpillar which always burrows  under ground to change into a chrysalis  Among the destructives of orchard and kitchengarden  there is a race of very common brown Moths yclept the  Lackeys so called from the gaudy colouring of their cater  pillars variegated with stripes of blue black white and  scarlet These which are among the social feeders are in  some seasons most egregious social pests helping themselves  something after the manner of the class they are named from  to extravagant board in return for making a destructive show  The hopvine and the burdock are sometimes seen to droop  their leaves and stalks without any apparent cause The  rational might suppose them fainting under the influence of  summer heat the ignorant imagine them struck by what they  call a blight the fanciful would have declared in days of  greater superstition that they had been exposed to some Ci evil  eye of ghost or witch or goblin and as it happens a ghost  is really at the bottom of the mystery for a Ghost Moth in its  caterpillar shape is gnawing unseen at the root of the insect  haunted plant This is the White Ghost which often in the  shades of evening flits across our path chased by a dark pur  suing demon in the form of a bat who knows well enough  that for him the Ghost Moth is no airy shape but a substan  tial reality if not of flesh and blood of juices and muscles  which if happily attained will afford him a delicious supper  Our gooseberries and currants plums pears apples apri  cots and grapes are all both in foliage and in fruit more or  less subject to insect mischiefs of which parent Moths have  been the fertile sources  Quitting the garden for the homestead and the house we  now come to the third and fourth divisions of our consuming  host the domestic invaders of our granaries garments and  goodnature These belong chiefly to a family of tiny Moths  called Tinea distinguished as much for the ingenious formation  of their own habitations or clothing as for the ravages they  are accustomed to commit within and upon ours There is a  certain member of this Tinea family one of the smallest of  the crew which delights to play her pranks in the farmers  granary She there deposits perhaps a score of eggs on a  corn of wheat or of barley and no sooner are the caterpillar  mischiefs hatched than they disperse each choosing for himself  a single grain to be at once his habitation and his hoard  Gnawing an entrance scarce bigger than a pinhole the little  devourer takes possession revels in plenty and security and  towards autumn when his stock of flour is exhausted escapes  from the pinch of famine and the nip of frost into the gentle  arms of sleep having previously taken care to convert the  hollowed grain into a soft warm dormitory tapestried with  silk There in the form of chrysalis he slumbers through  the winter to burst forth with the spring an image of his  silver winged parent  We have just said that this tiny robber enters his barley  corn through a hole no bigger than that caused by a pin too  small therefore to afford egress to anything in the shape of a  Moth unless assumed by a veritable Fairy but this seeming  difficulty is entirely removed by one of those admirable con  trivances instinctive and prospective which are so frequently  met with in insect economy The last act of the little caterpillar  before it betakes itself to its winters nap is to shape with its  jaws a halfcut door way in the skin of the hollow grain which  though on the outside appearing whole presently gives way  when pushed from within for the exit of the newly winged Moth  Of the same Tinea family but distinguished from the Grain  Moths by their appetite for animal instead of vegetable food  are the wellknown Clothes Moths lovers of fur wool  tapestry and dried insect specimens Most people are well  enough acquainted to then cost with the destructive opera  tions of these wardrobe pests but some possibly may be  ignorant that muffs and silks and stuffs afford food not only  clothes moth  for their appetite but also for their constructive skill the little  marauders being accustomed to make for themselves out of  these materials what we may designate either habitations  or clothing movable tents or closely fitting bodycoats  Marauders though they be yet they can scarcely be called  invaders since individually they can assert a better claim  than that of conquest to the territory they lay waste for they  were born caterpillars on the property and therefore inherit  it in right of their ladymother Moth that flitting felon  who through crevice or keyhole intruded her fairy like form  and founded her hidden settlement This mode and manner  of its commencement deserves especial notice as contradicting  completely the notion still we believe partially entertained  that Moths are selfengendered in the fabrics they infest As  this is not the fact we have only to enwrap our furry treasures  carefully in linen so as to exclude all possible entrance to the  mother Moth and we never need fear the presence of her  caterpillar offspring  We open a muffbox drawer or wardrobe and first behold  with horror the winged offender or offenders we buffet them  in appeasement of our anger and vexation but if we do our  worst to them the worst of the mischief lurks behind and  must be nipped in the egg or in the caterpillar which strong in  the protection of the aforesaid bodycoat has set at nought our  impotent artillery of fumes brimstone camphor bay or laurel  Here we have one of the varlets in his self wrought case  Let us look and examine how he has contrived to make it  The foundation of his fabric is formed of silk of his own  spinning into which he has thickly interwoven portions of  fur so as to make himself a sort of muff at the expense of  ours taking for his purpose the longer and stiffer hairs leaving  for food the softest and shortest Upon this his furry pasture  as soon as his covering is completed and not before he  begins to regale at leisure an opening being left for the  protrusion of his head at one end of his movable encasing  garment He would rather die of hunger than feed uncovered  As its inmate or wearer fattens the case would become of  course too small but to meet this growing evil he lengthens  it by working in fresh hairs at each end at the same time  widening it by the insertion of pieces on each side By moving  these little tailors and setting them to work on various stuffs  we can cause them to make up regularly striped coats of many  colours  The Moth caterpillars of this family which attack wool  tapestry and the treasures of the cabinet go to work much in  the above manner with the different materials provided ready  to their mouths by the prospective care of their mothers  Those of the cabinet scruple not to make free with the wings  of their defunct fellowinsects cutting and clipping them into  convenient pieces for the shaping and strengthening of their  own bodycoats Another little destructive who is apt to make herself more  free than welcome within the precincts of our dwellings is  called the Tabby for what reason we cannot exactly tell  These Moths settle in our libraries and larders and their  numerous families are born and nurtured just also as it may  happen upon books or butter Their taste when literary is  however like that of many other bibliomaniacs somewhat  superficial having reference rather to the leather than the  language the binding rather than the body of the works is  the object of their esteem A Moth caterpillar of another  description dives however somewhat deeper into learned lore  and devouring the page adorned by mildew and blackletter  prizes books in proportion to their mouldiness rather than  their merit  Our Moth destructives have now been traced home to our  houses and our cabinets to the clothing of our bodies and the  works of our hands even to the productions of our brains  and by adopting them as emblems we may bring them closer  still What better than the tribe of domestic Moths can  serve for images of those evil principles which taking pos  session we scarce know when or how fret and defile the robes  of innocence And who of us alas ever guards so closely  the chinks and crevices of the moral wardrobe as not to give  admission to a few or many of this destructive race  Aglossa pinguinalis  The wealth and territories of the noble house of A  had for upwards of a century been gradually wasting away  In proportion as these diminished the Romancatholic chapel  attached to the family castle had declined from its ancient  splendour and on the earldom passing for one generation  into a Protestant branch it was permitted to reach the verge of  complete ruin  But behold now the holy edifice under process of restora  tion Where the voices of choristers once arose where the  mouldering rubbish lately fell there hammers are descending  Where the organ once pealed where the screechowl lately  hooted there masons are busy with the mallet and the chisel  Where clouds of incense were once rolling where the night  dews lately fell there whiffs of tobacco are rising through the  dilapidated roof A new order of things is at hand monu  mental knights whose spurs have been cut off by the scythe of  time are being newly invested by the aid of the sculptors  chisel whilst dames of chaste cold marble are receiving like  embellishment from Carpue an restorers of stone noses  But what is the magic power at whose bidding all these  wonders of renovation are produced The wizard is named  Wealth but from whence and in what shape has he been  evoked Has he arisen from the bowels of Lord A  wasted property in shape of a spirit of the mine Has he  descended heralded by the mockery of sable trappings from  some rich but barren branch collateral Or has the present  Earl realized the golden dream of an alchemising ancestor and  extracted the powerful spirit from the fumes of the crucible  In neither of these shapes and from neither of these sources  has arisen the magician who is working such changes in the  house of A The giant power has appeared as a Slave of  the Ring and has been evoked by a ceremony at the desecrated  altar The noble inheritor of the late Lord A s poverty  has intermarried with the ignoble heiress of a Lancashire  cottonspinner and this is why the old chapel is putting on  its new garment  It is evening The chapelrestorers whose work is well  nigh accomplished have all departed for the night and the  moon is looking through the great eastern window on the  scene of restoration on the renovated tombs the reblazoned  hatchments the repolished carvings the renewed hangings  and proudly conspicuous over all on a new banner which had  been raised that morning to replace an old one of which time  damp and moths had only left a tattered remnant  What a looking up of downcast fortunes is displayed and  typified in that coat of arms fresh from the hands of an  heraldic tailor Free from obscuring clouds that brilliant  Azure like a bright blue sky betokens and gives promise of  pleasant weather that fiery Gules tells of resuscitated splen  dours rising Phoenixlike from the ashes of the old even that  deepdyed S able shadows forth garments of lustrous newness  in lieu of faded rust but most of all significant is that re  gilded Or an actual emblem of the unseen agency which has  wrought these renovating changes  All is silent amidst these refurbished vanities and whited  sepulchres now more deathlike than before their outward re  suscitation for during its process the life which had been  harboured in this neighbourhood of mortality had become  extinguished or dislodged The owls had been driven from the  ivy the swallows from the roof without the bats from the  roof within the bloated spiders from the mildewed walls  the churchyard beetle and the deathwatch from the pave  ments and the wainscot It was only in the fragments of the  ancient banner cast down upon the flagstones just beneath  the new that any token of life remained Two Moths yet lin  gered herein the only two which had not been put to flight  by the noise and stir of renovation As the destructive pair  by turns glided or flitted over the dusty dishonoured relics   their silvery wings glancing in the moonlight they acquired  in the absence of all other visible existences an importance  not their own and in the eye of superstition might have  seemed as spirits burst from the tombs around spirits of the  brave who had often upreared that banner in its days of pride  and were now risen in sorrow and in anger to bewail its  downfall  Moths or mothlike spirits be they what they might  the two companions flitted now here now there then meet  ing laid their plumed heads together and commenced in  moth language a parley which we shall thus interpret   Sister cried one of them who had just descended on the  old banner from a short exploratory flight towards the new   why art thou thus wilfully determined on keeping to our ruined  habitation Tis a hard necessity I acknowledge to desert  this wasted fabric in which our honourable ancestors were  born and died but it no longer affords us maintenance be  coming our exalted rank and for the good of my descendants  I have resolved to establish myself up yonder and here she  looked towards the new banner where our consequence will  be properly kept up i Consequence maintenance cried  the other scornfully tossing her plumes let my family  perish rather than subsist on the vulgar mongrel texture of  that painted gewgaw Deserting this fabric of unmingled  silk pure even to its last attenuated thread shall we stoop to  provide support for our future progeny on a newfangled tissue  basely intermingled with cotton yarn I marvel at thy  degenerate vanity ennobled by my presence these ruins how  ever far decayed retain their pristine grandeur and so long  as one particle remains upon another here do I abide   And that will be sister returned the other until tomor  rows dawn when you and it together will be trampled into  dust But do as you like best and so farewell for ever  unless before too late thou seest thy folly So saying the  speaker flew up and settled upon the new standard  Next morning when the workmen returning to the chapel  proceeded to sweep away the trampled tatters of the old  Banner they dislodged its sole remaining occupant and  the proud and highborn Moth after a few irresolute flutters  joined her less pretending sister  The ruin of the new Banner forthwith commenced and so  it soon proved with the house of A Strengthened for  awhile by admixture of cotton yarn and reburnished by plebeian  gold that noble line soon began to exhibit symptoms of decay  for with it there still continued to exist the old consuming  principles pride of birth and pride of show which are repre  sented by the Moths of the Banners   A pond s a mirrored world where strong on weak  Cunning on simple prey   Where ignorance is bliss Tis folly to be wise is an Epi  curean maxim which on a superficial view may seem applicable  not only to a knowledge of events wherein its truth may in  some measure be allowed but also to a knowledge of things  wherein it must in all cases be strenuously denied It is  nevertheless certain that a knowledge of many little things  which in their aggregate and due improvement make up  wisdom though it usually augments may in some instances  tend to damp our pleasure even that quiet bliss so pure  and innocent derived from contemplation of the world of  nature It is doubtless at times more agreeable to glide  indolently over the surface of things in the shallow bark of  ignorance than to explore their depths in the divingbell of  research This is a reason amongst others why the pleasures  of childhood and sometimes those also of the superficial and  uneducated are so vivid and unalloyed but though to the  former we look back with a sigh and are now and then  tempted to regard the latter with a feeling almost akin to envy  few of us would purchase them at the price of a single pearl  of mental acquisition  As we have before observed nothing can have a greater  general tendency to augment our enjoyment of the country  than the study of Entomology yet one day as has happened  occasionally before our little learning on the subject of insects  served to cast a shade though it was but a passing one over  the cheerful feelings inspired by early spring We were out  in the morning while the dews yet hung heavy in the shade a  few remaining drops still brightly twinkling in the sun The  day was as fresh as the year and the face of nature as gay in  her renovated youth as if never embrowned by nigh six thousand  summer suns or pinched and wrinkled by as many winter frosts  Leaving the beaten footpath across the fields we pursued over  the grass a little private track of our own making towards an  old willow pollard which from long acquaintance and we be  lieve sole discovery and appropriation of certain of its venerable  charms we considered to the full as much our own property as  its legal owners To him it is nothing probably but a hollow  worthless stump to us it is a perfect treasurehouse more  full a thousand times in its mouldering decay than it was in  its solid strength The arm of lightning shivering picturesquely  its highest branch has struck it into coin for the painters  mint but it is the gentler hand of Time which has moulded  it for us into a casket and prepared it for the reception of  living treasures aurelia of Moth or grub of Beetle en  sconced beneath the case of rotten wood and bulging bark or  packed in its soft lining the vegetable mould which fills the  hollow of the trunk But though the season was favourable  we were not in search of insects in the shape of chrysalis or  any other Our trowel and collecting box were left at home  for we had come out solely for a walk and with intent to  enjoy ourselves as unreflectively as the giddiest flutterer of the  tribe just wakened into life It was not then our hobby  which carried us this time to the willow neither was it alto  gether habit but this our favourite tree having grown old  without having withal grown crabbed still offered to its  visitors besides a pleasant shade a comfortable seat formed  by one of the knobby excrescences which bulged from the  trunk at a convenient distance from the ground It presented  them besides in the clear dark pond it overshadowed with a  lookingglass that faithful mirror which from sapling youth  to stricken age had reflected its own form and over which  like an aged coquette it had hung closer and seemingly the  more enamoured as its years advanced Of the above accom  modations of those at least which afforded rest and shade we  were disposed that morning to avail ourselves and we sat  down not to reflect unless it were on the happiness around  us but simply to feel to give ourselves up as passive reci  pients to all the fresh and sweet peaceful and exhilarating  influences of the hour  Was there a single object within view or a single sound  within hearing that could possibly awaken one discordant  emotion The sheep in an adjoining field were bleating of peace  and goodfellowship the turtle was repeating her lay of love  and the shivering note of the little willow wren with a thou  sand others took up the tale Pleasure was on the wing in a  throng of insect forms and humming her delight in a chorus  of insect voices Hope was in the season happiness appa  rently in everything and yet as we sat and looked down  upon the smooth surface of the waters itself an image of  bright tranquillity thoughts of violence cruelty and de  struction took sudden and forcible possession of our mind  Such a confession unexplained might suffice to convict us  of something much amiss in that hidden receptacle the heart  something sadly at variance with all the smiling things around  That thus it has often been we may not alas deny but the  fault on the present occasion lay we verily believe less with  heart than head with that specific organ which led us first to  the pursuit of Entomology for it so happened that certain  grains of knowledge picked up therein had now insinuated  themselves between the hitherto smooth surface of our mind  and the shining face of outward nature hindering thus their  perfect union Our eyes as we have said were fixed upon  the water which to the cursory observer presented nothing  but a picture of still life of the old willow and the blue sky  To another examining more closely the mirrored landscape was  not without its moving objects and these whimsically displaced  as well as inverted a swallow appearing ever and anon to dip  its wing in the clouds or foliage while here and there a fish  seemed leaping from the sky An eye yet more attentive  might also have discerned that the surface of the water was  traversed by a multitude of queer dark little Insects with  straight lanky bodies and angular limbs gliding about in all  directions Skimming the glassy mirror like these but in  shape their very antipodes were certain other little active  bodies oval and convex as an egg bluishblack and polished  as a steel corslet now collected in groups appearing by twos  and threes to embrace each other then starting off singly as if  pricked by contact now motionless then whirling swiftly  round and round seeming absolutely tipsy with their native  element or giddy with the joy of existence Other creatures  of curious boatlike form almost thrice as big as the last were  cutting the water with their oars these also looked as if they  had drunk but three times deeper of an intoxicating draught  for oblivions apparently of the important distinction between  head and heels with the latter upwards and the former im  mersed they now hung as it were suspended in the water  then darted off with the celerity of a sixoared cutter All  these living objects as they met the eye were in perfect  harmony with the surrounding scene of peace What then  could we discern amiss in the pond and its joyous occupants  Actually we saw little more than what we have attempted to  describe but our smattering of knowledge concerning the  purposes and practices of Waterinsects served to throw a dark  shade of cruelty and violence on the one hand of suffering  and privation on the other over the moving picture of the pond  We knew that the Insect World of waters was emphatically  a world of destructiveness and that each of the above described  creatures wheeling about so merrily on the ponds surface  was in pursuit indeed of pleasure but of pleasure derived  chiefly from the chase of living prey or the cannibal delight  of devouring it Neither on the surface only but down to its  lowest depths the pond was teeming with a carnivorous multi  tude some for Insects of prodigious size and of uncouth  and frightful shapes others of almost invisible minuteness  but all alike busy and happy in cutting off the happiness of  their fellows Well there was nothing in this greatly dis  cordant with the general order of things natural and moral  but for this very reason the train of thinking it suggested  soon brought disturbance to that sensation of peacefulness  which all besides encouraged and we rose from our willow chair  almost wishing that we had known nothing of Entomology  Yet that was a foolish wish sprung of a foolish feeling  such as all feelings are which have the slightest tendency to  make us dissatisfied with the regulations of Divine Wisdom  however they may seem to jar upon what we are pleased to  consider our finer sensibilities It is certainly no pleasant  reflection that innumerable tribes of earth and sea and air  ourselves included live by the death of others the less  therefore we dwell upon it the better especially with any view  to explanation of a fact which stands in intimate connection  with the origin of evil that dark mystery which we are never  likely to penetrate except in the light of heaven When  however the subject of mutual destruction does by accident  come across our mind or our path a few reconciling thoughts  on it may be safely sought for and readily found  To apply them only to our proper subject the Insect Carni  von of the waters as Destroyers we may subdue our repug  nance to them by the thought that there is no guilt in their  destructiveness as Destroyed we may keep our pity for  them in wholesome check by believing that there is little  suffering in their destruction that with the tenants of our  little deep beneath the willow it may be as a pious and en  lightened writer has supposed it with the inhabitants of the  great deep of ocean Pain says our author speaking of  fishes has but little or brief residence among them for  even when absorbed by the larger ones for nutriment they are  swallowed without laceration and entombed in darkness and  death before they are well conscious of their change of situa  tion Death therefore is to them what the Druids in their  mythological theories sang it to be to man  A change which can hut for a moment last  A point between the future and the past  By the same writer it is added in a note that the Jewish  Rabbins estimated so highly the general comfort of fish exist  ence that one of them in describing their doctrine of the  transmigration of souls inculcates that those of the righteous  whose conversation is with the Lord and who only need a  purification go into fish This and other like wild imagina  tions may have originated partly in the desire to account for  and reconcile with our ideas of justice the suffering in any  sort of the harmless tribes in consequence of their furnishing  support to the carnivorous The deaths of the former by  violence instead of being viewed as a condition of their being  have been sometimes regarded in the light of punishment and  since such could not be inflicted justly on oteer than a respon  sible agent the forms of brutes have been assigned to human  spirits in a state of penalty or purgation Others have gone  further and adopted from the Jesuit Bather Bougeaut a  notion that all animals save the human are animated by evil  spirits or devils thus retained till the general judgment in  ignominious fleshy prisons and compelled meanwhile to be  conducive to mans use and pleasure This as they would  have it gives a satisfactory solution of the carnivorous pro  pensities of some the seemingly undeserved and needlessly  inflicted sufferings of others as well as of the evident proofs  of reasoning mind as distinguished from instinct observable  in every class of the brute creation from the halfreasoning  elephant to the sociallycommunicating ant In answer to  one of the objections against his theory that of the delight  taken by many persons of sense and religion in domestic beasts  and birds the Father adds What care we whether it be a  devil or any other creature that amuses us The thought of  it far from shocking pleases me mightily and I with grati  tude admire the goodness of the Creator who gave me so  many little imps to serve and entertain me Herein we  confess that we are no admirers of the worthy Jesuits taste  any more than a proselyte to his doctrine Its refutation may  be read in the loving eye of our faithful dog and heard in the  greeting chirp of our pet canary it is warbled by the nightin  gale cooed by the dove and hummed by the insect voices  which fill the summer air with life and gladness  To return now to our own Insect Devils of the pond  with whom having already shown up their evil propensities  there is no harm in making a little farther acquaintance  First for those black lanky looking creatures gliding about  the waters surface Of these our pond as most others  affords two varieties both of a spare and slender make but  one so delicately formed that even its body is scarcely thicker  than a line This line is broken however by two prominent  hemispheric eyes which though set really in the pigmys mons  trously long head appear to be in the middle of his slender  body He is usually wingless or with only short parallel  elytra This is the Hydrometa stay norum or Water Measurer  a common frequenter from March to August of every ditch as  well as pond where he glides about to murder the innocent  The fellowdestroyer by which this is usually accompanied  is a bird of the same dark feather only considerably more  bulky and furnished with closesetting wings He rows him  self merrily along by his hinder feet the sides of his body  being rendered impervious to water by a coat of silvery hairs  Somewhat resembling him in habits and in form though with a  body far less lean and long and with its darker hues enlivened  by red and white is another gliding or rowing destructive  completing the fatal three which insects themselves are  for ever cutting short the slender threads of insect life It was  not this morning visible on the willow pond and though we  have at times observed it on still waters it usually prefers to  buffet the running stream to glide not with but against the  current This is known to naturalists as the Velia rivulorum  A word now for that little whirling devil which albeit  black in hue is of less satanic seeming than the above for in  place of long rigid limbs and angular movements he displays  in liis circular gyrations and oval form something of beauty  in his polished corslet something of brightness and in his  social sportiveness something of good fellowship He and  his merry mates not the less destroyers are the little Whirl  wigs those bluishblack diamondlike Beetles which few can  have failed to notice whirling about on every pool Their  playful evolutions would seem however but a passetemps in  intervals of sterner business that of putting a full and fatal  stop to the sports of other waterrevellers weaker than them  selves  That topsyturvy imp of darkness which in proportion to  its superior magnitude creates yet greater ravages among his  fellows of the flood those before named included is the Water  Boatman t Swimming on his back legs upwards tail touching  the surface head inclined downwards he waits motionless on  the lookout for prey till on the least alarm he rows off with  infinite speed by help of the hairy fringe with which his hinder  feet are thickly bordered As well as with oars our boatman  is provided with wings useless in water but serving in case  of drought and failure in consequence of his native element  as a means of transport to some new scene of violence  But these which appear upon the surface are only a few  and not the most terrible amongst the devourers of pond and  streamlet for gliding through the depths below or lurking  crocodilelike within the mud or waterweeds a multitude of  fierce and frightful insects some in a state of maturity others  in progressive stages live solely by destruction One of these is  the Water Scorpion Stretching out its long lobsterlike fore  arms which are terminated each by a sharp claw serving the  purpose of a hand it seizes and holds fast its prey which it  then pierces with its sharp beak or proboscis a pointed hol  low weapon serving the further purpose of sucking the juices  of its struggling victim So thoroughly savage is the nature  of this creature that he would seem to destroy for destroying  sake and it is related by Kirby that one of them put into a  basin with several tadpoles killed all and ate none  The prevailing hue of this insect murderer is gloomy as his  trade his head shoulders limbs and wingcases being of a  blackishbrown hardly distinguishable from the mud in which  he loves to lurk but when his wings are expanded they dis  play also in unison with his occupation a bloodred body  terminated by a forked tail It is only in the gloom of evening  twilight that he creeps from his native element to hide within  the dark covert of the waterweeds or thence rising to cut  through the night air in search of some new abode Notwith  standing the capacity of its carnivorous maw this creature is  remarkable for the excessive flatness of its body  All the aquatic cannibals above named are insects in the  last or adult stage of their existence but the two very remark  able destroyers we shall now describe have yet to put oil other  and more perfect forms although their carnivorous capabilities  are fully developed A common inhabitant of ponds or of the  mud at their bottoms is an uglylooking animal with a light  brown wingless body and six legs having the air and movements  of a little reptile more than of an insect This creature has a  face or to speak more correctly a physiognomic appendage to  behold the like of which on a larger scale and mounted on the  shoulders of a man would suffice Medusalike to turn flesh  and blood to stone Emboldened however by his want of bulk  let us look at this monster in miniature as he works death for  his living at the bottom of a pond or if that be difficult at  the bottom of a basin furnished with pondwater mud and  proper prey It needs hardly however be observed that the  sight of killing in what form soever ought not to be pleasant  and is not profitable hardly to be sought for even for the  sake of the curious machinery and modus operandi of our  insect butcher At all events our younger readers would do  well to rest satisfied with the description of his murderous  mechanism and choose more agreeable subjects for their  practical observations Well his great projecting eyes always  on the watch for something eager to devour have elected a  chosen victim With catlike stealth he crawls towards it  Now he is close upon his prey and his next movement will  surely be to seize and grasp it with the foremost pair of his  hairy legs But what now Surely a mask is falling from  the caitiffs face Yes a veritable mask which has hidden  hitherto both from ns and from his victim the grimmest half  of his grim visage He has dropped his vizard but not  entirely for it still hangs pendent from his chin And now  do we see aright the mask as if touched by the wand of  Harlequin assumes another shape it has changed into a sort  of toothed and jointed trap which opens then closes on its  prey an unlucky tiny tadpole which is brought wriggling  into convenient reach of the jaws ready to receive him But  this traplike mask is so curious a machine and so dissimilar  to ought besides that we must borrow a description of it  more explanatory than our own   Conceive your under lip to be horny instead of fleshy  and to be elongated perpendicularly downwards so as to wrap  over your chin and extend to its bottom that this elongation  is there expanded into a triangular convex plate attached to it  by a joint so as to bend upwards again and fold over the face  as high as the nose concealing not only the chin and the  firstmentioned elongation but the mouth and part of the  cheeks conceive moreover that to the end of this lastmen  tioned plate are fixed two other convex ones so broad as to  cover the nose and temples that these can open at pleasure  transversely like a pair of jaws so as to expose the nose and  mouth and that their inner edges where they meet are cut into  numerous short teeth or spines or armed with one or more  sharp claws you will then have as accurate an idea as my  powers of description can give of the strange conformation of  the under lip in the larvae of these insects which conceals the  mouth and face precisely as I have supposed a similar con  struction of your lip would do yours When at rest this mask  applies close to and covers the face when they would make  use of it they unfold it like an arm catch the prey at which  they aim by means of the mandib aliform plates and then  partly refold it so as to hold the prey to the mouth in the  most convenient position for operation of the two pair of jaws  with which they are provided Reaumur proposes jokingly  the adoption by masqueraders of some such physiognomic  apparatus wherewith to astonish the Demoiselles andfwin  their admiring horror by putting it into devouring action at the  suppertable  Let us now leave our crawling masked assassin to wallow in  mud and murder at the bottom of his pond and delight our  eyes by looking at an insect of surpassing brilliancy and beauty  disporting on the wing above the water Its graceful shape  brilliant colours and glittering gauzy wings have won it  from the gallant Drench the appellation of Demoiselle Among  ourselves it is known better by the names of Horsestinger and  DragonDly The first is a misnomer because to horses it is  entirely harmless but amongst the insect crew it is a veritable  dragon to the full as fierce and cruel as our murderer in the  mask No wonder for it is his very self one at least of  his very kind He has laid aside his mask and therewith his  grub estate but retains as a perfected and brilliant Ply the  very same propensities as when an unsightly crawler propen  sities exercised now in the devouring of Butterflies in air  instead of Tadpoles in water  The archfiend with which we shall close our abridged list  of Water Devils is the British HydropTiilus the devil par ex  cellence of the solar microscope and of exhibitions a species  of WaterBeetle in its first or larva stage of being This  creature exceeds perhaps all its carnivorous fellows in size  measuring when at maturity an inch and a half in courage  as attacking even small fish and other animals larger than  itself in ferocity and in the possession of destructive weapons  powerful remarkably numerous and singularly adapted to  their designed purpose Broods of these murderers have  been passing the winter in embryo that is in the egg  enwrapped like innocents in silken coverlets or to speak more  correctly in silken balls suspended cradlelike to the stems of  submerged waterweeds These are now however detached  from their supports and may be seen floating on the surface of  stagnant pools exposed to the genial influence of the sun By  this if not already they will be soon awakened into life when  their first employment will be to gnaw a hole in their nests  whence they will descend to the bottom of the water each a  walking and swimming little animal with six legs a set of hairy  finlike appendages and a biforked tail But most conspi  cuous and notable of all its appurtenances are those which arm  the head the large strong jaws curved and pointed opening and  shutting like a pair of forceps with an apparatus of other instru  ments smaller and finer to assist in piercing tearing masti  cating and sucking the juices of its victims which comprise as  the infant destroyer advances to maturity almost every aquatic  insect within reach and in failure of these the brethren of one  common nest will turn their fangs upon each other On a fine  sunny day these insect sharks arise to the surface of the water  where they delight to bask If watched they remain motion  less with their jaws extended and if a stick be presented to  them they will seize it and will sometimes it is said permit  themselves to be cut to pieces rather than relinquish their hold  After the completion of its life as a larva the Hydrophilm  immures itself in a cell of its own formation near the waters  edge and after passing through the next stage of pupa or  chrysalis emerges a perfect Beetle In this form it is some  times found by day sitting on plants beside the water which  with the gloomy habits of its tribe it deserts for the air only  by night This creature of darkness and ferocity or one  closely allied to it is said when arrived at maturity to out  grow its carnivorous propensities and in lieu of animal and  living prey to content itself when a Beetle with the vegetable  growth of ponds and ditches t  For fuller description of this insect see Microscopic Cabinet Goring and  Pritchard  We have dwelt perhaps too long on the doings of these  Waterdevils and now dismiss them with the reconciling  thought that the world will forsake in maturity every savage  propensity natural and moral The prophecies of Holy Writ  give abundant assurance that when wars and vices depart  from among mankind the predatory system will also cease  within the animal kingdom The wolf shall dwell with the  lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid And  that this will be accomplished even to the letter we do not  the less believe because we cannot comprehend in what manner  Then may regenerate man be permitted to bring a new life of  peacefulness into the worlds within worlds of animated nature  Then may some drops of humanizing gentleness fall even into  that little world of waters over whose deeds of cruelty now  droops our favourite willow  BUTTERFLIES IN GENERAL   What more felicitie can fall to creature  Than to enjoy delight with libertie  And to be lord of all the workes of nature  To reigne in the aire from thearthe to highest skye  To feed on flowers and weedes of glorious feature  Wordsworth has apostrophized a Butterfly as Historian of  his infancy and thousands must have felt with the poet  that at sight of Butterflies the events of childhood have come  fresh to memory and they have seemed to look again upon  the pages of opening life those sunny pages which the blue  and crimson gold and silver of the Butterflys wing have  helped so often to illuminate In return for having thus  assisted to chronicle our own brightest days we are about to  give a sketch of Butterflies in general and of their prevailing  characteristics with notices of such incidents as happen nearly  alike to all We thought once indeed of selecting some  certain individual from this family of distinguished flutterers  with the view of making it the subject of a biographical notice  Bor instance t The Life Court and Times of a Purple Em  peror or The Memoirs and Correspondence of a Painted  Lady would have sounded well enough but where in the  life of a Butterfly should we have found the highly seasoned  requisites for pleasing public taste those buried and resus  citated scandals those unblushing falsehoods covered or dis  guised by rouge and rank which make up the greater portion  of royal and noble biography But setting these aside what  other materials it may be inquired could be supplied to the  manufacturer of Memoirs by the life of an idle Butterfly  Abundance we reply an ample sufficiency of mingled yarn  for the weaving of a tissue quite as durable to say nothing of  beauty as those which are spun daily out of lives as trifling  and much more uneventful Sunshine and shade love and  war accidents by flood and field hairbreadth escapes from  flying fireeyed dragons these and numberless vicissitudes  varied as their manycoloured pinions mark and to them  may seemingly extend to years the span of days or weeks  allotted to our glorious flutterers  Little perhaps did the author of our opening motto little  the poet who declares that   From flower to flower on balmy gales to fly  Is all they have to do beneath the radiant sky  seem to have thought upon the manifold changes and chances  of papilionaceous life Why then did we not edit the Life of  a Butterfly Bor the simple reason that being more scrupu  lous than some of our editorial contemporaries we did not  like to represent as individual experiences incidents which  might and daily do occur to Butterflies in general but which  we could not vouch for as having actually happened to the  subject of our Memoir Therefore until we are enabled by  help of wings to attend the Purple Emperor in his progresses  through air and are sufficiently versed in the antennal language  as carried on by touch and signal to become a spy upon the  Painted Lady in her hours of supposed privacy and until from  our knowledge of her mode of writing as inscribed on leaves  we are enabled to fathom the secrets of her correspondence  until then we must suspend the contemplated work to which  at present we confess ourselves incompetent  We shall be content in the meanwhile to give the history  of Butterflies in general as it has been noted down and re  corded not in one but in numerous individuals of the race  Let it not however be imagined that the history of all will  serve for that of one or that of one for all There are among  them according to their various tribes and families grand  distinctions not only of dress but of manners also besides  which every individual has we doubt not a character of its  own  Thoughts on Butterflies always bring with them thoughts  on flowers We have viewed them already in some of their  mutual relations but under this their combined aspect they  are both so doubly pleasant to look upon that we must trace  here a few of their corresponding features some of them  perhaps for a second time Flowers seem as it were to  impart a portion of their own characteristics to all things that  frequent them This is peculiarly exemplified in the Butterfly  which must be regarded par excellence as the Insect of  Flowers and a Flowerlike Insect gay and innocent made  after a floral pattern and coloured after floral hues But even  with the insect families which are usually dark and repulsive  that for instance of Cockroaches which are for the most part  black or brown the few species which resort to flowers are  gaily coloured What a contrast also between the dark loath  some indoor Spider and their prettily painted green and red  and white and yellow brethren of the field and garden which  seek their prey among the flowers while more striking still is  the difference between the wingless disgusting plague of cities  and the elegantly formed brightly coloured winged Bugs  which are common frequenters of the parterre Whether this  be imputed to the effect of light or assigned poetically to  the breathing influence of a flowery atmosphere and the ten  dency of all things to produce their similitudes there lies  beneath the natural fact a moral analogy of application to  ourselves  Let us quote to this effect from the Herbal of a quaint old  writer on the influence of flowers Through their beauty and  variety of colour and exquisite forme they do bring to a liberal  and gentle minde the remembrance of honestie comelinesse  and all kinds of virtues for it would be an unseemly thing  as a certain wise man saith for him that doth look upon and  handle faire and beautiful things and who frequenteth and is  conversant in faire and beautiful places to have his mind not  faire alsoe  However few may thus read their moral and open their  hearts for the reception of its sweetness we might almost say  that all but life haters love flowers and for the same reasons  nearly all though haters of Insects in general love Butterflies  We almost indeed seem to look upon them as animated  members of the floral kingdom and regard them much in like  manner according to the progressive stages of our lives In  childhood we long for and pursue them in youth we poetize  them in manhood scarcely heed them in age begin to  find in them perhaps alas for the first time sermons of  warning or emblems of hope The following with other  beautiful lines from an American poet were written upon  Flowers but with the substitution of only a single word do  they not apply precisely unto Butterflies which like them are  wont to   expand their light and soullike wings  Teaching us by most persuasive reasons  How akin they are to human things  And with childlike credulous affection  We behold those tender wings expand  Emblems of our own great resurrection  Emblems of the bright and better land  See Frontispiece  But it is not a mere poetic much less a fanciful analogy  which links the Butterfly by a thousand golden chains with  the loveliest productions of the vegetable world The leaf  and the Caterpillar the flower and the Butterfly seem as it  has been said made for each other though we must certainly  admit that the plant would to all appearance do much better  without the insect than the insect without the plant which  furnishes the Caterpillar with sustenance and the Butterfly  with a velvet cushion for repose or a nectared cup for  refreshment  Independently of this bond of use more mutual perhaps  than we are at present able to discern there has been traced  by naturalists an intimate analogy of states and developments  between the Lepidopterous Insect and the perfect vegetable  The Caterpillar disclosed from the egg encases in its various  skins the gradually expanding form of the future Butterfly  as the plant burst from the seed or bulb encloses in its  successive integuments of root stalk and floral leaves the  flower and fruit in process of formation The chrysalis that  shroud or cover which at once protects and imprisons the  winged creature it encloses finds its correspondence in the  defensive calyx which enwraps the delicate corolla Both burst  from their envelopes in perfect form the Insect to die  the flower to fade soon after having provided for the con  tinuance of their kind  In the habits no less than in the structure of the Butterfly  and the flower there is observable no slight degree of corres  pondence In the gloom of night or of cloudy weather the  Insect folds its wings the flower its winglike petals and as  flowers love and turn towards the sun so Butterflies open  their pinions to receive his welcome rays sometimes alter  nately closing them in fanlike motion to temper probably  his too ardent beams Sometimes with the devoted worship  of the sunflower a Butterfly will follow the God of Day in  his ascension and decline Our Purple Emperor mounts from  his leafy throne the top of an oak or elm tree to a height  invisible and highest under a noonday sun then redescending  lowers his flight with the setting luminary  As the blowing of flowers can be forced or retarded by  artificial heat or cold so it has been found with the emerge  ment of Butterflies Eeaumur made many successful experi  ments by aid of hothouses and hens upon various chrysalides  from which he caused the premature evolvement of the perfect  insect and proposed by employment of the same means on an  extensive scale to cause summer flowers and summer flutterers  to appear together in the midst of winter  Darwin had a pretty fancy that Butterflies usually resemble  in colour the flowers they are most accustomed to frequent  The poetnaturalist carried this notion doubtless beyond nature  but the idea is one which seems to shoot less wide of its mark  than many aimed from the Litchfield longbow There is a  very large proportion of white and yellow flowers which we  see visited perhaps most frequently by an equally large  proportion of white and yellowish Butterflies owing probably  to the preponderance of each The greater number of blue  Butterflies are certainly however accustomed to frequent the  blue flowers most abounding in chalky soils and the rich  tone of colouring in our autumn flowers harmonizes well with  that of autumn Butterflies But whether they be or be not  dyed usually after the colours of their favorite blossoms it  seems agreed on all hands that the Butterfly form and its  fluttering habiliments are always fashioned after the floral  pattern as it prevails in the papilionaceous families of the  vegetable world  We might continue at greater length our remarks on Butter  flies as connected with flowers which make verily part and  parcel of their existence but space forbids us and now re  turning to their relations of use we must notice somewhat  more minutely than most people perhaps are in the habit of  doing the manner in which the delicate delights of rest and  refreshment provided for them by the flower are turned to  account by these luxurious insects Let us follow one to the  garden   Where he arriving round about doth die  From bed to bed from one to tother border  And takes survey with curious busy eye  Of every flower and herbe there set in order  Now this now that he tasteth tenderly  Yet none of these he rudely doth disorder  Ne with his feete their silken leaves deface  But pastures on the pleasures of each place  Behold him seated on his velvet cushion the corolla of an  aster or a single dahlia in its centre his table of regalement  on which a whole service of golden vases are set before him in  due order His long spiral tongue has hitherto lain coiled  betwixt two side appendages but now unrolling he plunges  it to the bottom of a chosen chalice then partially recurves  and indraws his honied draught through the tubelike sucker  Again and again he quaffs like an Alderman as he is  We know him by his bulk and the richness of his furred and  velvet robes scarlet and black relieved with white But see  how the rights and pleasures even of an Alderman Butterfly  are open to invasion Look at that impertinent prying   Argus t tired of his rustic fare in heath or meadow and  hovering overhead allured seemingly by sight or scent of  richer dainties wherein art has had a finger Down he lights   Vanessa Atalanta Alderman or Red Admiral Butterfly  t Polyommatus Argus P Alexis Common Blue Butterfly  A BUTTERFLY DUEL  311  and seats himself beside the dahlia table an unbidden guest  The Aldermans translucent eye from red grows redder and  his gorgeous robes shake with indignation as he sees the  bold intruder unroll his liquorish tongue and dip it into one  of his own appropriated cups Still however he restrains  his ire within the bounds of Aldermanic dignity or prudence  he attempts not to drive the invader from his invaded board  But can it be possible the little Argus not content with a  dinner upon sufferance has actually become the assailant of  his unwilling host He closes his blue wings opening in  the act a hundred eyes and then tries with his pigmy body  to dislodge by shoving the corporation of the Alderman  But the patience of the latter and his prudence are now  put to flight Both start from table mutually buffet and  ascend in air mounting higher and higher as their choler  rises each growing hotter and hotter in his progress towards  the midday sun Now blue now red is uppermost Now  the light weight and azure pinions of the little Argus now  the heavy body and flapping wings of the burly Alderman  Which will be the gainer of the day Bor once Might and  Right are both upon a side and for that reason doubtless  Might seems worsted The combatants have risen so high  that they are almost beyond our dazzled sight but  now behold descending and alone the little blue aggressor  He has driven his opponent from the aerial field as well as from  his honied fare which he now returns to appropriate and discuss  at leisure as he resumes his seat upon the dahlias vacant  velvet The bold urchin has however paid forfeit for his  rudeness and pugnacity When he first alighted down beside  the Alderman he was a Beau Butterfly of the first water  but now his blue bravery late so bright and glossy all worn  and torn and jagged he looks what he is an impertinent  pilfering quarrelsome little varlet  Besides the above the Blue Argus Mr Knapp in his  Journal of a Naturalist notices as contentious animals  the common White Butterfly of our gardens and the small  Copperf as quarrelsome as he is handsome often fighting  even with his kindred when he meets a fellow on a September  knot of Chinaasters It has been noticed by the same  observer that clouds seem to abate the ardour of contending  Butterflies and that not unfrequently when two are engaged  on high in ardent and unheeding strife the arrival of a third  party in the shape of a hungry bird at once settles the differ  ence of the pugnacious pair by their conversion into a flying  meal But the most knowing among naturalists as well as  those of other professions are for ever differing and these  Butterfly struggles viewed by the writer last mentioned in the  light of combats have been regarded by another J in the more  pleasant one of pastime considered merely as frolicsome  exuberances of the vital principle played on by the buoyant  air expanded by the sunshine in their wings and bodies  Neither are their buffetings considered by Mr Bennie so  rude by half as they appear and he urges against the  probability of their angry purpose the number of the insects  sometimes as many as five or six seen together in collision  Of this argument however we scarcely see the force unless  it could be proved that Butterflies being wiser than men  never took sides or part in each others quarrels But as no  mortal consequences have ever as we know of been seen to  result from these rencounters in the air we must perhaps leave  unanswered the question of their dubious meaning that of  rough play or gentle warfare till the progress of phrenology  enables us to pronounce safely on the amount of combativeness  in a Butterflys skull Meanwhile we would much rather  incline to the pacific notion and in poetic justice admit our  favourite until we know to the contrary to be   A beautiful creature  That is gentle by nature  even though by so doing we throw a double stigma for his  pursuit and devourment upon our favourite robin  Butterflies are said to be the thirstiest creatures save Ants  and Crickets of all the Insect community but however they  may get tipsy perhaps quarrelsome over their cups of honied  wine it would appear that they are the best friends possible  when as is no uncommon occurrence they meet together in  numerous water drinking assemblies Like a row of white  muslin Misses at a Temperance TeaMeeting the small white  Butterflies are often in hot weather to be seen sitting side by  side on the margin of a halfdry pond where   in the same bathing their tender feet e  they are enabled at once to quench their thirst for water and  very likely for gossip In their choice of the former they  are however by no means so refined as the elegance of their  appearance would lead one to imagine for in like manner  as we have known delicate young ladies as great lovers of  London Porter as of sparkling Champagne or of the crystal  spring so the stagnant muddy pool or the dusty sprinkling of  a metropolitan road would seem to all appearance as grateful  to the Butterfly palate as the translucent rivulet or cooling  fountain  In these social assemblages but few females are accustomed  to be present though no law of absolute exclusion would seem  to exist against them as in the aerial dances of the Gnat The  prevailing absence of lady Butterflies from these waterdrinking  reunions has been assigned rather to their habits which being  of a most laudable stayathome character do not lead them  to those flights in the burning sun which excite the thirst of  their roving partners We should be the more unjust in  passing over without due praise this quiet domesticity of the  female Butterfly because it would never seem with her as with  some of her Moth cousins a mere virtue of necessity The  latter possess in some cases only apologies for wings or such  as are adequate only to the very brief support of their heavy  bodies whereas the Butterfly maid or matron is furnished  with a pair to the full as ample as those of her suitor or her  mate  Not always satisfied with their transits from field to field  and flower to flower certain families of the Butterfly race seem  seized occasionally with a perfect mania for visiting countries  beyond the sea but whether among the immense assemblages  which collect for this purpose females are included would  seem a doubtful point By staying as usual at home they  would at all events be no losers on such occasions the greater  number of winged adventurers being supposed to perish in  their passage across the ocean  Many Butterflies have a wide geographical range and one  of them the Painted Lady is remarkable for being a denizen  of each quarter of the globe With us this elegant insect  is in some seasons plentiful in others rare Its spiny cater  pillar is a feeder on spiny leaves those chiefly of the great  spearthistle Thistles by the way even wayside thistles  acquire in our sight a thousand piquant charms as soon as  we begin to notice insects We have just seen in its leaves  the nursery of the Painted Lady one of our prettiest Butterflies  and they afford the same to one of our prettiest Beetles the  little green Tortoise Its honeyscented flower is a loadstar of  attraction to a humming host of Hymenoptera while to some  of them most often to the redhipped Humblebee it affords   also a purple couch whereupon at drowsy evening as in the  fading time of year we are sure almost to catch him napping  When the purple of the flowers has faded also the head of a  thistle remains still a tower of strength for defence not alone  of vegetable life sometimes its bristling outworks may pro  tect only its own seeds but most often they enclose also an  insect garrison to which this bitter corn supplies provisions  Minute grubs and tiny caterpillars bright scarlet and brownish  white thus live by thousands within the prickly calyx till in  lieu of the seed and its feathery down devoured and arrested  they themselves are seen floating through the air in the winged  forms of downy Moth or glittering My  Eor the most part the wings of both sexes among Butterflies  are adorned alike but sometimes as with the feathered race  there is a difference clearly not to the ladys advantage in the  painting of her pigmy plumes The pretty OrangeTip that  wellknown sporter amidst sylvan glades and meadows has at  home occasionally beside him a whitewinged partner bearing  his name but without a colour of pretension to the title The  brilliant blue of our little Argus of fighting celebrity is deepened  in his lady to a purplish brown while the bright yellow of the  Brimstone beaut fades in his modest belle to a greenish white  Linnaeus not aware it is supposed of this occasional difference  of colour in the opposite sexes of Butterflies has sometimes  strangely put asunder what nature joins together representing  perhaps the husband as a Trojan and making his wife figure  in the ranks of the opposing Grecians or vice versa  To talk of Greeks and Trojans in connection with Butterflies  may require a word of explanation to the uninitiated To such  then be it known that for the convenience of arrangement the  great Swedish naturalist founded on fabulous and ancient  history an allegorical system wherein Butterflies divided into  sections of Greeks and Trojans were named after their deities  princes heroes nymphs and plebeians an ingenious and  useful plan but sometimes involving a curious contradiction  and unfitness of terms It would seem notwithstanding  that the imaginative inventor of this system sought for and  in many instances found a sort of emblematic personal analogy  between his Butterfly and its classic namesake The beautiful  Papilio Ulpssis bears for instance on its wings a radiating  cerulean disk which being surrounded on every side by a  margin of intense black gives the idea of light shining in  darkness and this is supposed not improbably to have  suggested to Linnseus the insects fitness to symbolize the wisest  of the Greeks in an age of barbarism The Papilio Priamus  in all its regal yet subdued splendor of purple black and  green is no unsuited representative of the unhappy Trojan  king or the yet more glorious Papilio Menelaus in his azure  robes of the magnificent husband of the beauteous Helen  while the bloodred Nero may be allowed to symbolize the  sanguinary Boman Emperor Perhaps in the whole range of nature there is no object of  equal size which presents so much combined splendour variety  and elegance as a Butterflys wing   Where colours blend in ever varying dye  And wanton in their gay exchanges vie  Its richness of hue and velvety softness of texture are produced  by the seeming powder in reality minute feathers or scales  sometimes intermixed with hairs by which it is thickly over  laid in the manner of a roof with tiles The number of these  little plumes is immense yet hardly so prodigious as the  patience of certain Entomologists who having counted found  them on the wing of a Silk worm Moth to amount to 400000  while as many as 100735 were found comprised within a  single square inch of that of a Peacock Butterfly When  stripped of its plumage the wing as all must have noticed is  left a thin transparent membrane intersected by nervures and  dotted with little holes wherein the plumelets were inserted  In a few instances chiefly in tropical insects spots are left by  nature perfectly transparent contrasting prettily with the rich  velvet which surrounds them  Several tribes of our native Butterflies are distinguished and  classed according to their prevailing colours Our fulgid  Coppers and Eritillaries f with silverspotted wings look  allied by their metallic lustre with the metallic productions of  earth Our Blues J imitate the azure tints of the sky while  others which display shades of light progressively warming  from white to orange have been considered not unaptly as   sacred to the day Those concentric circles of colour called  ocelli or eyes which give in some instances such an accession  of life and brilliancy to the wings of Butterflies and Moths  may be looked on as stars of distinction belonging to their  order Lepidoptera conferred solely on one other of the insect  race and eclipsed only by the magnitude and profusion of  those which are lavished on the strutting peacock  There are few people perhaps unwilling to bestow their  meed of praise on the beautiful object we have just described  however they may be usually accustomed to defraud nature of  her just tribute of notice and admiration but how often has the  Butterflys wing like other exquisite works of Creation drawn  from the beholders lips expressions ascending from the in  different Very pretty to the enraptured How superlatively  beautiful without giving rise to one thought about the  taste and skill of its Divine Artificer or one feeling about that  bounty and benevolence which has led him to bestow all this  elaborate ornament on a little creature designed as we cannot  doubt to minister to the delight of our admiring eyes to  give for us a living charm to the flowers he emulates and  in his emblematic story no less than in his exhilarating flights  towards the source of day to raise our spirits above and  beyond it to the source of all things bright and beautiful  These we are persuaded are the primary objects of their Great  Creator in filling the air with forms of life and grace which  destitute of outward beauty might have accomplished as well  all the other ends of their creation Let not therefore our own  heedlessness and ingratitude frustrate a design so gracious  Would we know some other obvious and essential uses of  the Butterfly race let us inquire of the thrush the robin and  the wren in whose billoffare they hold a most conspicuous  place and remember how these papilionaceous epicures con  tribute to our pleasure and service filling the woods and  gardens with most sweet music and at the same time  ridding them of a multitude of other insects whose mischiefs  we are less inclined to overlook than those wrought in its  infancy by the admired Butterfly
