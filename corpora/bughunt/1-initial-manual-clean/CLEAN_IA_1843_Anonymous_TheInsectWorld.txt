THE 


INSECT WORLD; 

OR, 

A BRIEF OUTLINE 


OF 

THE CLASSIFICATION, STRUCTURE, 
AND ECONOMY OF INSECTS. 


“ The wisdom of the Workman is commonly perceived in that 


which is of little size.” 















The design of this little volume is to induce 
those young persons who deem the Insect In-
habitants of the earth fit rather for “ cleanly 



riddance,” than for curious regard, more atten¬ 
tively to observe the exquisite structure and 
astonishing instincts which they display. A 
close examination of the wonders revealed in 
the Insect World cannot fail to produce the 
conviction, that the power, the wisdom, and the 
superintending providence of God, are as truly 
manifested in the meanest fly that sports upon 
the gale, as in the magnificent forms and high 
endowments of the most exalted of created beings.

FIRST EVENING. 

Folly of prejudice against insects—Their various claims 
on our notice—Estimated number of distinct species— 
Probability that their metamorphoses suggested many 
of the fables of the Poets, and the doctrine of a 
metempsychosis—The Butterfly’s Birth-day. 

Olil there is an earwig! said Emma B. jump¬ 
ing from her seat. Disagreeable things, how I 
hate them! I wish I could destroy them all. 

And every insect in existence;—you had better 
clear the earth of them all at once, said her 
brother Frederick, laughing. 

Emma. 

Well, Frederick; it would be a good thing, I 
think, if I could. Insects are odious creatures ; 
I cannot bear them. 

Frederick. 

You would soon have cause to wish for them 




back again, I fancy; not even excepting the 
“disagreeable earwigs.” For my part I consider 
them a most useful and ornamental part of 
creation : to say the truth, I am very fond of them. 

Emma. 

Fond of insects! Frederick ; I am sure nobody 
in their senses can ever be fond of such disagree¬ 
able things. 

Frederick. 

You put me in mind, Emma, of a law-case I 
was reading lately, which occurred nearly two 
hundred years ago, when people generally were 
about as wise on this subject as you are now. 
It was an attempt to set aside a lady’s will on 
the ground of lunacy, of wdiich the only symptom 
alleged was her taste for collecting butterflies. 
You would have pronounced a verdict against 
her without hesitation, I suppose. And yet I 
have often heard you admire the collection in 
the Study. 

Emma. 

O those are dead and cannot annoy any one; 
besides they are so pretty; they are very different 
from the odious things that are always buzzing 
and crawling about. 





Mr. B. 

What is that I just now heard about odious 
things that are always buzzing and crawling about? 
Who is speaking of my little favourites in that 
manner ? 

Emma. 

Papa! y our favourites! you are joking now. 

Mr. B. 

No indeed, Emma, I am not. And if instead of 
indulging in the silly prejudices against insects, 
so common to young ladies, you would examine 
their history a little, I think they would soon 
become your favourites too. 

You are fond of botanv; I have often been 
pleased to observe your skill and diligence in 
collecting and drying specimens, and I think 
your hortus siccus does you great credit; but the 
botanist, Emma, who is not also an entomologist, 
is like a traveller who should content himself 
with describing countries, without taking any 
notice of their inhabitants. 

Entomology has indeed attractions which 
botany cannot boast. A new plant is seldom 
to be met with, even by those who have 
opportunities for the most extensive researches; 





but the study of insects presents an inexhaustible 
fund of new and pleasing entertainment: every 
pool, every stone, every tree or plant, affords fresh 
subjects for curious examination; and how often 
soever our researches may be made, we shall never 
have exhausted this source of interesting amuse¬ 
ment.—But here comes Mamma. 

I am reasoning with your daughter, my dear, 
on the dislike to insects, which I am surprised to 
find her entertaining; I should certainly have 
given her credit for more taste and good sense. 

Mrs. B. 

I have often regretted the foolish prejudice 
which Emma has unhappily imbibed against this 
beautiful and elegant part of creation. She has 
learned it, I suspect, from some of her young com¬ 
panions at school. It is a great pity that girls 
who display good sense on other subjects, and even 
some sensible women too, should exhibit on this 
such unaccountable weakness. 

I well remember once sitting in company with 
a party of very intelligent women, when an unfor¬ 
tunate spider made its appearance on the hearth¬ 
rug. The sudden entrance of a tig er could scarce¬ 
ly have occasioned more consternation. “ Oh! 





there is a spider! ” one of them exclaimed; 
and in a moment they all jumped up on their 
chairs for safety, while I was left to encounter the 
terrific intruder alone. 

Frederick. 

I wish I had been there. How I should 
have laughed to see them! 

Mrs. B. 

Prejudice originates in ignorance: and perhaps 
the best method of correcting these prejudices in 
Emma, if you could spare the time for it, would be 
to give her some instruction on the subject. 
Could you now and then afford us an evening for 



the purpose? 

Mr. B. 

I would willingly make any effort to correct in 
mv dear girl a foible of so injurious a tendency, 
and shall be most happy to attend to your sugges¬ 
tion whenever I can find a leisure hour. She is 
interested in botany; but, as I have just been 
telling her, without an acquaintance also with 
those little inhabitants that confer animation on 
every tree, and shrub, and flower, I might add on 
eveiy stream, and every stone, she will enjoy but 

half the gratification it might afford her. 




6


I ask, for my part, no clearer proof of the exist¬ 
ence of an infinitely wise, skilful, and beneficent 
Creator than that which may be derived from the 
study of insects. As St. Basil beautifully says, 
tc If you speak of a fly, a gnat, or a bee, your 
conversation will be a sort of demonstration of his 
power whose hand formed them.” 

They present too a most striking and delightful 
proof of the minuteness of God’s providential care ; 
for we find that the structure, the food, the habita¬ 
tions, even of those of whose existence w r e were 
ignorant till the microscope discovered them, are 
regulated and provided in a manner as complete 
as those of the largest and apparently most favour¬ 
ed creatures. Surely we may infer from this, 
that nothing in which we are interested is too 
small to be regarded by his eye, and accom¬ 
plished by his love. 

Mrs. B. 

The smallest insects are as exactly finished as 
the most graceful beasts, or the birds of the 
brightest plumage, and often even more gaily 
ornamented. 

Mr. B. 

Your favourite writer, Mr. Kirby, I think says. 




“ These little creatures appear to have been 
Nature's favourite productions, in which, to mani¬ 
fest her power and skill, she has combined and con¬ 
centrated almost all that is either beautiful and 
graceful, interesting and alluring, or curious and 
singular in every other class and order of her 
children. To these, her valued miniatures, she 
has given the most delicate touch and highest 
finish of her pencil. Numbers she has armed 
with glittering mail, which reflects a lustre like 
that of burnished metals; in others she lights up 
the radiance of polished gems. Some she has 
decked with what looks like liquid drops or plates 
of gold and silver; or with scales or pile which 
mimic the colour and emit the rays of the same 
precious metals. To some she has given fins like 
those of a fish, or a beak resembling that of birds; 
to others, horns, nearly the counterparts of those 
of various quadrupeds. The bull, the stag, and 
even the vainly-sought-for unicorn, have, in this 
respect, many representatives among insects. 
One is armed with tusks, not unlike those of 
an elephant; another is bristled with spines, as 
the porcupine and hedgehog with quills; another 
has the disproportionate legs of the kangaroo; 
and a fourth the threatening head of a snake. 





The amazing variety both of ornament and 
form observable in the insect world is indeed 
an endless subject of interesting remark. And 
when we consider that in the structure, even of 
the smallest of them, there are many more com¬ 
ponent parts than in the enormous living masses 
of the elephant or the whale, and observe also 
the agility of their movements, their stratagems, 
their address, their skill, and their industry, we 
are lost in astonishment at the infinite wisdom 
and skill of their almighty Maker. 

Emma. 

I had no idea, Papa, that any thing so interest¬ 
ing could be said of insects. I begin to think 
I should like to know more about them. 

Mr. B. 

In introducing you to an acquaintance with 
insects, my love, I shall introduce you to an 
acquaintance with the first geometricians, the 
first architects, the first miners, the first weavers, 
the first employers of diving-bells and air-pumps, 
the first paper-makers; indeed, with the first 
practisers of various arts on the invention of 
which man vainly prides himself. 





It is not perhaps too much to say, that many 
of these tiny operatives, the bee and the ant for 
example, make a much nearer approach to the 
intellectual superiority of man than any others 
of the animal creation. 

It may also be safely asserted, that the influence 
of insects in the economy of nature is greater than 
that of any other of the inferior classes. They 
hold a kind of universal empire over the earth 
and its inhabitants; an empire to which even 
the proudest monarchs have been forced to bow. 
Often have their desolating hosts laid waste 
extensive -provinces, bringing in their train pesti¬ 
lence and famine. “ Before them,” as the 
prophet Joel speaks, “has been the garden of 
Eden; and behind them, a desolate wilderness.” 

But though sometimes the ministers of God’s 
displeasure, their more usual office is that of 
agents of his mercy. Unceasingly diligent in the 
province assigned them, they preserve the earth, 
the water, and the air, in a state of sufficient 
purity for the habitation and the use of man; and 
hence have been very properly termed, “ The 
great scavengers of nature . 99 




Frederick. 

Do you know, father, what is the number of 
distinct species of insects ? 

Mr. B. 

The number of distinct species already known 
and described cannot be estimated at less than 
twenty thousand; and there can be no doubt 
that numbers have escaped observation, and 
have never yet been described. This is perhaps 
the case even with British insects; with respect 
to exotics, we may well believe that our catalogues 
are far from being complete. Beauty of colour, 
or singularity of form, has generally directed 
the choice of travellers in making their collections; 
to the neglect of multitudes whose humbler guise 
or more retiring habits have concealed them from 
observation. 

Frederick. 

The insects of different countries vary very 
much, do they not? 

Mr. B. 

Yes: the different species of insects, like those 
of vegetables, are circumscribed within geogra¬ 
phical limits. Those of the East Indies, generally 
speaking, differ essentially from those of the West 


 


Indies, and the insects of Africa from both of 
these; the insects of temperate regions differ 
again from those of the torrid zone; and each 
region of the temperate zone has its own peculiar 
insects, which are rarely found elsewhere. 

The intertropieal countries, covered with 
immense forests, the trees of which are watered 
by a superabundant dew, are by far the most 
rich in these brilliant ornaments of nature : Brazil 
and Guiana are especially distinguished by the 
number and beauty of their insect inhabitants, 
and in this respect may perhaps be said to excel 
all other parts of the world. Many of the most 
beautiful specimens in my cabinet are from thence. 

Mrs. B. 

The metamorphoses of insects are to me among 
the most wonderful occurrences of creation. 

Mr. B. 

They are truly astonishing. That the animal, 
which, a few months ago was a wormlike cater¬ 
pillar, slowly crawling on the plant whence it 
derived its nourishment, should be now furnished 
with embroidered wings, 

“Through fields of air prepared to sail, ,r 
is so wonderful a fact, that were it not for its 





continual recurrence, and the minuteness of the 
objects in which it takes place, it would be viewed 
by all with eager curiosity and astonishment. 

Some have conjectured, and I think with a 
great appearance of probability, that the first 
idea of the marvellous metamorphoses which the 
poets recount, originated in an observation of the 
wonderful changes effected in the insect world; 
and that the doctrine of the metempsychosis, or 
transmigration of souls from one body to another, 
took its rise also from the same source. 

[ am the more disposed to think this conjecture 
right, from a quotation I have met with from 
the Institutes of Menu, which are held in high 
veneration by the Hindoos. 

In these Institutes it is declared, that “ A priest 
who hath drunk wine, shall migrate into a moth 
or fly, feeding on ordure. He who stealeth the 
gold of a priest, shall pass a thousand times 
into the bodies of spiders. If a man shall steal 
honey, he shall be born a great stinging gnat; 
if oil, an oil-drinking beetle; if salt, a cicada; 
if a househould utensil, an ichneumon fly.” 

Mrs. B. 

Thus the ignorant heathen, wandering among 





the wilds of an exuberant imagination, with no 
better light than that of human reason to guide 



them, misinterpret the wonders of nature; and 
deduce, from the most striking proofs of divine 
power and goodness, theories dishonourable to 
God, and degrading to man. 

Mr. B. 

And deduce them too from those very facts 
which, when viewed in the light of divine revela¬ 
tion, most pleasingly suggest to the Christian's 
mind the thought of that last, grand hope to 
which the gospel points. 

Frederick. 

You mean the Resurrection. 

Mr. B. 

Yes : I never witness these changes without 
being powerfully reminded of that glorious day 
when this mortal shall put on immortality; and 
feeling disposed to ask with the Apostle, Why 
should it be thought a thing incredible that God 
should raise the dead ?—that that divine energv, 
which thus continually revivifies nature, and repro¬ 
duces beings, after a period of death-like repose, in 

forms so totallv different from those under which 



they had previously existed, should also change 





these vile bodies, and raising them to a new life, 
should adorn them with a beauty and glory, and 
endow them with capacities and faculties of which, 
in our present state, we can form no conception. 

Mrs. B. 

You just now quoted a line from my favourite 
little piece, The Butterfly’s Birth-day. The poem 
would please the young folks ; perhaps you will 
favour us by reciting it. 

Mr. B. 

With pleasure. 

The shades of night were scarcely fled ; 

The air was mild, the winds were still; 

And slow the slanting sunbeams spread 
O’er wood and lawn, o’er heath and hill: 

From fleecy clouds of pearly hue 
Had dropt a short but balmy shower, 

That hung like gems of morning dew 
On every tree and every flower : 

And from the blackbird’s mellow throat 
Was pour’d so loud and long a swell, 

As echoed with responsive note 
From mountain side and shadowy dell: 

When, bursting forth to life and light, 

The offspring of enraptured May, 

The Butterfly, on pinions bright, 

Launch’d in full splendour on the day. 


 


Unconscious of a mother’s care, 

No infant wretchedness she knew ; 

But as she felt the vernal air, 

At once to full perfection grew. 

Her slender form, ethereal light, 

Her velvet-textured wings enfold ; 

With all the rainbow’s colours bright, 
And droptwith spots of burnish’d gold. 

Trembling with joy a while she stood, 
And felt the sun’s enlivening ray; 

Drank from the skies the vital flood, 
And wonder’d at her plumage gay ! 

And balanc’d oft her broider’d wings, 
Through fields of air prepared to sail; 
Then on her vent’rous journey springs, 
And floats along the rising gale. 

Go, child of pleasure, range the fields, 
Taste all the joys that spring can give, 
Partake what bounteous summer yields, 
And live whilst yet ’tis thine to live. 

Go, sip the rose’s fragrant dew, 

The lily’s honey’d cup explore; 

From flower to flower the search renew, 
And rifle all the woodbine’s store ; 

And let me trace thy vagrant flight, 

Thy moments too of short repose, 

And mark thee then with fresh delight, 
Thy golden pinions ope and close. 





But,hark! whilst thus I musing stand, 
Pours on the gale an airy note; 

And, breathing from a viewless band, 

Soft silv’ry tones around me float! 

They cease—but still a voice I hear, 

A whisper'd voice of hope and joy, 

“ Thy hour of rest’s approaching near,— 
Prepare thee, mortal! thou must die ! 

“ Yet, start not!—on thy closing eyes 
Another day shall still unfold, 

A sun of milder radiance rise, 

A happier age of joys untold. 

“ Shall the poor worm that shocks thy sight, 

The humblest form in Nature’s train, 

Thus rise in new-born lustre bright, 

And vet the emblem teach in vain ? 



” Ah ! where w r ere once her golden eyes, 
Her glittering wings of purple pride ? 
Conceal’d beneath a rude disguise, 

A shapeless mass, to earth allied. 

“ Like thee the hapless reptile lived, 

Like thee he toil’d, like thee he spun, 

Like thine his closing hour arrived, 

His labour ceased, his web was done. 

“ And shalt thou, number'd with the dead, 
No happier state of being know? 

And shall no future morrow shed 
On thee a beam of brighter glow ? 





“ Is this the bound of power divine, 

To animate an insect frame ? 

Or shall not He who moulded thine 
Wake at his will the vital flame ? 

Cl Go, mortal! in thy reptile state, 

Enough to know to thee is given; 

Go, and the joyful truth relate; 

Frail child of earth ! high heir of heaven !” 


Emma. 

Thank you, Papa; it is a beautiful poem. 
It makes me long to hear more about these 
changes. I really begin to be yerv much 
interested in insects. 

Mr. B. 

I am glad, my loye, if your interest is excited 
on a subject which I have myself pursued with 
so much delight. It will be, I assure you, a 
gratifying task to give you such a familiar intro¬ 
duction to it, as your Mamma proposes. I 
think you will find in the history of insects 
much to amuse and much to instruct you ; 
and that as we go on, you will acknowledge 
that I have not too warmly recommended a study 



so replete with interesting wonders. 




It is indeed matter of surprise to me, that 
subjects such as these, which have so direct a 
tendency to cultivate the taste, and to induce 
habits of observation, and a fondness for the 
simple pleasures of nature, are not more generally 
pursued by young ladies.

I am under a promise, Emma, said Mr. B., 
of giving von a little peep into the wonders of 
the insect world ; and if it will be agreeable to 
you and Mamma, I shall be happy to devote 
this evening to the subject. 

Emma. 

Thank you, Papa. I have been longing 
rather impatiently tor your first leisure evening. 

Mr. B. 

In giving you this peep, it is not my intention 





to burden you with any thing that you might 
consider dry . My only object will be to give 
you such a general and familiar view of the 
economy of this interesting part of creation, 
as may bespeak for it your favourable regard; 
and induce you still further to pursue a study 
so well calculated to amuse a leisure hour, and 
to fill up the vacuities of thought with profitable 
contemplations. 

Most insects pass through four distinct states: 
the egg, the caterpillar, the chrysalis, and the 
perfect insect; or, to speak scientifically, the 
egg, the larva, the pupa, and the imago. I 
am not fond of the pedantry of using scientific 
words, when those in common use would answer 
the purpose as well; but as we have no terms 
in our language that apply to the different states 
of all insects, it is more convenient, when we 
speak of them generally, to employ those whieh 
have been invented for the purpose. 

Emma. 

I suppose then caterpillars, maggots, and grubs, 
are all called larva ? 

Mr. B. 

Yes: the term larva is applied to all insects 





in their second state, and pupa in their third. 
The words caterpillar, maggot, grub, and chrysalis, 
nymph, semi-nymph, cased-nymph, &c. definitely 
pointing out the sort of larva or pupa meant; 
just as in botany, you know, the common term 
pericarp applies to all seed vessels; while the 
several kinds are designated by the names capsule, 
silicle, legume, berry, &c. 

To begin then with these little creatures where 
Nature begins, I must first tell you a little about 
them in their egg state; though some say that 
the egg ought not to be called a state at all; 
because the insect does not exist till it is hatched 
into life. We shall not attempt, however, to 
settle this question. 

The egg's of insects alone would furnish materials 



for an interesting little volume. 

One peculiarity in them is the great variety 
of their forms. The eggs of birds are, as you 
know, nearly all of the same shape; but those of 
insects present almost every conceivable variety 
of outline, as well as of ornament and colour. 

I have put a few into the microscope. This 
is the egg of a nettle butterfly.* 



Emma. 

How curious! it looks like a little melon. 

Mr. B. 

And this is one of a cabbage butterfly.* 

Emma. 

0 that is prettier still; it is in the shape of 
an oil-flask, and looks as if it were made of 
fine Indian wicker-work. How exactly and 
delicately all the longitudinal ridges are con¬ 
nected by lines crossing them ! 

Mr. B. 

This is a gnat’s eggf; can you find a com¬ 
parison for it? 

Emma. 

The form is extremely elegant; I think it 
is like some antique vase I have seen. 

Mr. B. 

The variety of colours is also remarkable. 
Most are white when first laid; but after a 
little exposure to the air, some turn red, others 
green, blue, orange, or black. Some too are 
beautifully speckled and others are striped. This 
gnat’s egg, you observe, already looks green¬ 
ish; it will soon become entirely green, and at 
length, before hatching will turn grey- 
* Plate I. Fig. 13. f Plate I. Fig. 4. 


Another peculiarity in the eggs of insects is the 
great number usually deposited. In this, how¬ 
ever, different species vary considerably. There 
is one kind of fly that lays only two eggs; and 
there are other flies that lay only six or eight. 



The flea lays, twelve; and the burying beetle 
thirty. There are exceptions to the remark. Of 
other insects the number varies from one hundred 
eggs to two hundred thousand and even more. 
The silk-worm moth lays, I believe, five hundred; 
the great goat moth, a thousand; the tiger moth, 
sixteen hundred; the female wasp, at least thirty 
thousand ; and the queen bee sometimes forty or 
fifty thousand. With the exception of fishes, in¬ 
sects exceed in fecundity all other orders of animals. 

Emma. 

It seems then unaccountable that they are not 
still more numerous than we find them to be. 

Mr. B. 

They have various enemies in every stage of 
their progress from the egg to the mature state. 
The unhatched eggs often fall a prey to the larvae 
first extruded; and of those that are hatched, 
vast numbers are destroyed by birds, and other 
insectivorous creatures. It has been calculated 





that a single pair of sparrows, having young ones 
to maintain, will destroy more than three thousand 
caterpillars in a week. They have also foes among 
their own class; of which the most remarkable 
are the little four winged flies, called by Linnaeus 
ichneumons , from the resemblance of their proceed¬ 
ings with caterpillars to the fabled proceedings 
of the Egyptian ichneumon with the crocodile. 
These little enemies, some of which are scarcely 
so big as ants, do the work of destruction among 
the larvae of different insects far more efficiently 
than could be done by any human means. 

One of these minute murderers has been seen to 
perch on the back of an unwary caterpillar, and 
gently piercing the insect’s skin in various places, 
to deposit as many as thirty eggs. The grubs of 
these eggs, when hatched, feed on the body of the 
caterpillar; and when full grown, eat their way 
out, leaving their victim to die. 

Another interesting subject of remark in connec¬ 
tion with the eggs of insects, is the care exhibited 
by the parent for their protection. 

Some, as the various species of spiders, and one 
family of water-beetles, spin a silken pouch in 
which to enclose them; others smear them over 





with varnish ; and many, whose eggs are tender, 
or have to resist the wet and cold of winter, defend 
them in a most skilful manner with a covering of 
different kinds of substance: I have read of one 
species of moth, of which the mother actually makes 
a shelter for them of hair stripped from her own 
bodv. She first forms a soft couch of this hair on 
the surface of some leaf; she then places upon it 
successive layers of eggs, and surrounds them 
with a similar downy covering; and when the 
whole number is deposited, covers the surface 
with a roofing of hairs. Those used for the interior 
are placed without order; but those employed 
externally are arranged with as much skill as 
the tiles on a house, and as effectually keep 
out the water; one layer resting partly on the 
other, and all having the same direction, so 
that the whole resembles a well-brushed piece 
of fur. 

Several insects make leaves, and other parts 
of plants serve as coverings for their eggs. 
Some of the saw-flies, for instance, make an 
incision with their saws in the green twigs of 
a shrub or tree, and fill it with a line of eggs 
placed end to end, taking care to leave room 
for the growth of the eggs. 



Mrs. B. 

What instinctive skill! But I was not aware 
that the eggs of insects grow. 

Mr. B. 

Some do; particularly those of the saw-flies, 
the gall-flies, and the ants. They usually in¬ 
crease to double their original size before they 
are hatched. 

Emma. 

Do all insects cover their eggs ? 

Mr. B. 

No, not all. The only care of some is to 
place them upon or near the food appropriated 
to the young larvae. This is never neglected; 
for there are no improvident parents in the 
insect world. Most butterflies and moths attach 
their eggs to the stems, twigs, and leaves, or 
embryo fruits of trees or plants. The lady¬ 
birds and some others deposit theirs in the 
midst of plant lice; the flesh-flies generally 
gum theirs upon flesh; the house-fly lays hers 
in horse-dung; those of crickets and grasshoppers 
are buried in the earth; and those of the gnat are 



set afloat upon the water; two or three hundred of 
them being glued together, side by side, so as very 
much to resemble in shape a little life-boat. 

 


Mrs. B. 

I believe few insects neglect order in the dis¬ 
posal of their eggs. 

Mr. B. 

No: “ Order is Heaven’s first law/’ and it 
prevails in all the unfallen parts of God’s creation. 
Sometimes, it is true, the eggs are placed in what 
appears a confused mass; but in most instances 
they are arranged in various, and frequently in very 
beautiful modes. The common cabbage butterfly, 
and many others, place them upon one end, side 
by side, like a close column of soldiers; the eggs 
of the emperor moth are piled in two or more 
lines like bottles of wine in a bin ; and the lackey 
moth, whose eggs you may often find in winter, 
surrounding the twigs of fruit-trees, arranges them 
in numerous circles with such admirable art, that 
you would take them rather for pearls, set by the 
hand of a jeweller, than for the eggs of an insect. 
The French gardeners call them bracelets. 

Some insects deposit their eggs singly; but still 
with the same attention to the safety of the egg, 
and the future wants of the offspring. The nut 
and the acorn-weevil pierce a nut or an acorn 
while soft, with the r long beak, and then deposit 




in the hole an egg, the maggot of which is supplied 
by the kernel with appropriate food. 

Emma. 

I have often found plums and other fruits 
maggoty. I suppose the egg was laid in the 
fruit by the parent insect. 

Mr. B. 

Yes: the eggs are often glued to the embryo 
fruit, even before the petals fall off; so that the 
caterpillars, on being disclosed, find themselves 
on a tender germ, which they easily pierce, and 
into the interior of which they can without 
difficulty introduce themselves. It is remarkable 
that the peach and the apricot are entirely free 
from such intrusions. 

But the most singular labour of the parent 
insect, in making provision for its offspring, is 
that of the sand wasps. It was first noticed 
by Ray, one of our earliest entomologists, nearly 
two hundred years ago, and has been frequently 
verified since. There are several species of these 
insects, but the proceedings of them all are similar. 
They first dig in the sand or earth a cylin¬ 
drical cavity of the requisite dimensions, and 
having deposited an egg at the bottom, enclose 




along with it one or more caterpillars, spiders, 
or other insects, as a provision for the young 
when hatched, and sufficiently abundant to nourish 
it till it becomes a pupa. These victims are put 
in alive ; and if, as is not unfrequently the case, 
they attempt to defend themselves, a few stings 
effectually deprive them of all power of resistance. 

The mason wasps do nearly the same. They 
bury with the egg eight or nine small green cater¬ 
pillars, selecting such as having attained their 
full size, will themselves require no more food. 
To prevent the possibility of injury to the egg, 
they coil the caterpillars one above another in 
a series of rings, and consolidate the earth so 
firmly around them, that they have not the 
slightest power of resistance. In this position 
the poor captives remain confined, till the grub 
of the wasp, awaking to life, devours them. 

But I am entering on an almost endless subject • 
for every different species of insect has some plan, 
peculiar to its kind, of making provision for its off¬ 
spring ; though, in most cases, that offspring it will 
never live to see. As I before remarked, there is 
no insect that u provides not for its own, ” 



Mrs. B, 

It would be well if some parents among mankind 
would take a lesson from them. 

Mr. B. 

It would indeed. 

Emma. 

Are the eggs in general long in hatching ? 

Mr. B. 

They vary very much in the time requisite 
for that purpose; some require only a few hours, 
others, several months. Much of course depends 
on the temperature of the atmosphere. 

The eggs of many flesh-flies are hatched in 
our climate in twenty-four hours; those of bees 
in three days; while those of beetles, and indeed 
of some butterflies too, require from one to nine 
months. The eggs of most insects laid in autumn 
remain unhatched till the following spring. 

Emma. 

I suppose no insects hatch their own eggs 
as birds do, 

Mr. B. 

Not exactly as birds do, certainly; for as 
insects generally have no vital heat, they cannot 
impart any. There are one or two.* however^. 





that have been observed to brood over their eggs 
and their voung ones too. One insect to which I 



believe you have a peculiar aversion does this. 

Emma. 

0 Papa! never refer again, if you please, to my 
silly prejudices. I am quite ashamed of them. 

Mr. B. 

Then I may venture to introduce to you a female 



earwig, as an insect that very nearly approaches the 
habits of the anxious hen in her care of her 
family. She absolutely sits upon her eggs, as if 
to hatch them ; and when they are hatched, broods 
over her young ones with the greatest tenderness, 
suffering them to creep under her and to push 
between her feet, just as chickens do under a hen. 

Emma. 

I should much like to see it for mvself. 



Mr. B. 

You seem a little sceptical on the subject; but I 
can assure you it has been repeatedly observed. 
Should you ever be so diligent an entomologist as 
to turn up stones embedded in the earth to discover 
the inhabitants that may be under them, you will, 
in all probability, at some time be gratified by the 
sight of a mother earwig thus brooding over a 
cluster of young ones. 





Here comes Frederick. I hope he has been 
successful in his search. I requested him to go 
this afternoon into the shrubbery and gardens, or 
wherever he thought he should be most likely to 
succeed, to find for us as many caterpillars and 
grubs as he could; for it is always best, where it 
is practicable, to have the living insect before us. 

Frederick. 

Well, Father : I think you will say that I have 
executed your commission with some success. 
Here are caterpillars, grubs, and maggots of various 
sorts and sizes. Thomas went with me, and 
having provided ourselves with a large cloth which 
we fixed underneath the boughs and as close to 
them as we could, we brushed nearly every shrub 
and tree in the grounds and in the neighbouring 
copse; and I can assure you we have literally 
left no stone unturned. 

Mr. B. 

We are all much obliged by your diligent ex¬ 
ertions. You have indeed brought a variety of 
larvae, and I am glad to see that you have put into 
the box with each a supply of its appropriate food. 

Emma. 

I never saw such a collection of caterpillars 
and grubs before! 





Mrs. B. 

Do you not admire their beauty and variety '? 
There are scarcely two at all alike. Some are all 
of one colour, others are of different colours, very 
bright and gaily contrasted; some are marked in 
longitudinal stripes; some, in bands; and some, in 
waves. Some again have a soft smooth skin; 
others have it rough, almost like shagreen; and 
others have as beautiful a coat of hair as our 
tortoise-shell cat. 

Mr. B. 

One colour, so far as utility to the insect is com 
cerned, would probably be as good as another. 
The only assignable reason for such a variety there¬ 
fore, appears to be our gratification. And thus it 
is in every department of nature; wherever we 
look, we find the beautiful as well as the useful ; 
that which is pleasant to the sight, as well as that 
which is necessary to the purposes of creation. It 
is remarkable that the colours of caterpillars, with 
few exceptions, are very different indeed from those 
of the insects into which they are transformed. 
Plain and inconspicuous caterpillars will some¬ 
times give splendidly coloured flies ; while finely 
marked caterpillars will give plain ones. This 
caterpillar, (Bombyx Neustria) for instance, 




whose gaudy stripes of blue, white, and red, have 
obtained for it the name of lackey , will disclose a 
yellowish moth, with stripes on the wings of 
yellow brown. 

Emma. 

The caterpillars are certainly very pretty; but 
do not you think, Mamma, that some of the grubs 
are disgusting looking creatures ? 

Mrs. B. 

I do not call them disgusting , Emma. Nothing 
deserves to be so called that keeps the place, and 
fulfils the purpose, for which providence designed 
it. Their naked, unadorned appearance is not 
perhaps inviting; but you should remember that 
they have been brought from their hiding places 
under the turf or stones; and that they were not in¬ 
tended to meet the human eye till, on attaining their 
perfect state, they assumed their beautiful covering. 

Mr. B. 

You understand, Emma, that these are insects in 
their second or larva state. But I ought to ex¬ 
plain to you that larva is a Latin word signifying 
a mask; and that it was adopted by Linn£, be¬ 
cause the insect, such as it afterwards appears, lies 
masked as it were, or concealed, under this extern 
nal form 9 




Emma. 

Do you mean to say, Papa, that a butterfly lies 
concealed in this caterpillar ? 

Mr. B. 

Yes, my dear. The butterfly, with its organs in¬ 
deed in an almost fluid state, but still perfect in all 
its parts, lies encased within the caterpillar. Of 
this fact it would be easy to convince you, by 
boiling a full grown caterpillar for a few minutes, 
or by laying it for a few days in vinegar or spirits 
of wine, for the purpose of giving consistency to 
its parts; a veiy rough dissection would then 
discover to you the future butterfly. Its wdngs 
you would see rolled up into a sort of cord, and 
lodged between the first and second segment 
of the body; the antennae and trunk, coiled up in 
front of the head ; and the legs, however different 
in form, actually sheathed in the present legs of 
the insect. 

You observe that instead of an internal skeleton, 
the covering of the body in these larvae is divided 
into a certain number of rings jointed together. 
On this account, insects are sometimes called 
annulose animals, from annulus , a ring; and some¬ 
times articulated animals, from articulus , a joints 




These rings are united by bands of muscles, 
which enable them to bend the body with ease, in 
any direction, as you see they all can do. 

Mrs. B. 

The muscular power of caterpillars must be 
very great. I have frequently observed them 
fixed by their hind legs only, to a branch, and 
looking like a little twig of it, and in that position 
sustaining themselves for a considerable time with¬ 
out the least motion.* 

Mr. B. 

The number of muscles which their bodies 
contain is immense. Lyonet counted those in the 
body of the caterpillar of the great goat moth, 
(Cossus Ligntyerda) and found altogether four 
thousand and sixty-one. In the human subject, 
I believe, not more than five hundred and twenty- 
nine have been counted; so that this minute animal 
has three thousand five hundred and thirty-two 
muscles more than a man. 

The various attitudes they assume, are indeed a 
sufficient proof of the number and strength of their 
muscles. 

Let us look for a minute at the heads of these 
larvae. They are, you observe, of a horny sub- 




stance, and are all naked, whatever may be the 
covering of the other parts of the body. 

Emma. 

And where not of the same colour as the body, 
they seem to be all of a reddish brown. 

Mr. B. 

That is the most usual colour of the head. 

Frederick. 

Have insects in the larva state the sense of sight ? 

Mr. B. 

Many have not; but a still greater number have. 
With few exceptions, however, the eyes are simple, 
and do not present the same complexity of struc¬ 
ture as in the perfect insect. Most caterpillars 
have twelve such eyes, but so minute that they 
are nearly invisible without the aid of a microscope. 
They have also, most of them at least, that 
beautiful appendage to the head of the perfect 
insect, antennae: though generally speaking, of a 
much smaller and plainer form. 

Emma. 

It is unnecessary to ask whether they have 
mouths: how rapaciously most of them are de¬ 
vouring the leaves! 




Mrs. B. 

O yes: they have all mouths, and mouths well 
furnished with implements of destruction. Most 
of them have something analogous to jaws and 
teeth, of a hard horny substance, and moved by 
powerful muscles. The jaws of a caterpillar do 
not act perpendicularly, as ours do, but horizon¬ 
tally, or from side to side. Generally speaking, 
they are slightly bent, something in the form of a 
reaping hook, and are made to meet like the blades 
of a pair of pincers. Altogether they are a 
formidable apparatus, well adapted to their purpose. 

Emma. 

Only look, Frederick, this caterpillar has nearly 
consumed this large leaf already! 

Mr. B. 

A caterpillar may be compared to an Indian 
hunter; it issues from the egg, as he does from 
his hut, with a keen appetite. The quantity larvse 
eat is astonishing. A cabbage caterpillar will 
consume more than twice its own weight in twenty- 
four hours; and the maggots of many flesh flies 
will in a night and day, devour so much as to in¬ 
crease their weight two hundred fold. 




Mrs. B. 

I tliink I have read that a silk worm consumes 
within thirty days, about sixty thousand times its 
original weight. 



Mr. B. 

The weight of the silk worm at first, is to be 
sure, very minute, and its growth rapid; so that 
it is difficult to institute a comparison between it 
and other creatures; but it appears a prodigious 
consumption. A human being in health would 
require I suppose in the same time, about once 
his own weight of solid and liquid aliment. 

Frederick. 

Did not Linne say that the larvae of three 
blue-bottle flies would consume the carcass of a 
horse as quickly as a lion would ? 

Mr. B. 

Yes: and I do not think it is an exaggerated 
description of their voracity. Some flies of that 
species produce twenty thousand larvae. Sixty 
thousand of these insects, each consuming in 
twenty-four hours two hundred times its own 
weight, would do something towards demolishing 



even a larger carcass. 

It appears indispensable for most insects, in 




this stage of their existence, to feed copiously, 
in order to supply a store of nutriment for their 
future changes; and their intestines are almost all 
stomach for receiving and digesting the masses of 
food they consume; but when they attain their 
perfect state, the stomach is reduced to a thread, 
and many of them eat nothing at all. 

Emma. 

What a number of legs the caterpillars have! 

Mr. B. 

None of them have more than six proper legs, 
which are placed in three pairs near the head. 
The other little processes which you take for legs, 
are merely tubercles, or false feet, wdiich serve to 
support the length of the body, and sometimes act 
as cramps in walking; but, generally speaking, they 
have no joints, and consequently no free motion. 

It is only the caterpillars, you observe, that have 
these jirolegs, as they are called. These grubs of 
beetles, you see, have only the six proper legs; 
and the grubs and maggots of many other kinds 
of insects have no legs at all. Those larvae that 
have legs are called pedate larvae, or larvae with 
feet; those that have none, apod larvae, or larvae 
without feet. 





You must not, however, suppose that those 
without feet are therefore incapable of motion. In 
general, their mode of life makes a frequent 
change of place less necessary to them than it 
is to the pedate larvae ; but, I assure you, they 
can move when occasion requires it, and some 
of them verv nimbly too : some walk, others 
jump, and others swim, notwithstanding their 
want of limbs. 

Emma. 

I suppose the grubs we meet with in nuts 
are among; the walkers. I have often wondered 
how thev manage to move so fast without feet. 

Mr. B. 

The grub of the nut-weevil is a good specimen 
of them. It walks by the alternate contraction 
and extension of the segments of the bodv; 
assisted, perhaps, by the fleshy protuberances 
of its sides; and the maggots of the cheese-fly, 
commonly called hoppers, which revel in our 
richest cheeses, afford an example of the jumpers. 
They effect their tremendous leaps, for truly they 
are so when compared with their size, nearly as 
salmon are said to pass over cataracts, by taking 
the tail in the mouth, and then suddenly letting 





it go. Swammerdam saw one, whose length 
did not exceed the fourth part of an inch, jump 
thus out of a box, six inches in depth; which 
is equal to a leap of a hundred and forty-four 
feet to a man six feet high. 

Mrs. B. 

Swammerdam was a great admirer of this little 
maggot. He speaks, I remember, in high terms 
of its elegance, and of the art and design dis* 
played in its formation, as conveying a strong 
proof that it is the production of infinite power 
and wisdom. 

Mr. B. 

I quite agree with him. Only think how 
wonderful must be the muscular structure that 
enables it to exert such activity! 

Emma. 

You say, Papa, that some larvae swim—are 
there any insects in the sea ? 

Mr. B. 

No: there are no insects inhabiting the sea; 
but many pass the first stage of their existence 
in fresh water. You remember the little boat 
of eggs which the gnat entrusts to the watery 
element; and there are many others, the dragon 





flies, for example, that begin their existence in 
water; where, by feeding on the impurities of 
stagnant ditches and pools, they render us services 
of incalculable value: preventing by their vigi¬ 
lance, putrid exhalations which might produce 
fatal disorders. 

I have here in a tumbler, as a specimen of 
the swimmers, a few grubs of the common gnat. 
During this hot summer weather they may be 
met with in abundance in ditches and waterbutts, 
or any stagnant water. 

Emma. 

They look something like little, transparent, 
whitish shrimps or fishes. 

Mr. B. 

If disposed to descend, you observe, they 
appear to sink by the weight of the body: but 
when they would rise again, it is done by alternate 
contortions of the upper and lower halves of it. 
They thus swim with much celerity. 

It would take long to enumerate all the different 
motions observable in insects, even in their larva 
state; in the pedate larvae especially; some are 
remarkable for the slowness of their pace; others 
run with extreme swiftness ; some jump, and 
others swim. But I cannot dismiss the subject 





without mentioning one species of motion pecu¬ 
liar to them;—I mean their mode of climbing. 
I will put this cabbage-caterpillar on a pane of 
glass, and he will show you their plan. Do 
you not perceive that he has left a visible track 
behind him? Apply the magnifying glass, and 
you will see that that track consists of little silken 
threads, spun in a zigzag manner, and forming 
a sort of rope-ladder, by which he ascends a 
surface he could not otherwise adhere to. The 
silk, as it proceeds from the caterpillar, is a 
gummy fluid which hardens in the air; so that 
the insect has no difficulty in making it stick 
to the glass. 

Many caterpillars that feed upon trees, use 
ropes instead of ladders; particularly the Geo - 
metricians , as they are called. I am glad to 
find that Frederick has brought us specimens 
of them. As these insects have frequent occasion 
to descend from branch to branch, and sometimes 
to the ground, if they were obliged to traverse 
the rugged trunk, their journeys would be tedious 
and fatiguing; but by means of a silken cord 
which they can let down from their own internal 
stores to any length, they can descend conveniently 




and expeditiously, travel where they please, and 
when they wish to return, can find their way 
back to the leaf they had left. Thus they can 
drop themselves from the most lofty trees ; and by 
gathering in, as they go home, the thread they 
spun on their way out, can ascend again with 
great facility. 

Emma. 

I have often seen them hanging by their little 
threads; there is one tree in the garden at school 
famous for them; but we always avoid going 
under it, for fear they should fall upon us.— 
In future I shall look at them with different 
feelings. 

Frederick. 

Just like young ladies at school! 

Mr. B. 

You see then one of the advantages of science; 
it sometimes gives even an attractive charm to 
that which otherwise would be an object of 
disgust. Many caterpillars, however, drop them¬ 
selves in this manner besides those properly called 
Geometricians. 

Emma, 

Why are they called Geometricians ? 




Mr. B. 

Because they seem to imitate geometricians 
by measuring the surface they pass oyer as if 
with a chain. Place this on your hand, and 
you will find that it draws a thread as it goes; 
when it moves, its head is extended as far as 
it can reach with it; then, fastening the thread 
there, it brings up the rest of its body, and 
takes another step; never moving without leaving 
this clue behind it. 

Mrs. B. 

The Processionary caterpillars are the most 
amusing to me in their movements. I remember 
once, as we were travelling, stopping at a plant¬ 
ation of pine-trees to observe some; and very 
interesting it was to see them all issuing from 
their tent in company, and maintaining as exact 
an order in their march as a regiment of soldiers. 
They defiled one by one with an equal and rather 
slow step, the head of the caterpillar which 
followed, touching the tail of its predecessor. 
Sometimes they went in a straight line; some¬ 
times they described a variety of curves, 
resembling beautiful festoons or garlands. Their 
path they carpeted with a silken tapestry of a 




lustrous white, nearly a quarter of an inch in 
breadth. Indeed, they appeared unable to walk 
but on this silken carpet;—for a young friend 
who was with me, was mischievous enough to 
draw her finger across the path, so as to tear 
out a piece of it, by which the poor little travellers 
seemed to be thrown into the greatest embarrass¬ 
ment. They all suddenly stopped, and the march 
appeared suspended, until one, bolder or more 
impatient than the rest, dared to cross the gap. 
The thread it spun in crossing, became a bridge 
for another; and each one, as it successively 
passed, contributing its thread, the path was soon 
repaired. 

Mr. B. 

There is another species of gregarious cater¬ 
pillar that inhabit oak trees, though not found 
in our country, which are more particularly 
called Processionaries. During the heat of the 
day they usually repose, seven or eight hundred 
of them together, in their common habitation ; 
but when the evening hour of repast arrives, 
they quit the nest in procession, and may be 
seen traversing the distance from one tree to 
another, in search of food. A single caterpillar 





opens the march, the others follow in file, and 
sometimes two, three, or four abreast. Such 
perfect order is observed among them that the 
head of one never passes that of another. When 
they find a branch covered with fresh leaves, 
they spread themselves over it, still remaining 
close to each other ; and when they have ter¬ 
minated their repast, they march back to their 
nest in the original order, the same caterpillar 
still taking the lead. 

Emma. 

How pretty it must be to see them! 

What are these little dots or spots along the 
sides of the caterpillars ? I see they all have them, 
and the grubs too. Through the magnifying 
glass they have a very curious appearance. 

Mr. B. 

I am glad you have asked the question. They 
are called spiracles , and are the little apertures 
through which the insect breathes. 

Emma. 

Indeed! 

Mr. B. 

Insects in all their states breathe through these 
spiracles, or something analogous to them, and 






in most, they are placed along the sides. Some 
larvae that are intended to feed on flesh or dung, 
or other adhesive food, have instead respiratory 
plates, two at the head and two at the tail, and so 
arranged as to secure them from being stopped up 
by any unctuous matter; and the larvae of gnats 
and other aquatic insects have a curious breathing 
apparatus near the tail. You see these all have 
their tails at the surface of the water. Spiders 
also are an exception; they have gills instead of 
spiracles. 

The discoveries of modern science have satis¬ 
factorily proved that the physiology of insects 
differs in many essential particulars from that of 
the higher orders of animals. It was once 
supposed that 

. -each within its little bulk contains 

A heart that drives the torrent through the veins 

but it is now clearly ascertained that as the minute 
structures and short-lived existence of insects do 
not require so complicated an apparatus of life as 
is needed by creatures of larger size and longer 
duration, they have neither veins nor heart, and 
consequently no “torrent” passing through them : 
and that they are nourished by fluids pervading 




every part of the body without circulation; while, 
a s I have just said, they receive air by apertures 
conveniently placed along the sides. 

Frederick. 

I went down to the river to see if I could 
find the larva of a dragon fly, that Emma might 
be entertained with a sight of its curious mask; 
but I am sorry to say, I did not succeed. 

Mrs. B. 

I have in my portfolio a sketch of one, from 
which, with Papa’s assistance, she will form a 
very good idea of it.—Here it is. 

Mr. B. 

This is a very correct delineation of one of these 
murderous insects. The mask* is represented as 
applied close to and covering the face : it does so 
while the insect is at rest, or waiting for prey; 
but no sooner does the unwary victim approach, 
than the ferocious little animal first opens the 
upper part of it, which is formed of two jaw¬ 
like plates; then, having by means of [a joint 
at the chin, let down the whole visor, and un¬ 
covered the face, it catches up the prey by means 
of these plates, which it uses as arms, and conveys 



it to its mouth. Reaumur once found one of 
them thus holding and devouring a large tadpole. 

Emma. 

What a giant Grim ! 

Frederick. 

I was unexpectedly successful in capturing 
another larva, belonging, I believe, to the same 
order as the dragon-fly, and one that equally 
deserves the name of giant Grim . As I passed 
by the southern wall of the old castle, I spied 
a hole in the sand-bank; seeing two horns 
peeping out, I guessed at the tenant, and seized 
the giant in his lurking place, I have him here 
in a box filled with sand. 

Mr. B. 

An ant-lion, have you! You have indeed been 
very successful this evening. 

Emma. 

I am glad of that. I have often read of the 
cunning contrivances of the ant-lion; but I have 
no idea what sort of a creature it is. 

Mr. B. 

We will open the box, and you shall see.* 
You observe that it is of a greyish colour; and 




that it has six feet, and a body remarkably thick, 
in proportion to the corslet and head. The head, 
you see, is very small, and is armed with two 
horns, which answer the purpose of pincers and 
suckers. 

Emma. 

How very slender the legs are in comparison 

with the body ! 



Mr. B. 

It could not catch its prey by running, as you 
will easily believe; for it cannot run at all; and 
when it walks, it w r alks backwards, and very 
slowly; it therefore has recourse to stratagem. 
Forming in a dry sandy situation a funnel-shaped 
hollow of suitable dimensions, it hides itself 
in ambush at the bottom, projecting only its 
horns, ready to seize its unwary prey. Woe 
to any imprudent insect, the ant especially, that 
in proceeding on its way, dares to approach 
this cavern. On coming near the edge, it in¬ 
evitably slides into the pit; or if it keep at a 
cautious distance, the lurking enemy, as soon as 
he sees it, showers upon it with his head, which 
he uses as a shovel, such a quantity of sand that 
the ant becomes completely stunned; and, tumbling 


to the bottom of the hole, is seized between the 
murderous pincers of the foe, and dragged under 
the sand, to be sucked to death at leisure. Having 
drawn from it all that is nutritive, the ant-lion 
places the dried carcass upon its head and legs, 
and by a sudden jerk, casts it beyond the outer 
circle of this pitfall. 

Emma. 

What a horrid little murderer! But its historv 
is interesting. 

Mr. B. 

Unlike most other insects in this respect, 
the ant-lion is far more interesting in its larva 
than in its mature state. When it arrives at 
maturity, and assumes its elegant form and light 
gauze wings, forgetting all its carnivorous pro¬ 
pensities, it gaily sallies forth, chiefly in the 
evening, to revel on the honeyed juices of fruits 
and flowers ; and its life is henceforth a perpetual 
feast of ambrosial sweets. 

Frederick. 

How long do insects usually remain in the larva 
state ? 

Mr. B. 

The length of time varies considerably; but it 
is, in all cases, nicely adapted to their several 



functions and modes of life. The grubs of the 
flesh-fly have attained their full size and are ready 
to become pupae in six or seven days; the larvae 
of bees in twenty days; while those of the great 
goat moth and cock-chafer live three years 
before their changes. Some live even longer than 
this: the wire worm, which is one of the great 
enemies of the farmer, and is the larva of a species 
of beetle, remains in this state five years; and the 
stag beetle is said to remain in it for even six years. 
With few exceptions it is found that those larvae 
which live on dead animals, in fungi, in dung, 
and in similar substances, are of the shortest 
duration in this state; and those that live under 
the earth on the roots of grass and plants, or in 
wood, the longest: the former becoming pupae in a 
few days or weeks, the latter, requiring several 
months or even years to bring them to maturity. 
Those which live on the leaves of plants, seem to 
have a middle term between the one and the other.* 
But it is almost time to say good night. Should 
nothing prevent, I hope to-morrow evening to 
resume the subject, and to give you a few particulars 
of insects in their pupa state. 


* Kirby. 


THIRD EVENING. 


Mode of obtaining pupae; breeding cage for insects.— 
Moulting of larvae.—Preparations for assuming the 
pupa; silk employed by numerous insects.—Explana¬ 
tion of the term pupa; chrysalis, nymph, cased-nympb, 
semi-nymph, complete pupa.—Length of time that 
insects remain in the pupa state.—Many have a 
fixed hour for disclosing the perfect insect; the silk¬ 
worm, hawk-moth, ephemerae. 


I have endeavoured, Father, said Frederick as 
he entered, to be present at the commencement of 
your lecture this evening ; for if you will allow me, 
I shall much like to share with Emma, in the 
instructions you have engaged to give her. 

Supposing that the contribution of a few 
specimens would again be acceptable, I have been 
hunting in every hollow tree and over every piece 
of wall and paling to find you a few pupae; but I 
have met with only two. 

I have found however a veiy curious caterpillar, 
it seems covered over with little yellow silken 
balls. 





Mr. B. 

This is a caterpillar, Emma, which has been 
destroyed as I described to you, by an ichneumon 
these little yellow balls are cocoons, which 
the grubs that fed on the body of the insect, 
formed for themselves, on eating their way out 
of it. 

To obtain pupse, the best way is to dig for 
them under the spreading branches of trees, 
or under turf: but it is almost too early yet; 
they are found most abundantly at the end of 
July, or the beginning of August; and some 
species in January and February. An6ther good 
plan is to take the insects in their larva state, and 
provide them with such accommodation as their 
habits require. 

Mr. F. who is, you know, a very curious 
observer of insects, has a box, about two feet 
long, twelve inches high, and six broad, divided 
into six compartments. The lower half is con¬ 
structed entirely of wood, and the upper, of 
coarse gauze stretched upon wood or wire frames. 
Each compartment has a separate door, and is 
filled to the height of six inches, with a mixture 





of fine earth, and the dust from the inside of rotten 
trees; it is moreover furnished with a phial in the 
centre for the purpose of containing water, in which 
the food is kept fresh; and on the surface of the 
mould he places a thick layer of moss, which he 
saturates with water, as often as is needful, for the 
purpose of preserving a sufficient degree of moisture. 
Into the different compartments of this cage, he puts 
any caterpillars or grubs he may find, taking care to 
keep each supplied with its appropriate food in a 
fresh state. By this means he has been successful 
in making valuable observations on the habits and 
changes of various insects. 

I would advise you to procure such a box, if 
you wish to become a good practical entomologist. 

Frederick. 

I suppose the rotten wood is for the use of such 
larvae as construct their cocoons of that substance. 

Mr. B. 

Yes : and to make the soil less binding upon 
others. 

I purposely omitted last evening one curious 
particular relating to larvae, because it is intimately 
connected with the change to the pupa state : I 
mean their moulting or change of skin. 





A change in the exterior covering of the body 
takes place, as you know in other animals. Quad¬ 
rupeds renew their hair, and birds their feathers ; 
and even in the human species there is a gradual 
scaling off and renewal of the outer skin ; but in 
insects the whole outer skin is thrown off alto¬ 
gether, like an old garment that is out grown. 

The opinion of Swammerdam was, and it 
appears to be correct, that the larva includes a 
series of cases or envelopes one within the other, 
containing in the centre the germ of the future 
perfect insect, whose developement and final exclu¬ 
sion take place only when these cases have been 
successively thrown off. Each skin is perfectly 
formed from the first: in hairy caterpillars each 
has even the little tufts of hair lying in order 
something like so many minute hair pencils : and 
within these successive coverings, is the envelope 
which covers the insect in the pupa state. 

Different insects vary in the number of these 
skins. The silkworm has four. 

Frederick. 

I remember to have observed when I once kept 
silk worms that the first skin was cast at about 
twelve days from the birth; and the remaining 





three, each at the end of about six days from the 
moulting that preceded it. 

Mr. B. 

I am glad that you made such accurate ob¬ 
servations. 

Most caterpillars have four changes of skin : but 
some have only three, and there are some few 
that have a much greater number; some moult 
five, six, seven, and even ten times. Now only 
think of such a number of skins, not produced 
from time to time, as is the case with serpents, 
from the integument of the bodv, but lving one 
within the other, each separately and perfectly 
formed from the first, and provided with its 
various appendages for ornament or defence. 

Mrs. B. 

And not only is the body provided with this 
succession of coverings, but the head, the eyes, 
the antennas, and even the jaws, have, I believe, 
the same provision for change. I have seen 
the whole covering of the insect cast so entire, 
that it might be mistaken for the larva itself; 
there were the very skull, eyes, antennas, palpi, 
jaws, legs,—all hollow and empty. 





Emma. 

X should think it must be painful to the insect 
to undergo so entire a change of skin. 

Mr. B. 

There is no doubt that it is; and not unfre- 
quently fatal too. A day or two previous to 
each moult, the larva ceases eating altogether; 
it becomes languid and feeble; its beautiful 
colours fade; and it seeks for a safe retreat in 
which to undergo the operation. When it is 
over, the little creature is at first extremely weak; 
and it is not until after some hours, and, in some 
cases, even days, during which it lies without 
motion, that all its parts become consolidated, 
and it recovers sufficient strength to betake 
itself to its accustomed food; but when a few 
meals have invigorated its languid powers, the 
renovated insect makes up for its long abstinence 
by eating with double voracity.* 

Frederick. 

Do all larvae undergo these changes ? 

Mr. B. 

There are some exceptions. The maggot of 
the common flesh-fly never changes its skin; 

* Kirby. 





and the grubs of bees, wasps, and ants, do not 
change it till they assume the pupa. 

When the last time of casting the skin arriyes, 
and the pupa is about to be disclosed, the insect 
quits the plant or tree, on which it had liyed, and 
appears quite unsettled. You may often see one 
in this condition wandering about, and crossing 
the paths and roads, as if in quest of some new 
dwelling. The little creature has done with its 
former food and its former habits, and is prepar¬ 
ing to enter a new stage of existence. 



Some that feed under ground, or in the in¬ 
terior of trees, fruits, and seeds, such as beetles, bees, 
wasps, and some species of flies, merely rest in a 
state of inactivity in the midst of the substances 
which have supplied their nutriment. But a 
far greater number, when about to exchange their 
state of vigour and activity for the long period 
of death-like repose, exhibit the greatest anxiety 
about the choice of a safe retreat. Many, after 
wandering about, as if bewildered, retire to any 
small hole on the surface of the earth, and cover 
themselves with dead leaves or moss; or into 
the chinks of trees, or niches in walls, and other 
buildings. Others provide themselves with a 
grave, or rather a vault under ground, which they 




excavate by pushing away the surrounding earth, 
and the walls of which they render firm by means 
of a viscid fluid, poured from the mouth. The 
larva of the death’s head moth (Sphinx Atropos) 
thus inters itself at a depth of more than a foot 
from the surface. 

Having reached their selected retreat, many 
employ no other precaution. Some, however, 
as the lady-birds and tortoise-beetles, gum them¬ 
selves by the tail to the leaves or twigs, which 
they have chosen as a place of concealment. 
Many of the butterflies suspend themselves by 
silken cords, in a manner that would baffle the 
utmost effort of human ingenuity to contrive; 
and a great number wholly enclose themselves 
in cases or cocoons, composed of silk and various 
other materials. 

Emma. 

Do any insects besides silk-worms spin silken 
coverings ? 

Mr. B. 

Yes: many. For though Nature, when, as 
Milton speaks, she 

--“ Set to work millions of spinning worms, 

That in their green shops weave the smooth-hair’d silk, 

To deck her sons/' 






gave to silk-worms, if I may so express it, the mo¬ 
nopoly of this manufacture, yet she did not confine 
the power of producing silk to them, but con¬ 
ferred it, in inferior degrees, on various other 
insects. Most of the bee and ant tribes, some of 
the weevils and beetles, the ant-lions and others, 
fabricate for themselves silken cocoons. Even 
when other materials, such as leaves, decayed 
wood, sand, &c. are employed, silk is usually 
the cement that unites them together. 

Frederick. 

I remember you once showed me the cocoon 
of an ant-lion; it was round, and externally 
composed of grains of sand, cemented with silk; 
the interior was lined with silk of a satiny white, 
just fit to be the abode of the elegant insect that 
emerged from it. 

Mrs. B. 

I have a drawing of the cocoon of a species 
of moth, one of th e jihalejice, which I think remark¬ 
ably elegant. It is composed of leaves and flowers 
tied together with silk, and is suspended to a twig 
by layers of silken threads.* 




Mr. B. 

The phalenae are our little geometrical acquaint¬ 
ance. Many of them are industrious spinners, 
and very elegant in their habits. 

The most extensive silk manufacturers, however, 
are the various species of Bombyx . The Bom - 
byx proper is the common silk-worm, (Bombyx 
Mori;) but there are several nearly allied genera 
in our own country, whose strong white webs 
you must have observed upon the hedges and 
fruit trees, covering hundreds of caterpillars. Of 
these the webs of the Bombyx Chrysorrhcea are 
the most common. 

Emma. 

O ! I have seen them; but I always thought 
they were spiders' webs, which caterpillars had 
crept into. 

Mr. B. 

I do not suppose you ever thought much about 
the matter; or you would have thought how very 
different they are from spiders’ webs in form and 
substance too. 

Frederick. 

The lackey caterpillar, which I brought you 
yesterday, I took from among a large party that 




were regaling themselves under such silken tent 
upon the leaves of an apple-tree. 

Mr. B. 

The webs of the lackey caterpillars ( Bortibyx 
Neusti'ia) are frequently to be found on the fruit 
trees, and hedges too, for nothing comes amiss 
to them. 

The caterpillars inhabiting pine-trees, ( Bombyx 
Ablet is,) which your Mamma was describing 
yesterday as marching in such order, and carpet¬ 
ing their paths so curiously, dwell also together 
under an ample web or tent, formed of a strong 
kind of white silk. 

Wherever indeed you see a thick web on the trees, 



the grass, or the hedges, you may be pretty sure 
to find that there is or has been under it a colony 
of caterpillars. Some remain imder the web only 
for a time, and separate before the period of 
metamorphosis arrives, each to live in solitude; 
others remain in society through all their changes, 
and do not leave each other till they have 
attained maturitv. 



Emma. 

Are their productions of any use to us ? 




Mr. B. 

W e are not to estimate their use merely by their 
value to us. God cares for the wants of the insect, 
my dear Emma, as well as for those of the man. 

That we have not vet found a use for these webs 



is no proof that they might not be made of 
of service to us. I am inclined to think that some 
of these productions might, if cultivated, be em¬ 
ployed to advantage. The Bombyx Abietis forms 
a silken cocoon which could, it is believed, be 
manufactured, if proper pains were taken in pre¬ 
paring it. There is a species of these insects 
in Madagascar, whose silk is employed by the 
inhabitants. 

Well, after this digression on silk, let us return 
to the principal object for which it is produced by 
the insect,—the preparing of a secure retreat in 
which to pass through its greatest change. 

The insect forms the cocoon, you understand, 
while still in the larva state. Having done this, 
or made such other provision for security as in¬ 
stinct has dictated, after a time, the skin once 
more separates, and discloses an oblong body, 
which Linne called a pupa , from its resemblance 
in miniature to a child trussed up like a mummy, 




in swaddling bands, as young infants are in 
many parts of the continent :—pupa is the latin 
word for baby. In this state most insects 
require no food, and exhibit no other sign of life 
even when touched, than that of a slight move¬ 
ment of the abdomen. If opened, they seem 
filled with a watery fluid, in which no distinct 
organs can be traced. 

The pupae of different orders and species vary 
considerably; and different names, as I have 
already told you, have been applied to them. 
u Those of the beetle and bee tribes are covered 
with a membranous skin, inclosing in separate 
and distinct sheaths the antennae, legs, and wings, 
which are consequently not closely applied to the 
body, but have their form for the most part clearly 
distinguishable : these are called nymphs. 

Butterflies, moths, and some of the two-winged 
insects, are also inclosed in a similar membran¬ 
ous envelope ; but their legs, antennae, and wings, 
are so closely folded over the breast and sides, that 
they bear a strong resemblance to the mummies 
of ancient Egypt; and the whole body is inclosed 
in a case or covering of a horny consistence, which 
admits a much less distinct view of the organs be¬ 
neath it. To these the name of chrysalis is given. 




Frederick. 

The two pupae that I have found are of that 
description. 

Mr. B. 

Let us see them. This, which is of a greenish 
yellow, marked with spots of black, is the chrysalis 
of a cabbage butterfly; and this, which I should 
think you found not far from a bed of nettles, is 
that of a nettle or tortoise-shell butterfly. Only 
see, Emma, it shines as though gilded with bur¬ 
nished gold. 

The angular pupae of butterflies, of w T hieh these 
are examples, are among the most beautiful of 
pupae. They are often not only gaily decorated, 
but tinged of a golden colour, which obtained for 
them among the Romans the name of aurelice ; 
and among the Greeks, that of chrysalis . Linn6 
called them obtected pupae. 

The pupae of insects in general, however, do 
not present much that is beautiful in colour. 
The nymphs of bees, &c., which I have just 
described, are usually white, or whitish; and 
the cased-nymphs, as they are termed, of flies 
and some other two-winged genera, are generally 
of a reddish brown. The pupae of most moths 




are brown, of various shades, sometimes varying 
to black. 

Frederick. 

You said just now, Father, that most insects in 
the pupa state require no food, I thought there 
were none that did. 

Mr. B. 

In the metamorphoses of insects, as in other 
things, nature has observed no invariable rule. 
To by far the greater number the remark strictly 
applies, that in the pupa state they take no food; 
still it was necessary to qualify the assertion, 
because the pupae of a very considerable number 
including all the orthoptera, that is to say, the 
w r ell-known tribes of earwigs, grasshoppers, crick¬ 
ets, and locusts, with cockroaches, lanthorn-flies, 
froghoppers, bugs, plant-lice, dragon-flies, white 
ants, &c., are equally capable of moving and 
eating with the larvae, which they resemble, 
except in having the rudiments of wings bound 
down under a skin that keeps them confined. 
These are called semi-nymphs, or semi-complete 
pupce . 

Frederick. 

Then all insects do not lie for a time in a state 





of death-like repose. I think the terms larvae and 
pupae ought to be applied only to those that 
undergo these distinct changes, and not to such as 
preserve nearly the same form throughout their 
existence. 

Mr. B. 

It would perhaps be more strictly correct so to 
confine them: but as all insects vary more or less 
in their progress from the egg to the perfect state, 
these terms are found generally convenient. 

Emma. 

Spiders do not undergo any change do they ? 

Mr. B. 

Yes, they do \ and so do millepedes, centipedes, 
mites, scorpions, harvestmen, and various other 
wingless insects that to a casual observer appear 
always the same. Some differ in the number and 
length of their legs; some, in the number of the 
segments of the body; and some, in other particulars, 
which when you become a practised entomologist, 
you will understand : they all too in their progress 
to maturity cast their skins. Linn6 called such 
insects complete pupce } because they so nearly 
resemble the perfect insect. 

Now, Emma, can you enumerate the different 
kinds of pupae ? 





Emma. 

Yes, I think I can. The larva of the butterfly 
and moth becomes a chrysalis; that of the beetle 
and the bee, a nymph; that of the fly, a cased 
nymph; that of the grasshopper and dragon-fly 
a semi-nymph; and that of the spider a complete 
pupa . 

Frederick. 

Do insects remain in the pupa state long ? 

Mr.B. 

They vary very much in this respect. Gener¬ 
ally speaking, the pupae of large insects continue 
pupae a longer time than those of smaller size. 
Those of beetles and butterflies, for example, 
longer than those of bees and flies. Some species 
remain in this state only two or three days; others, 
as many weeks or months, or even years. The 
period depends on various circumstances, such as 
the season of the year, and the temperature of the 
climate. The same insects will remain pupae as 
long again in our country as they will in India. 
You probably observed that your silk-worms were 
about a month in escaping from their prisons ; in 
their natural climate they would have become 
moths in fifteen davs. 




Emma. 

One thing puzzles me, Papa, and that is, how 
these insects that bury themselves deep in the earth 
or in the heart of trees, manage to find their way 
out of their tombs. 

Mr. B. 

Coleopterous insects, that is, insects of the beetle 
kind, thus circumstanced, wait until their organs 
have acquired sufficient strength and their elytra or 
horny coverings are sufficiently hardened to protect 
their filmy wings from damage in forcing their 
way out. Some are known to be at least a month 
in reaching the surface after quitting the puparium. 
It is evident, however, that no delay would enable 
those without elytrse, such as moths and flies, to 
make their way out without considerable injury. 
Many therefore while still within the hard case of 
the pupa take the precaution, a few days previous 
to leaving it, to wriggle themselves up to the 
surface, or when they reside in the interior of trees, 
to the entrance of their hole. The pupa of the 
great goat moth may often be seen projecting from 
openings in willow trees, and that of the common 
crane fly from the surface of the earth in which 
it has been buried several inches deep. 





Mrs. B. 

It is a singular fact, that the pupae of silk¬ 
worms appear to have a fixed hour of the day for 
disclosing the perfect insect; Frederick, I remem¬ 
ber, constantly found that his broke forth at sun¬ 
rise. 

Mr. B. 

Many besides the silk-worm observe a fixed 
period of the day. The hawk moth of the evening 
primrose comes forth also at sunrise; the hawk 
moth of the lime tree as certainly at noon. But 
the most remarkable insects for punctuality in this 
respect are the ephemerae, so interestingly described 
by Reaumur. “ Myriads of these insects issue in 
clouds from the banks of the Seine somewhere be¬ 
tween the tenth and eighteenth of August. They 
are all disclosed in two or three days, and in¬ 
variably between the hours of eight and ten in the 
evening. The seasons of the different crops are 
not better known by agriculturists, than the time 
when the ephemerae are about to shew themselves 
on the banks of the rivers which they inhabit, is 
by fishermen. Whatever during the day may 
have been the temperature of the atmosphere, the 
hour at which they emerge from the nymph is the 





same with the greater number of them: and 
another hour appears marked beyond which it is 
no longer allowed them to rise to life and gaiety. 

Emma. 

I have often heard of the ephemerae ; what sort 
of insects are they ? 

Mr. B. 

They are elegant fragile little creatures with 
light transparent wings, belonging to the same 
order as the dragon-fly and the ant lion. 

In the larva and nymph state they are aquatic, 
occupying holes in the banks of streams and rivers, 
in which during an existence of two or three 
years they perform the task assigned them by 
their Maker. That task accomplished, they enter 
at the appointed hour, on all the joyousness of 
conscious life. But brief is its duration. At sun¬ 
set they begin to live; before sun-rise the short 
course of most of them is over. 

Mrs. B. 

Short as their life is, it is gaily passed. Their 
choral dances, viewed by the last rays of the 
setting sun, have been described as scarcely 
resembling any thing material. 




Mb. B. 

Allowance must be made for the tints in which 
a poet dips his pencil, when he describes them as 

“Transparent forms, too fine for mortal sight, 

Their fluid bodies half dissolved in light, 

With airy vestments of etherial hue, 

And glittering textures of the filmy dew, 

On whom each beam new transient colour flings, 
Colours that change whene’er they wave their wings/’ 

Still all who have observed them agree that the 
rapid motion of myriads of them performing their 
gyrations round any luminous object cannot be 
witnessed, by the dullest spectator, without as¬ 
tonishment. They completely fill the air like 
thickly falling flakes of snow, and when seen in 
the beams of the declining sun, appear like brilliant 
gems showered down from heaven. 

The fishermen call them manna . When their 
brief life terminates, a very large proportion of 
them fall into the river, affording the fish a grand 
festival, and the fishermen a good harvest. 

But we are a little anticipating our next 
evening’s entertainment; when the structure and 
habits of insects in the imago or perfect state, will 
I hope pleasantly engage our attention. 


FOURTH EVENING. 


Appearance of insects on first quitting the puparium.— 
Principles of the classification of insects.—-Cuvier’s 
system.—-First four orders apterous, or without wings; 
Myriapods, Thysanoura, Parasita, and Suctoria.— 
Eight orders with wings; Coleoptera, Orthoptera, 
Hemiptera, Neuroptera, Lepidoptera, Rhipiptera, and 
Diptera.—Distinctions of sex: females usually the 
larger; some wingless.—Sexes sometimes differ in 
colour; males more ornamented; some have larger 
eyes and antennse; females alone sting; are the more 
industrious and skilful.—Age of insects. 

I hope, Papa, you are at leisure this evening, 
said Emma; for the sight of such numbers of 
insects fluttering and sporting in every direction 
during this beautiful weather, makes me long 
still more to become acquainted with them. 

I have determined, my love, replied Mr. B., 
to defer other engagements as far as possible 
while you are at home, and to make leisure for 
the gratification of my own inclinations, as well 
as of your wishes. 

We will meet in the study and open the cabinet. 




We left our little acquaintance at the point 
when they are first disclosed from the puparium, 
or pupa case. At this moment the insect is soft, 
weak, and languid; its parts are covered with 
moisture, and have so little the appearance 
which they are about to assume, that the unprac¬ 
tised observer can scarcely believe such a change 
possible as that which he is soon to witness. I 
have often, when a boy, watched beetles and 
butterflies emerging to life; and when I have 
seen the elytrse of beetles, for instance, instead of 
being, as I expected, stiff and brilliant, and in 
their proper place upon the back, feebly folded 
over the breast, and of a soft leathery substance, 
and a whitish colour, which exhibited no traces 
of the several tints that were to adorn them, I have 
felt, for the moment, bitter vexation at the apparent 
failure of my hopes. 

Frederick. 

You remind me, Father, of a disappointment 
I once had, when a little boy. I had taken 
great care of a chrysalis all the winter, and 
expected in the spring to see a beautiful butterfly 
make its appearance, with large and gaily-painted 
wings; but to my great mortification, the wings, 





when it came out, for I watched it coming out 
of the pupa, were scarcely bigger than my finger 
nail, and were of such a dull muddy colour, and 
fell so helplessly over the breast, that I thought 
it could never come to anything, so I threw 
it away. 

Mr. B. 

If you had had but a little patience, these 
symptoms of debility and imperfection would 
soon have vanished, and your hopes would have 
been realized by the gradual expansion of the 
wings, and the exhibition of their various lines 
and markings. An hour or two generally suffices 
to give to the insect its proper texture, form, and 
colour. 

Before we proceed to consider insects in their 
imago state, it will be desirable that you should 
have such a general idea of their classification, 
as an inspection of specimens will furnish. 

Emma. 

What does imago mean, Papa ? 

Mr. B. 

It is a term applied to the perfect insect by 
Linne, because having laid aside its mask, and 
thrown off its swaddling bands, it is become a true 
representative or image of its species. 





The classification of insects, like other artificial 
classifications, has been founded by different 
naturalists on various distinctive peculiarities. 

Some have arranged them according to the loca¬ 
lity in which they are found; whether on land or in 
water, on plants or on animals. Others, according 
to the character of their metamorphoses ; and 
others, according to the structure of the mouth; but 
the system now generally adopted is that of Linne, 
who founds it on the variety observable in the 
number and texture of the wings. By the termina¬ 
tion ptera , you will perceive that Cuvier, whose 
plan I have followed, adopted the principle of his 
arrangement.* 

Emma. 

Will you tell me Papa, the exact meaning of 
the word insect ? 

Mr. B. 

It is derived from the Latin insectus , which 
means indented or notched. If you look at a bee 
or a fly, you will at once perceive that its body is 
insected or partially divided into three parts, the 
head, the trunk, and the abdomen. In Greek, 
insects are called entoma for the same reason; and 
hence the study of insects is called entomology . 




Cuvier divides insects into twelve orders, of 
which the first four are apterous or wingless. 

Emma. 

They consist of spiders and such things, I 
suppose. 

Mr. B. 

Xo : on account of various peculiarities in the 
structure of spiders, he places them in a class by 
themselves called arachnidce. 

His first order of windless insects are the 
Myriapods , vulgarly named Millipedes; to this 
belong the various kinds of Scolopendra, Wood- 
lice, &c. 

His second order he names Thysanoura . You 
have seen insects of this order, I dare say; one 
genus of them, the podura or spring-tails, may be 
compared to little silvery fishes ; they run very 
fast, and are to be found in moist places, under 
planks and stones. The sugar louse also belongs 
to it. 

His third order, called Par as it a, is formed of 
those insects that exist on the bodies of other 
animals. As thev are too disgusting to be dwelt 
upon, I shall only remark respecting them, that 
there is no cpiadruped which has not its particular 
louse; and that some nourish several. 





His fourth order of wingless insects, which 
he terms Suctoria , is composed of the different 
species of fleas ; but as they are nearly as unin¬ 
viting as the Parasita , I shall pass them over also 
in silence. 

My collection begins, you perceive, with his 
fifth order, the Coleoptera ,* which comprehends 
the various species of beetles. 

Emma. 

What a great number you have! Papa. 

Mr. B. 

I have some of all the four sections, and of each 
of the twenty families into which Cuvier divides 
the beetle tribes ; but when I tell vou that these 
families are again divided into sixty-eight genera, 
and more than six-hundred sub-genera, you will 
readily believe that I have not specimens of 
one-tenth of the varieties they include. 

The Coleoptera far exceed in number of species 
eveiy other order of insects; for this, and for 
other reasons, among which I might name the 
completeness of the metamorphosis they all under¬ 
go, from a dull heavy worm to a brilliant beetle, 
they have always attracted the particular attention 




of naturalists. Aristotle gave them the name 
Coleoptera because their wings are so strongly 
protected by a sheath; they are, in fact, clothed 
in a complete suit of natural armour. 

This drawer contains the sixth order of Cuvier, 
which are called Orthoptera , from their wings 
being folded in a straight or longitudinal direction. 



Emma. 

You have some very curious looking creatures 
among them. Some of them might yie with 
kangaroos, in the length of their hind-legs;— 
what is this which has fore-legs almost like 
hands ?* 

Mr. B. 

A mole cricket. A creature as mischievous 
in its habits, as it is curious in its appearance. 

A characteristic of this order more marked 
and distinguishing than the form of the wings, 
is that the metamorphosis of insects belonging 
to it is only partial. 

Emma. 

I remember you told me that crickets, locusts, 
grasshoppers, earwigs, and other insects of that 
sort, are equally able to walk and feed in all 
their states. 



Mr. B. 

Yes: the pupa differs from the larva only in 
having the rudiments of wings, which the larva 
has not; and the perfect insect differs from the 
pupa, only in having those wings fully matured. 

The Orthopte?'a , you see, are divided into two 
tribes;—the helpers, such as crickets and grass¬ 
hoppers ; and the runners, such as earwigs. 

This drawer contains specimens of Cuvier’s 
seventh order, the Semiptera,* or those with 
half-cased wings; that is to say, those in which 
only half of the outer wing is homy. They 
terminate the wing-cased insects. In the Semi - 
ptera, however, as in the preceding order, the 
wings are not the most remarkable feature; 
some of them indeed, as the bed-bug, have none 
at all; they are more distinguished from the two 
previous orders, by not having jaws, but mouths 
formed wholly for suction. Among them are 
some disagreeable, and some extremely elegant 
insects. Like the Ortlioptera, the larva and 
pupa very nearly resemble the mature insect 
in form. 




Frederick. 

There are several species of bugs among them, 

I perceive. 

Mr. B. 

Yes: the first division consists almost entirely 

of bugs. In the second, I have several valuable 

specimens of a tribe that have long been famous 

for their musical powers. I mean the Cicadarice 

including the Fulgora , Cicada , Tettix , and 

Tettigonia genera. Some of them, particularly 

the lanthorn-flies, are also remarkably luminous; 

so that this tribe of insects may be said to 

“ Beautify and cheer the night 

With sprightly song and brilliant light/ 7 

The various species of plant-lice also belong to 
this order. 

The eighth order is called Neuroptera* 

Emma. 

How light and pretty their gauze wings are! 

Mr. B. 

We have already noticed the larvae of one or 
two insects belonging to them;—the murderous 
ant-lion, the dragon-fly with his mask, and the 
fragile ephemerae. These are, perhaps, the most 




interesting genera belonging to this order, if we 
except the termites or white ants, of whose remark¬ 
able architectural skill, and equally remarkable 
destructive power, I shall have something to tell 
you another evening. What does Neuroptera 
mean, Frederick? 

Frederick. 

I suppose it means nerve-winged. 

Mr. B. 

You are right. The wings consist of a verv 
 

fine reticulated substance. Many insects of this 
order are carnivorous. Some, as the ant-lion, 
undergo a complete metamorphosis; while in 
others, as the dragon fly, it is incomplete. 

Frederick. 

This drawer contains my favourites, the Syme - 
noptera .* 

Mr. B. 

I quite agree with you in your preference. It 
is indisputably the order most deserving attention. 
Two distinguished naturalists, Mr. Huber and his 
son, spent their lives in observing the manners 
and habits of two of the genera belonging to it : 
the father devoting himself to the study of bees; 
the son, to that of ants. 




The characteristics of the Hyynenoptera are 
four membranous and naked wings, of which the 
upper pair are always the larger; and an auger 
or a sting at the end of the abdomen of the 
female. They all undergo a complete metamor¬ 
phosis, and the nursing and care which some of 
them bestow on the larvae and pupae, is an interest¬ 
ing part of their economy. 

Emma. 

Well, Frederick, you may have the stinging 
bees and wasps to yourself as you like them so 
much; for my paid, I greatly prefer the delicate 
beautiful creatures in this drawer. 

Mr. B. 

The Lep'idoptera * are your favourites, are they ? 
I am afraid, Emma, you are too much influenced 
by appearances. Do you not think intelligence 
and industry preferable to beauty ? 

Emma. 

But, Papa, are not butterflies and moths intelli¬ 
gent and industrious ? Almost all you have vet 
told me of the skill of insects, has been connected 
with them—with their caterpillars at least. 

Mr. B. 

A very good defence, Emma. I must grant 



that in their larva state they are the most interest¬ 
ing order of insects. Popular opinion too seems 
to be in their favour; for no other order, with the 
exception of beetles, has been so generally studied. 
Still, I cannot allow butterflies to be at all equal 
in intelligence to bees and ants. You will be of 
my opinion when you know more of the economy 
of these wonderful little creatures. 

Emma. 

I do not exactly know the distinction between 
butterflies and moths. 

Mr. B. 

There are two or three remarkable points of 
difference. Butterflies when stationarv, hold their 
wings erect, so that you can see only the under 
sides of them ; moths drop theirs in a manner that 
displays their beauty. The antennae of the butter¬ 
fly are very slender, and terminate in a kind of 
knob; those of moths are often elaborately adorned. 

Butterflies fly by day; moths chiefly by twi¬ 
light, and many only by night. 

The. order is called Lepidoptera from the scaly 
or feathery covering of the wings. 

Frederick. 

You have no specimens of Cuvier’s eleventh 
order, the Rhipiptera . 




Mr B. 

The insects belonging to it are few, minute, and 
difficult to obtain. In the larva state they are 
parasitic, living between the segmentary scales of 
wasps and some other insects. 

Emma. 

None of the insects in this drawer, which appear 
to be different kinds of flies, have more than two 
wings, I think. 

Mr. B. 

They are distinguished by that circumstance; 
The twelfth order is called Diptera ,* or two 
winged. 

The Diptera have, however, something instead 
of a second pair of wings. Look at this fly 
which I have put into the microscope; do you 
not see something like a small wire with a ball at 
the end projecting from each side of the trunk 
behind the wings? These little projections are 
called poisers , because some have supposed that 
they enable the fly to balance its body and obviate 
all unsteadiness in flight; others, however, are of 
opinion that they assist respiration; and others, 
with perhaps more probability, that they are only 
the rudiments of wings. 




You have now, I hope, a tolerably correct idea 
of the twelve orders of insects according to Cuvier’s 
classification; the first four, you will bear in mind, 
are apterous , or without wings: and are called 
Myriapoda , Thysanoura , Parasita , and Suctoria . 
Of the eight following orders, all of which have 
wings, three, the Coleoptera , Orthoptera , and 
Hemiptera y have wing-cases; two, the Neuroptera 
and Hymenoptera , have four naked wings; one, 
the Lepidoptera , has four scaly wings; and of the 
two last, the Rliipiptera has two large crossed 
wings, and the Diptera two naked wings, which, 
though comparatively small, are formed for rapid 
flight, 

Emma. 

I see, Papa, that in several instances, you have 
two specimens of apparently the same insect, only 
that the one is smaller than the other; the small 
ones, I suppose, are not full grown. 

Mr. B. 

Another random guess, my young ladv-philoso- 
pher. Insects do not grow after they leave 
the pupa. 

Emma. 

Well now, Papa, you surprise me very much. 
I always thought the small flies, for instance, 





which we sometimes see on the window, were 
young ones, that had not done growing. 

Mr. B. 

Then, my dear girl, you have always been 
under a great mistake. They are an entirely 
different species. With regard to the insects 
in the cabinet, where one is rather smaller than 
the other, they are male and female specimens 
of the same insect. I shall perhaps surprise you 
again when I tell you, that the larger insect is, 
with few exceptions, th e female» 

Emma. 

Indeed! 

Mr. B. 

The disproportion is not, in general, very great; 
yet sufficiently observable for a practised eye to 
determine, even in the larva and pupa states, 
which will become females. There are a few 
instances, however, in which the female is immense¬ 
ly larger than the male. Reaumur tells us of one 
species of beetle, of which the male is so small in 
comparison with his mate, that a bull not larger 
than a hare contrasted with a large cow, would 
aptly represent their proportions. The little 
beetle, he says, has wings and elytrse, while the 





giant female is without either. In some species 
of white ants, (termites) the females are even 
some thousands of times larger than the males. 

The mention of Reaumur’s beetles reminds me 
that the females of some other species are also 
without wings; the common glow-worm, for 
example, (Lampyris noctiluca;) the female 
cock-roach (Blatta;) and the neuters or workers, 
among the ants. 

The sexes sometimes differ also in colour, and 
that, in some instances, so greatly, that they have 
been mistaken for different species. This is very 
often the case in the Hymenoptera; you may 
frequently find males and females among the 
ichneumons and saw-flies that are wholly dis¬ 
similar in colour; and I have here two species 
of wild bees, in the one, (Anthophora retusa,) 
the male is wholly black, and the female wholly 
grey; and in the other, (Osmia coerulescens,) 
the male has, you see, a bronzed, and the female, 
a violet abdomen. 

There are several instances of the same difference 
among the Lepidoptera . In the common brimstone 
butterfly, (Gonepteryx rhamni,) which is one 
of our earliest visitants in spring, the wings of the 





male are yellow, those of the female greenish 
white; and in the common orange-tip butterfly 
(Pontiu cardamines,) one sex has not the orange 
tip to the upper wings. Inattention to this fact 
led even Linn6 into mistakes; his Trojans and 
Greeks are now ascertained to be, in many instances 
at least, only different sexes of the same species. 

Frederick. 

I have often noticed common dragon-flies ( Li - 
bellula depressa) hawking over a pool of water 
in company, in some of which the abdomen was 
of a slate colour, while in others, it was yellow 
with darker side spots. 

Mr. B. 

Those of a slate colour were the males. The 
LibellulidcB are remarkable for the differences of 
colour in the sexes. In one species, (Calepteryx 
virgo ,) the female is green, and her mate, of a 
lovely silky blue. 

Generally speaking, male insects, though in¬ 
ferior to the females in size, and in another 
important particular, which I have yet to mention, 
have a decided advantage with regard to form; 
they have one segment more in the body than 
the female, and some are furnished with various 


defensive appendages : some have one, two, or 
even three threatening horns, either on the head 
or trunk; others have enormous upper jaws. 
In some, the hive-bee for example, the eyes of 
the male are much larger than those of the female : 
while in nearly all, those wonderful organs, whose 
use is little known to us, the antennae, are both 
more complete and more elegant. Look, for 
instance, at these capricorn beetles; the antennas 
of the males are twice the length of those of the 
females. 

Emma. 

Now you mention it, Papa, I remember that 
I have often observed a difference in the antennas 
of gnats. In some, they were thickly fringed with 
hair on each side, like little plumes; and in others, 
quite naked and plain. They are not then two 
different kinds of gnats ? 

Mr. B. 

No : they are the male and female of the same 
species. You never need to be afraid of those 
with the handsomely plumed antennas ; they are 
gentle creatures, content with sipping the nectar 
of flowers. It is the females alone, both among 
gnats (Culices) and horseflies (Tabanidce) whose 
blood-thirsty disposition there is reason to dread. 


Frederick. 

And it is the females only, I think you just 
now said, among the Hymenoptera that wear a 
sting. 

Mr. B. 

Yes: to speak the truth, female insects are 
often of a very unamiable disposition. 

Emma. 

After all this, Papa, it is but fair that you 
should tell us the “ important particular” in 
which as you just now said, female insects are 
superior to the males. 

Mr. B. 

Well then, Emma, it must be confessed that the 
females are very superior in industry. They are 
the workers; and while pleasure is the whole 
pursuit of the other sex, it is on them that the 
care of providing for future generations devolves. 
Look at a hive of bees* While the queen and 
the honey-makers, which are now considered to 
be also females, are skilful and diligent, wise, 
active, prudent, laborious and courageous, the 
males take no part whatever in their cares ; but 
indolently suffer themselves to be maintained at 
the expense of the community, till their idleness 




and cowardice cause them to be expelled from 
the hive. 

Emma. 

Then I do think, Papa, that on the whole, 
though the males may be the prettier and the 
more gentle, the females are by far the most 
deserving of notice. 

Mr. B. 

I think so too, Emma. 

Frederick. 

What is the average term of the life of insects ? 

Mr. B. 

It would perhaps be difficult to say. In some, 
the life is longest in the first states; in others, 
in the last. It may be taken, I think, as a 
pretty general rule, that those, whose existence 
as larvae is the most extended, live for the shortest 
period when they attain maturity; and the reverse. 
Most of the ephemerae, you know, live as larvae 
and pupae two or three years; as perfect insects, only 
an hour or two. The cock-chafer, (Melolontha 
vulgaris ,) which in its first state lives four years, 
as a beetle, lives only eight or ten days; while the 
flesh-fly, whose larva has attained to maturity in 
three or four days, will exist for several weeks. 





A small number of the larger species of insects, 
particularly of the Coleoptera and Orthoptera , 
have been known to live six, nine, twelve, or even 
fifteen months; and a very few, two or three 
years, or even more. Rosel informs us, that he 
kept a rose-beetle (Cetonia aurata) alive for 
three years, by feeding it with fruit and moist 
white bread; and Esper kept one of our most 
common water-beetles (Dytiscus marginalis ) for 
three years and a half, by placing it in a large 
vessel of water, and feeding it with meat. The 
average life of insects, generally speaking, however, 
is but a few weeks; and of many species, but a 
few days or hours. 

And yet, though the very type of frailty, though 
born only to 

.— --Sport in the sunbeam, 

And be seen no more, 

insects are more complex in their formation, that 
is to say, their muscles are far more numerous, 
their nervous system is far more ramified, and 
they are furnished not only with more com- 
plicated, but with a greater variety of organs, 
than the elephant, the rhinoceros, or the hippopo¬ 
tamus ; and all compressed into so minute a bulk. 



as scarcely to counterpoise a ten-millionth part 
of either of those mighty xnonarchs of the forest 
and the flood.* 

To-morrow evening we will examine more 
minutely their astonishing structure, so far at 
least as their external organs are visible to us. 
The microscope will disclose to our view a world 
of wonders.

FIFTH EVENING. 


General form of insects.—Head.—Eyes • simple, con¬ 
glomerate, compound.—Stemmata.—-Hearing.—Anten¬ 
nae the probable organs of hearing; of conversation; of 
detecting changes in the atmosphere.—Touch probably 
resides in the palpi and tarsi.—Smell: organs of smell 
and taste probably in the head.—Insects divided into 
Haustellata , or those that suck, and Mandibulata , or 
those that chew.—Various organs of sucking insects; 
the promuscis of bugs, proboscis of flies and gnats, antlia 
of butterflies.—Jaws of insects differ in construction.— 
Lapping insects.—Insects have no voice. 


We are this evening, said Mr. B., as he took 
his seat at the cabinet, to examine the structure 
of insects, as it is presented to us in their ex¬ 
ternal forms. And first, let us notice in what 
particulars all insects are alike. Some are so 
obvious that you cannot fail to observe them. 

Frederick. 

The bodies of all appear to be divided into 
three partsthe head, the trunk, and the ab¬ 
domen ; and they all, I mean all winged insects, 
have six legs and two antennae. 




Mr. B. 

And all, with the exception of the last two 
orders, have four wings; so that we might define 
an insect as a little creature with six legs, four 
wings, two antennae, and a body divided into 
three distinct parts. 

But though bearing this general resemblance, 
how dissimilar are the different orders! Contrast 
a beetle or a bee with a butterfly, and either of 
these with a grasshopper or a dragon-fly; how 
totally unlike! And yet, take each part sepa¬ 
rately, and you will find, amidst all this variety, 
a strict adherence to one general plan. This you 
will perceive more distinctly by looking at them 
through a microscope. 

We will first examine the part which in all 
animals is the most interesting,—I mean the head. 
I am not going to point out their lips, and temples, 
and cheeks, and noses; you laugh, Emma, but, I 
assure you, grave entomologists do point them 
out; nor shall I pretend to decide which have 
incisor , which laniar , and which molar teeth, or 
whether, like ourselves, any are furnished with 
them all.—This is beyond my ability, as well 
as my purpose. 





The head is usually larger in the perfect insect 
than in the larva; and is supposed to be in insects, 
as in most other animals, the principal seat of the 
senses. Internally, it contains the brain; and 
externally, the mouth, eyes, and antennae. Its 
form is generally that of a triangle, with the angles 
rounded, the point forming the mouth; and its 
substance is harder than the rest of the crust. 

The most remarkable and distinguishing features 
of the head are the eyes and the antennae. Some 
apterous insects, as fleas, lice, spiders, scorpions, 
&c., have from two to sixteen simple eyes, differing 
in shape, colour, size, and situation, and placed 
singly upon the head; others have what are called 
conglomerate eyes, that is to say, simple eyes 
collected together: in the common millepede, 
(lulus terrestris,) there are twenty-eight eyes thus 
placed together in seven rows, and forming a tri¬ 
angle. But the most common kind of eye, at least 
in winged insects, is the compound eye, of which, 
generally speaking, they have two. These eyes 
are composed of a set of transparent crustaceous 
lenses, so hard, as to require no covering to protect 
them, and have thus, like multiplying glasses, 
innumerable surfaces, on every one of which the 


 


object is distinctly formed; so that if a candle be 
held opposite to them, it appears multiplied almost 
to infinity. 

Emma. 

Then they see every single object multiplied to 
an immense number. 

Mr. B. 

0 no : I do not suppose that. You have two 
eyes, but you do not see things double; do you ? 
By the compound structure of their eyes their 
power of vision is strengthened and their field of 
viewed enlarged; without it indeed, as their eyes 
are immoveable, they could have seen but little; 
but some one or other of these minute hemispheres 
being always directed towards objects from what¬ 
ever quarter they present themselves, nothing can 
pass unobserved. These lenses, which amount to 
a greater or less number in the eyes of different 
insects, give to them the appearance of net-work. 
Look at the eye of this fly* in the microscope; it 
appears traversed, you observe, by numberless 
parallel lines, with others, equally numerous, 
intersecting them at right angles, so as apparently 
to form myriads of little partitions each with a 
lens set in it. 




I have here a drawing of a small part of a butter¬ 
fly’s eye, magnified two hundred thousand times,* 
which will give you some idea of the manner in 
which these lenses are set. The sockets, you see, 
are hexagonal, and are fringed with eye lashes; 
the lenses are circular and transparent, convex on 
the outer surface and concave within, but thicker 
in the middle than at the edge. Of these lenses, 
thus curiously formed, and exactly set, no less 
than seventeen thousand three hundred and twenty- 
five have been counted in one eye of a butterfly. 

Frederick. 

I had no idea that they were so immensely 
numerous. 

Mr. B. 

In one genus of beetles, (Dynastes,) they are 
said to be even much more numerous than this: but 
the number varies in different insects. In the eye 
of another species of beetle Mr. Leeuwenhoek 
counted three thousand one hundred and eighty 
one; in that of the common house-fly, eight 
thousand; and in that of a dragon-fly, twelve 
thousand five hundred and forty four. 

Emma. 

I could never have thought that the eye even 

 

of a little insect contained such inconceivable 
wonders. 

Mr B. 

The wisdom of God is displayed, my dear 
Emma, in the minuteness of his works as much 
as in the vastness of them : in the myriads of 
perfect lenses composing the eyes of each of the 
millions of insects that sport in the cheering 
warmth of the summer’s sun, as much as in the 
structure of those suns and worlds with which the 
wide expanse of the universe is filled. 

Frederick. 

You just now mentioned the number of lenses in 
the eye of a dragon-fly;—I think I have read of 
some curious experiments which Mr. Leeuwenhoek 
once made with the eye of one of these insects. 
With the aid of a microscope used as a telescope 
he viewed the steeple of a church through it; he 
could plainly see the spire, though not apparently 
larger than the point of a fine needle: he also 
looked at a house, and could discern the front, 
distinguish the doors and windows, and perceive 
whether they were shut or open. 

Mr. B. 


So he fancied. 





Besides these compound eyes, which from their 
high magnifying powers, are probably intended 
chiefly for surveying more distant objects, a large 
portion of insects are provided with a kind of 
auxiliary eyes, called by Linn6 stemmata; they 
are simple, usually three in number, and placed 
between the other eyes, for the purpose, it is 
thought, of enabling the insect to examine more 
distinctly objects that are near. These organs 
are very conspicuous in the common hive-bee. 

Emma. 

Insects have the sense of sight then in great 
perfection. 

Mr. B. 

And all the other senses. They can not only see, 
but, it is evident, that they can also hear, and touch, 
and taste, and smell; though in what manner, 
that is to say, through the medium of what organs, 
it is not so easy to decide. The remark of Fa- 
bricius, the distinguished Danish naturalist, that 
u nothing in natural history is more abstruse and 
difficult than an accurate description of the senses 
of animals,” is especially true with regard to 
insects. That they possess all the senses, there 
can be little doubt; but where they are placed, 





and how they are exerted, will perhaps ever remain 
matter of enquiry and speculation. 

Frederick. 

Is it certain that they can hear ? 

Mr. B. 

Yes. Some larvae even appear to have the 
power of hearing. Bonnet tells us of a species 
of caterpillar that was moving very swiftly, but 
instantly stopped, and put the anterior part of 
the body into brisk motion, at the sound of a 
small bell. That insects possess this faculty in 
their mature state, is still more strongly confirmed 
by facts. Mr. Kirby says that at brisk and dis¬ 
tinct sounds, he has observed flies to move all 
their legs, and spiders to quit their prey, and 
retire to their hiding places. A very satisfactory 
proof, as Mr. K. remarks, that insects can hear, 
is to be had from those Orthoptera and Uemi- 
ptera , whose males are vocal. Brunelli kept and 
fed in a closet several male grasshoppers, (Acrida 
viridissima,) which continued singing merrily all 
the day; but a rap at the door would stop them 
instantly. By practice, he learned to imitate 
their chirping. When he did this at the door, 
at first a few would answer him in a low note, 




and then the whole party would take up the tune, 
and sing with all their might. He once shut 
up a male in his garden, and gave the female 
her liberty ; but as soon as she heard the male 
chirp, she flew to him immediately. If you wish 
to catch a grasshopper, you must approach very 
gently; it will cease chirping at the sound of 
a footstep, even at some yards distant. Goldsmith 
tells a story of a house being cleared of crickets, 
with which, to the annoyance of the inmates, 
it, had long been infested, by a loud band of 
music at a wedding. 

Emma. 

But where are their ears, Papa ? 

Mr. B. 

That, Emma, as I just now stated, is a question 
more easily asked than answered. It seems pro¬ 
bable, I think, that the antennae answer this 
purpose. They stand out from the head in a 
manner analogous to the ears of vertebrated ani¬ 
mals ; and their number, always two, corresponds 
to them. Some experiments that have been made 
appear also to prove that whatever other purposes 
these wonderful organs may answer, that of hearing 
is at least an important one. Mr. Kirby tells us 





that on making a quiet, not a loud but a distinct 
noise, a little moth, that was reposing upon his 
window, immediately moved towards him the 
antenna that was nearest to him. He repeated 
the noise at least a dozen times, and it was 
followed every time by the same motion of that 
organ; till at length, the insect being alarmed, 
became more agitated and violent in its motions. 

It is very difficult, as I just now remarked, 
even to conjecture on the senses of animals, whose 
perceptions are so much more delicate and keen 
than our own, and appear indeed to commenoe 
where ours terminate. There is little doubt that 

“They hear a sound we cannot hear, 

They see a sign we cannot see 

but how, it is beyond our power to determine. 
As we know, however, that their eyes are ad¬ 
mirably adapted for sight, it is not unreasonable 
to suppose that their antennae may be equally 
well adapted for hearing. Who can tell that 
every joint of some of them at least is not an 
acoustic implement? 

Let us examine these organs a little more 
particularly. You observe that every insect has 
two, and only two antennae; which are placed 





in most cases, in the space between, or a little 
below the eyes, not behind them; and that they 
consist, in general, of a number of tubular joints. 
Though in structure alike, they vary exceedingly 
in size and shape. Some resemble slender threads, 
others are thick and broad; some are very 
long, others remarkably short; some are what 
botanists would call 'pectinate; others, palmate; 
others, serrated . Kirby and Spence describe 
thirty-two different sorts of them, 

Frederick. 

Yes: I perceive they are very various. In 
dragon-flies they are scarcely perceptible; while 
in crickets, they are longer than the body. The 
beetles seem to have the greatest variety of them. 
Why are they called antennce , Father? Antenna 
in Latin means the yard of a ship’s mast. 

Mr. B. 

The name was probably adopted from an idea 
long since exploded, that they are useful to insects 
in flight. Aristotle called them by the scarcely 
more suitable name of horns. The truth is, that 
we know so little of their uses, that it is difficult 
to agree upon an appropriate name. 



M. Huber and his son supposed that, in the 
Hymenoptera order at least, the antennae are the 
organs of conversation, as well as of hearing. 
They tell us of “ the antennal language,” as they 
call it, both of bees and ants. According to them, 
ants have been observed to intimate to their friends 
the approach of danger; to ascertain their 
own party when mingled with the enemy; to 
warn their companions in the interior of the ant 
hill of the presence of the sun; to indicate their 
route in their excursions; to give the signal for 
departure; and even when hungry, to ask of 
others food, by striking those they meet in an 
impressive manner with these organs, the effect 
of which intelligence has been immediately per¬ 
ceptible. 

With regard to bees, the elder Huber made 
some curious experiments, which seem to prove 
this use of the antennae. Wishing to ascertain 
whether, when these sagacious insects have lost 
a queen, (intelligence of which is conveyed through¬ 
out the hive in about an hour,) they discovered 
the sad event by their smell, their touch, or any 
unknown means, he first divided a hive bv a 
grate, which kept the portions about a quarter 



of an inch apart, so they could have no intercourse, 
though scent could pass. In that part in hich 
there was no queen, they were soon in great 
agitation, and in a short time began to construct 
royal cells. He then separated a hive by a par¬ 
tition, through which they could pass their 
antennae, but not their heads. In this case, 
the bees all remained tranquil. To assure them¬ 
selves that their queen was in their vicinity, and 
to communicate with her, they passed their an¬ 
tennae through the openings of the grate, and 
a great number of these organs might be seen 
at once, enquiring as it were in all directions, 
while the queen was observed fastened by her 
feet to the grate, and assiduously replying to 
these solicitous enquiries of her subjects, by 
crossing her antennae with those of the enquirers. 

Emma. 

I wonder what would be the effect of depriving 
an insect of its antennae. 

Mr. B. 

It would become listless and inactive; for 
these remarkable and inexplicable appendages seem 
to be intimately connected with its sentient 
powers. It is probable, that by means of them, 



as Mr. Kirby remarks, they not only receive 
from the atmosphere notices of sounds, but dis¬ 
cover alterations in its state, and foretel, by certain 
prognostics, when a change of weather is approach¬ 
ing. Bees, Mr. K. says, possess this prophetic 
faculty in a wonderful degree. When engaged 
in their daily labours, if a shower is approaching, 
though we can discern no signs of it, they foresee 
it, and return suddenly to their hives. If they 
wander far from home, and do not return till 
late in the evening, it is a prognostic to be de¬ 
pended on that the following day will be fine; 
but if they remain near their habitations, and 
are seen frequently going and returning, although 
no other indications of wet should be discoverable, 
clouds will soon arise, and rain come on. 

Frederick. 

I have sometimes observed that on the approach 
of a tempest, the air is unusually full of insects. 

Mr. B. 

And have you not also observed that before 
the storm comes on, all disappear, and scarcely 
one is to be seen? 

Emma. 

Their antennae then answer the purpose of 
barometers as well as of ears. 



Mr. B. 

So it has been conjectured. But perhaps the 
hairs with which many are thickly covered, 
also assist them in discovering the electric and 
other fluids dispersed in the atmosphere. 

Frederick. 

Are not the antennae their instruments of touch ? 
1 have observed that some keep them in continual 
motion. 

Mr. B. 

They are perhaps in part; but most insects 
are also furnished with palpi or feelers, which, 
as well as their tarsi or paws, appear to be 
employed for this purpose. The palpi are these 
projections near the mouth; they are usually 
four in number, cylindrical, smooth, and ending 
in a softish point. The upper pair, you see, are, 
in most cases, rather longer than the under, so 
that they reach the ground at the same time. 
If you place an insect on your hand, you may 
perceive that it continually applies its palpi to 
feel the surface on which it is moving. When it 
feeds also, it keeps them in constant activity 
upon the substance on which it is feeding. 




Frederick. 

Perhaps then the palpi assists insects in smelling 
and tasting. 

Emma. 

I can scarcely believe that they can smell and 
taste : they often eat such disagreeable things. 

Mr. B. 

Things that are disagreeable to us, Emma; and 
so are the train oil and putrid seahs flesh of the 
Greenlander, and the assafcetida that gives so 
high a gout to the dishes of the Affghans. That 
insects can both taste and smell, is abundantly 
evident from the preferences they shew, and the 
intrusions of which they are guilty. To say 
nothing of the odours which many of them emit, 
what but the sense of smell can attract them to 
our choicest fruits and flowers, and enable them to 
distinguish the grocer’s shop, and thebutcher’s stall? 
However carefully we conceal its favourite viand, 
the insect comes, lured by the scent, and uses 
every effort to gain access to the place from 
whence it emanates. 

Some physiologists have conjectured that the 
sense of smell resides in the palpi; others, in the 
antennae; and others have maintained that, as 




insects breathe through their sides, they must 
needs smell through them too, not considering 
that though we breathe most freely through the 
mouth, the faculty of smell resides only in the 
nose. Mr. Spence thinks that the senses both 
of smell and of taste are seated in the head, 
and perhaps pretty much in the same situation 
that they are in other animals; and an experiment 
which M. Huber made, inclines me to be of the 
same opinion. He applied with a fine hair pencil, 
some oil of turpentine, to tire smell of which bees 
have a particular dislike, to the abdomen, the 
trunk, the eyes, the antennae, and the head of a 
bee, without any effect; but when he pointed 
the pencil near the cavity of the mouth above the 
insertion of the proboscis, the little animal ex¬ 
hibited the most extraordinary agitation. 

Emma. 

Then insects really have noses !—Perhaps they 
have also tongues and palates for tasting. 

Mr. B. 

They have tongues, Emma, certainly; and 
therefore in all probability they are the organs 
of taste. 

The mention of the tongue leads me to make 




a remark or two on the mouths of insects. I have 
before hinted that, in reference to the structure of 
the mouth, insects are divided into two extensive 
groups:—the Haustellata , as they are called, or 
those that take their food by suction; and the 
Mandibulata , or those that bite it. Among the 
Haustellata are the wingless inseets, such as lice and 
fleas, with the Hemiptera , Lepidoptera, and 
Diptera ; or bugs, butterflies, crickets, and flies. 
The Mandibulata include the insects most dis¬ 
tinguished for character and intelligence;—that 
is to say, the Coleoptera, Orihoptera , Neu- 
roptera , and Hymenoptera orders, among which 
are beetles, locusts, dragon-flies, and bees ; though 
as bees never use their jaws for mastication, but 
really lap their food with the tongue, they may 
more properly be denominated tappers. 

I cannot enter into a minute description of the 
varieties observable in either of these divisions. 
In the Hemiptera , the insect has a hollow grooved 
beak, containing four slender threads, which the 
little creature inserts into the substance, whether 
animal or vegetable, on which it feeds, and through 
which it sucks up the juices that form its nutriment. 
Entomologists call this sort of mouth the promuscis. 



When at rest, it is usually laid between the legs. 
You may see it in this bug which I have put into 
the microscope. 

Gnats, horseflies, and other Diptera are provided 
with a proboscis or trunk, on the same general 
plan, but of a more complicated structure, by 
means of which they puncture the skin, and suck 
in the blood. You may easily watch the process 
for yourself, if you will allow one to settle on your 
hand. Some of these have but one lancet; others 
three; the horse-fly has four, and the blood-thirsty 
gnat five: some acutely pointed at the extremity, 
others jagged on one side like a saw. 

Butterflies and moths are still more elegantly 
furnished with a tube, or antlia , as Mr. Kirby 
calls it; in some, not less than three inches long ; 
which is admirably fitted for extracting the honey 
secreted in the nectaries of flowers. This tube, 
when not in use, is coiled up under the head, 
like the spring of a watch. You see it in this 
nettle-butterfly,—with the point of a pin, Emma, 
you may easily unroll it. The antlia , which is 
a cartilaginous substance, apparently composed of 
a series of minute rings, and moved by an equal 




number of distinct muscles, is in fact composed of 
three distinct tubes; two on the sides for the 
reception of air, and one in the centre, through 
which alone the honey is conveyed, formed of 
two separate grooves, which, by a most curious 
apparatus of hooks, like those in the lamina of 
a feather, can either be united into an air-tight 
canal, or instantly separated at the will of the 
insect. I have here a highly-magnified drawing of 
it.* By darting this organ, which the insect has 
the power of instantly unrolling, into the bottom 
of a flower, it draws up through it a supply 
of the delicious nectar. 

Emma. 

How very wonderful ! 

Mr. B. 

It is indeed. How different this trunk from 
the voracious jaws of the larva ! 

Frederick. 

It is remarkable that the instruments of nu¬ 
trition in insects in the larva and perfect states 
should often differ so much. While larvae, I 
suppose, all the Lepidoptera are furnished with 
jaws. 

 


Mr. B. 

Yes: and so are some of the Diptera. 

Frederick. 

Is there much variety in the mouths of those 
insects that masticate their food ? 

Mr. B. 

Yes: their jaws are of very different construc¬ 
tions ; but all, as Mr. Kirby remarks, admirably 
adapted for their intended services. u Some are 
sharp, and armed with spines and branches, for 
tearing flesh ; others are hooked for seizing, and 
at the same time hollow for suction; some are 
calculated like shears for cutting leaves; others, 
more resembling grindstones, are of a strength 
and solidity sufficient to reduce the hardest wood 
to powder.” One singularity attending the major 
part of masticating insects is, that they possess 
in fact two pairs of jaws, an upper and an under 
pair; both opening, as I told you was the case 
in the larva, not vertically as ours do, but hori¬ 
zontally, or from side to side. The upper pair 
are apparently for the seizure and mastication 
of their prey; the under, when hooked, for 
retaining and tearing, while the upper comminute 
it, previously to its being swallowed. 





I have here a front view of a locust’s head,* 
taken so as to exhibit the mouth, which will give 
you a general idea of this construction. 

Emma. 

You said just now, Papa, that bees do not use 
their jaws for mastication;—then of what use are 
they? 

Mr. B. 

They find them very useful as tools in their 
various mechanical arts and labours; to some of 
the Hymenoptera , “they supply the place of 
trowels, spades, and pickaxes; to others, that 
of saws, scissors, and knives,—with many other 
uses.” A piece of honeycomb, or a wasp’s nest, 
will furnish you with ample proof of their utility. 

Would you like to see a bee lap? One has 
just flown in at the window, which we will put 
under a tumbler, placing a drop of water on the 
edge, and with a magnifying glass you may 
readily witness it. Do you not perceive its long 
tongue darted out from the sheath, and already 
employed in quaffing the refreshing beverage ? 

Frederick. 

I was not aware that any insects took water. 



Mr. B. 

To several, particularly bees and ants, it is 
nearly as essential as it is to ourselves, and they 
lap it with great eagerness. Locusts are very 
fond of drink 5 they search with their antennae 
for the dew-drops that hang upon the leav'es, 
and sip them with avidity; many butterflies, and 
moths too, especially in warm climates, are so 
eager for water, that they are chiefly to be taken 
near the margin of drains. Even some larvae 
have been seen to swallow it; there is one species, 
it is said, ( 0denestis potatoria,) that after drink¬ 
ing, lifts up its head like a hen. 

Well, we have spent more than an hour upon 
the tiny insect’s head, and must defer till to¬ 
morrow the examination of the equally interesting 
body and limbs. 

Emma. 

It has been an agreeable hour, Papa, and 
seems to have passed away very quickly. 
Perhaps you will answer just one more question, 
and that is, how such little creatures manage to 
make so much noise, as many of them do. 

Mr. B. 

Not with the voice, Emma, for they have none ; 





that is to say, no insect emits any sound from 
the mouth. 

Frederick. 

Does not the death’s-head moth? I once 
caught one, and as long as I held it in my 
hand, it uttered a strong sharp cry, resembling 
the squeaking of a mouse, only more plaintive. 

Mr. B. 

The sound was not produced by the mouth, 
but by the friction of the palpi against the antlia 
or spiral tongue, which I just now described 
to you. 

Insects of booming or humming flight appear 
to produce the sound by the vibration of their 
wings, occasioned probably by their friction 
against the trunk. If you watch a bee, as she 
passes from flower to flower, you will observe 
that when she alights to collect the nectared 
treasure, the hum ceases, but that it is resumed 
the moment she leaves it, and her wings are 
again in motion. The chirping of the cricket 
tribes is caused by the Auction of the bases of their 
elytra , or wing-cases, against each other. 


SIXTH EVENING. 


Structure of insects continued.—Divisions of the body: 
abdomen, trunk, legs.—Immense strength of insects; 
instanced in locusts, fleas, beetles, &c., and proved by 
their great agility. Linn6’s remark upon it.—Adapt¬ 
ation of the legs of insects to their modes of life.— 
Suckers of the feet of flies.—Insects distinguished by 
the number of joints in their tarsi.—Claws, foot- 
cushions.—-Wings of insects.—Flight of the Coleoplera, 
Orthoptera, Neuroptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, 
and Diptera.—Supposition respecting the employ¬ 
ment of flies.—Speed of their flight.—Covering of the 
wings of insects: of those of the Lepidoptera.—Proofs 
that insects are not endowed with much acuteness of 
feeling.—Modes of catching them.—Proofs that they 
have stated periods of repose analogous to sleep.—Best 
man ner of killing and of setting them. 

Now, Papa, will you open the cabinet again, 
and let us go on with the structure of insects. 
We have had only the head yet, you know: you 
must have a great deal more to tell us. 

Mr. B. 

A great deal more remains to be told, my love, 
than you could possibly understand. I have 
selected, however, a few obvious facts, which 
cannot fail to interest you. 




I pointed out to you in the larva, that the body 
is divided into rings or segments.* The number 
of them, including the head, is usually thirteen. 
In the perfect state, the insect still retains these 
thirteen segments; they are, however, no longer 
all alike, but combined into the separate divisions 
of head, trunk, and abdomen ; the trunk contain¬ 
ing three, and the abdomen nine. 

Of the abdomen, I shall say little. Along the 
sides of it are arranged a principal part of the 
organs of respiration, that is to say, of the spira¬ 
cles or orifices, by means of which, as I before 
told you, insects breathe; it may therefore be 
considered as the chief seat of the vital powers. 
In the majority of insects, it is united to the trunk 
by the whole diameter of its base; but in most of 
the Hyynenoptera , and in some of the Diptera , 
the union is formed by a kind of pedicle or foot¬ 
stalk. As you are familiar with botanical terms, 
I will just say, that this slender pedicle is called 
the petiolus. 

Emma. 

I have observed it in wasps. In some of the 
Hymenoptera you have here, it is long, but in 
others it is very short. 




Mr. B. 

The mechanism of the petiolus, by means of 
which the insect is enabled to lift the heavy 
abdomen, is, according to Mr. Kirby, very wonder¬ 
ful. “ You would be surprised,” he says, “were 
I seriously to assert, that these insects lift their 
weighty posteriors by means of a rope and pulley, 
yet something like this really does take place.” 

The trunk is a still more remarkable part of the 
insect; it is the great centre of motion, and the 
support and prop both of the head and the 
abdomen. 

Frederick. 

It contains I suppose the muscles by which all 
the limbs are moved. 

Mr. B. 

Yes: and if you should ever study entomology 
with the eye of an anatomist, you will be surprised 
at its complex and varied mechanism. 

The trunk or thorax consists, as I have just 
said, of three principal divisions; of which the 
first, or that nearest the head, is usually more 
distinct from the other two, than they are from 
each other. This is sometimes called the mani- 
trunky because the fore-legs, or arms, are attached 





to it. The other two/which in many insects form 
but one piece without any separation, are called 
the alitrunk , because while below they each bear 
a pair of legs, above they bear the organs for 
flight. I have partially dissected a beetle*, (Calo - 
soma sycophantis,) in order to give you a clearer 
idea of these sections:—the first, you perceive, 
bears, as I just now said, the two arms; the 
second, the intermediate legs, and the elytrae or 
primary wings; and the third, the hind legs and 
the secondary wings. 

Emma. 

I never observed that there was any difference 
between the fore legs of insects and their hind ones. 

Mr. B. 

Your observations hitherto, my dear Emma, 
have been of a very superficial character.—Look 
at any of the insects before you, or at the positions 
of any living ones you may happen to meet with, 
and you will perceive that the anterior legs 
uniformly point towards the head. If you observe 
them in motion, you will see that almost all not only 
employ these legs for taking hold of substances, 
but that they also climb by them, something as 




monkeys do. Some use them to seize and despatch 
their prey; and others, the mole cricket for 
example and other burrowing insects, employ 
them for digging. In the mole cricket, you see, 
they are really formed something like hands. Did 
you never notice flies cleaning themselves, how 
busily they rub and wipe the head and trunk with 
these arms ? 

Frederick. 

Moses describes insects as going upon four legs*, 
which seems as if he considered the two front legs 
as you do. 

Mr. B. 

Very well remarked, Frederick : In this case, as 
in numerous others, the inspired penman corrobo¬ 
rates the observations on nature which we make 
in the present day. 

In one respect, the arms and legs of insects are 
alike. They both generally consist of five pieces 
or joints,—the coxa or hip,—the trochanter 
the femur or thigh, which is usually the longest 
and most conspicuous partthe tibia or shank, 
—and the tarsus or foot.

Frederick. 

The coxa or hip is, I suppose, the joint that 
connects the leg with the trunk. 

Mr. B. 

It is; and its form bears a strong resemblance 
to the ball and socket joints by which our limbs 
are united to the body. The trochanter is the 
second joint of the leg, and may be considered 
analogous to what is vulgarly called the kneepan . 

Frederick. 

One thing that strikes me in looking over the 
cabinet is, that the legs of different insects, though 
composed of the same number of parts, are often 
very different in size and conformation. 

Mr. B. 

Adaptation is adistinguishing feature in all the 
works of God. So uniformly is this regarded, 
that from the form of the animal, it is generally easy 
to predicate its habits and modes of life. The 
large thick thighs observable in the hind-legs 
of many beetles, and of all the locust tribes, 
allowing space for the action of powerful muscles, 
indicate them to have great strength of limb for 
running and leaping; while the light and slender 

 


legs of others prove that they are not designed 
for long sustained pedestrian efforts. 

Frederick. 

All the beetles appear to have rather stout 
strong legs when compared with those of some 
other orders. 

Ms. B. 

The Coleoptera are altogether very powerful 
insects; the strength of a cock-chafer has been 
computed to be, bulk for bulk, six times that of a 
horse; and that of some beetles a thousand times 
that of a man. You soon perceive a beetle’s 
strength if you attempt to hold one in your hand. 
I may add, that insects generally in their perfect 
as well as in their larva state, are endowed with 
great muscular power, as their activity sufficiently 
evinces. A locust or a flea will leap two hundred 
times its own length; and Rosel asserts that the 
mole cricket is capable of pushing forward with 
his fore feet on an even surface a weight of six 
pounds. 

Emma. 

I remember, now you mention the strength of 
fleas, reading of one that drew a silver cannon 
supported on two little wheels which weighed 





eighty times as much as itself, and with which 
it ran along with the greatest ease. 

Mr. B. 

Hook tells us something more wonderful still.—* 
An English artist constructed an ivory coach with 


six horses, having a coachman on the box, with a 
dog between his legs, a postillion, two footmen 
behind, and four persons within, which was also 
drawn by a single flea ! 

The agility of insects is also, as I have just 
said, a proof of their immense strength. Not 
only do beetles, those predaceous ones especially, 
which Linn6 has denominated 66 the tigers of the 
insect world ” run with astonishing rapidity, but 
some more minute insects, ants and flies for instance, 
move with inconceivable speed. Mr. Delisle ob¬ 
served a fly, so small as to be almost invisible, 
which ran nearly three inches in a demi-second, 
and in that space made five-hundred and forty 
steps; which is equal to the speed of a man, who 
should run at the far more than railroad pace of 
twenty miles in a minute. 

Frederick. 

It is fortunate for us that animals of large size 
have not been endowed with a muscular power 
proportionable to that of insects. 



Mr. B. 

It is indeed. If the elephant, as Linn6 has 
observed, were strong in proportion to the stag- 
beetle, it would be able to pull up rocks by the 
root, and to level mountains; and were the lion 
and the tiger as strong and swift for their magni¬ 
tude as those tigers among insects, the Cicindela 
and the Cardbus , nothing could have escaped 
them by precaution, or withstood them by strength. 
But to return to the legs of insects.— 

Emma. 

Why have crane-flies such long legs ? 

Mr. B. 

You have heard of the shepherds of Les Landes, 
in the province of Bourdeanx, who, to make their 
way over the deep mire of winter and sands of 
summer, always walk on high stilts;—the long 
legs of these flies answer a similar purpose, and 
enable them to move with ease over and among 
the grass, for the purpose of depositing their eggs. 

If you attentively examine the legs of insects, 
you will see that their adaptations consist not alone 
in their proportions. Look, for example, at the 
hind-legs of this water-beetle, (Dytiscus margi¬ 
nalise) or of this water-boatman (Notonecta,) 





how peculiarly they are fitted for swimming by 
a dense fringe of hair on the shank and foot; 
while those of others, of the stag-beetle (Lucanus) 
for instance, with their jointed tarsi and claws, are 
equally well adapted for walking. 

Emma. 

I have often wondered how flies and other 
insects of that sort manage to stand and walk, 
not only on the window and wall, but even on 
the ceiling, as they do. 

Mr. B. 

They are furnished, my dear, with an apparatus, 
by which they can form a vacuum, so as to adhere 
by atmospheric pressure to the surface on which they 
are moving. You remember that when you laid 
your hand over the tube of the air-pump the other 
day, as soon as the air under it was exhausted, 
the vacuum caused it to adhere to the tubejust in 
the same manner a vacuum which is produced 
under the skinny palms of some insects’ feet, 
enables them to walk or to repose on the ceiling, 
with as much ease as they could do on the floor, 
and with more safety. This highly magnified 
drawing of the foot of a large fly* (Musca vomi - 

 


toria) will give you an idea of this structure. It 
is formed, you see, of “two suckers connected 
with the last joint of the tarsus by a narrow in¬ 
fundibular neck, which has power of motion in 
all directions, immediately under the root of each 
claw. These suckers consist of a membrane capa¬ 
ble of extension and contraction; they are concavo- 
convex, with serrated edges, the concave surface 
being downy, and the convex, granulated. When 
in action, they are separated from each other, and 
the membrane is expanded, so as to increase the sur¬ 
face; by applying this membrane closely to the 
plane of position, the air is sufficiently expelled to 
produce the pressure necessary to keep the animal 
from falling. When the suckers are disengaged, 
they are brought together again, so as to be confined 
within the space between the two claws ” One 
of these large flies has just alighted on the table; 
we will put a tumbler over him, and by the assist¬ 
ance of a common microscope you may see, as he 
moves on the glass, the action of these suckers for 
yourself. It is the fixing of them that produces 
the stinging sensation you sometimes feel,when 

flies alight upon you. 

Emma. 

But when my hand was held down on the 





air-pump, I could not possibly move it; which 
I did not wonder at when you told me that a 
column of air of more than two hundred pounds 
weight was resting on it:—how is it that flies 
do not find the weight of the air an impediment 
to them ? 

Mr. B. 

Do you not remember what we just now said 
about the immense muscular power of insects? 
Flies are far stronger than you, you know. In 
the autumn, however, when the chilly weather 
makes them torpid and feeble, you may observe 
that they move with difficulty, and are scarcely 
able to lift their legs, which seem as if glued to 
the glass,—just as your hand seemed glued to 
the air-pump,—and by degrees, many do actually 
stick till they die on the place. 

Frederick. 

Looking attentively at the feet of insects, I 
perceive that they vary in the number of joints. 

Mr. B. 

They do. Some, and indeed the greater number, 
have jive joints in all their tarsi;-“these are termed 
pentamerous insects : in others, the number of joints 
differs in the different pairs of legs; these are called 




heteromerous insects: in others, all the tarsi con¬ 
sist of four joints; they are said to be tetramerous: 
in others, the lady-bird ( Coccinnella ,) for instance, 
they consist of only three joints; these are called 
trimerous others, that have only two joints, are 
called dimerous ; and the very few that have bat 
one 9 monomerous . 

Frederick. 

I see the arrangement of the Coleoptera de¬ 
pends on this circumstance. 

Mr. B. 

Yes: that class is divided into four sections 
according as the insects belonging to it are pen - 
tcmerousy heteromerous , tetramerous ,or trimerous . 
You observe that th epentamera and the tetramera 9 
those with five joints, and and those with four, 
are by far the most numerous. 

The claws of insects are of too great use to 
them to be passed by unnoticed. It is by means 
of these implements, that the tree-chafer, ( Melo - 
lontha vulgaris ,) the rose-chafer, ( Cetonia aurata ,) 
and other predaceous tribes, ascend the plants and 
trees in pursuit of their prey, and maintain their 
station on the vegetable beauties they are laying 
waste. Look through the microscope at those 





of this beautiful though ferocious insect ( Colo - 
soma sycophanta) which I have dissected, and 
you will judge how useful they must be in enabling 
it to mount the rugged trunk and branches of the 
oak, and to retain its grasp of the leaf or spray, 
of which it has taken hold. See how very acutely 
hooked they are. It is no wonder that it is so 
difficult to detach a beetle from the plant on which 
it is found. These claws, however, prevent their 
walking with equal ease on very smooth surfaces. 
Beetles cannot climb the window as they climb 
a tree; those at least that have no other climbing 
implements than their claws. 

Frederick. 

I have observed some to climb smooth surfaces, 
and even to support themselves against gravity. 
The bloody-nose beetle (Timarcha tenebricosa ) 
can; I have seen it adhere to the under part of 
the trailing plant on which it feeds, with the 
greatest ease. 

Mr. B. 

Many tribes are able to do this; but in this 
case they are furnished with foot cushions , com¬ 
posed of thickly-set hairs, with which the under 
side of the joints of the tarsi are covered. These 




cushions are particularly conspicuous in the Chry - 
somelidcB , a beautiful tribe of plant-beetles. 

Let us now look for a few moments at the wings 
of insects. 

Every wing consists of two transparent mem¬ 
branes, applied to each other. Between these 
membranes lie the veins or nervures , as they 
are termed, that sometimes give to the wings of 
insects a reticulated appearance. These nervures, 
which are most numerous in the wings of those 
insects that are of the most untiring and rapid 
flight, are hollow tubes, that take their origin 
in the trunk, and being furnished with air- 
vessels, which can be filled with air at the 
will of the insect, give tension to the wings, 
and render them buoyant; so that the little 
creatures can soar aloft, join in the choral dance, 
and hum their notes of joy at an elevation in the 
air which is beyond the ken of human vision. 

Emma. 

I should think beetles with their stiff horny 
wings, cannot fly either very high or very fast. 

Mr. B. 

Very few of them can. In regard to flight, the 
Coleoptera are considered the most imperfect of 





four-winged insects; they use their wings indeed 
only upon great emergencies, and as a last re¬ 
source, If you touch, or but attempt to touch, 
a moth, a bee, or a fly, or other winged insect, 
he flies away in a moment; but if you touch a 
a beetle, he either throws himself on his back 
and counterfeits death, or he run3 off with all 
possible speed. It is indeed to the strength of 
his legs, far more than to his wings, that he trusts 
on all occasions. 

The elytrce or stiff 1 horny wings, as you call 
them, are not, however, implements of flight. 
They are only the covers or cases of the wings, 
and in flight are generally motionless. The 
proper wings, which you will find folded up under 
them, are usually very ample, and present in their 
substance, which is generally of a character be¬ 
tween membrane and parchment, and in the large 
nervures that traverse and extend them, that 
appearance of strength for which this class of 
insects is pre-eminently remarkable. Did you 
ever observe a beetle flying ? It maintains a 
nearly vertical position, which gives to the larger 
sorts a very singular appearance. 

Very few people are aware that earwigs {For- 
 


ficula) have wings; but they are furnished with 
very curious, and in proportion to their size, with 
very ample ones. I will endeavour to open one, 
that you may see it. It lies very neatly folded 
up under the little elytra. Its shape, and the 
arrangement of the nervures, give it a fan-like 
appearance. 

Emma. 

Can the other Orthoptera , such as locusts and 
crickets, fly ? 

Mr. B. 

Have you forgotten, my love, that locusts some¬ 
times fly in such clouds as to darken the air? 
House crickets, and also field and mole crickets 
have been observed to fly with an undulating 
motion, like a woodpecker, alternately ascending 
with expanded wings, and descending with folded 
ones; locusts probably fly in the same manner. 

Frederick. 

The Neuroptera seem admirably formed for 
flight. How elegant the wings of these dragon¬ 
flies ( Libellulince ) are; all four nearly of a size, 
and formed of a pure, transparent, glassy membrane, 
closely intersected with nervures like a beautiful 
piece of network, or fine lace. 

 

Mr. B. 

They are insects of very rapid flight, I have 
sometimes been amused to watch a swallow in 
pursuit of one; and to see that, with all his swift- 
ness, he was unable to overtake and entrap it. 
Such indeed is the power of the long wings 
of these insects, and such the force of the mus¬ 
cles that move them, that they seem never to 
be wearied with flying. You may see them 
sailing for hours over a piece of water, sometimes 
to and fro, sometimes wheeling from side to side, 
without ever appearing tired or disposed to alight. 

Another faculty which dragon-flies in common 
with some other insects possess, and which enables 
them still more effectually to elude the pursuit of 
birds, is that of being able to fly in all directions 
without turning. By constantly facing the enemy 
they effectually prevent surprise. 

The Hy menoptera are also insects of active wing. 

Emma. 

Indeed they are. If you offend a wasp or a 
hive of bees, it is no easy matter to escape their 
vengeance. 

Mr. B. 

The peaceful and gentle humble-bees are the 





most powerful fliers among them. If you notice 
them in flight, you will see that they traverse the 
air in segments of a circle, and with a rapidity far 
exceeding in proportion to their size, that of 
any bird. 

Frederick. 

I love to watch butterflies fluttering on their 
broad painted wings from flower to flower, and 
from field to field. 

Mr. B. 

Their fluttering is occasioned by the weight of 
the scales with which their wings are covered. 
The distance to which some Lepidoptera will fly is 
astonishing. The male of one species of silk-worm 
(Attacus paphia) is said sometimes to travel to 
a distance of more than a hundred miles \ and our 
most beautiful butterfly, the purple emperor, (Apa- 
tura iris,) launching into the air from one of the 
highest twigs of some lofty monarch of the forest, 
often mounts to so great a height as to become 
invisible. 

“Above the sovereign oak a sovereign skims, 

The purple emperor, strong in wing and limbs. ” 

Frederick. 

He must indeed be cc strong in wing and limbs, 5 ' 
to be able to soar to such inaccessible heights. 




Mr, B. 

The wings of the Lepidoptera , particularly of the 
larger species, are exceedingly strong, both as to 
nervures and texture. How powerful must be those 
of hawk-moths (Sphinx,) for example, to enable 
them, notwithstanding the weight of their large 
bodies, to sustain such rapid flights ! 

Frederick. 

Hawk-moths fly very differently from butterflies. 
Their course is direct ; when that of butterflies is 
by dipping and rising alternately. 

Mr. B. 

They fly, you remember, in the twilight or by 
night, when birds are asleep; the zigzag course of 
the diurnal Lepidoptera is doubtless designed as a 
means of defence against these predaceous enemies. 
It is very difficult for a bird to catch a butterfly 
on the wing. 

Emma. 

I often watch with interest the aerial progress 
of flies, now dancing up and down, now darting 
first in this direction and then in that, as if in 
pursuit of prey. 

Frederick. 

Do you not think, Father, they really are in 





pursuit of prey ? Mr. Burnett, in his Outlines of 
Botany, states, you know, that the minute seeds 
or sporules of the fungi that produce blights and 
mildews, float about in the atmosphere in count¬ 
less myriads, only waiting for the presence of a 
fitting soil on which to alight and grow; and it 
has occurred to me, that the JDiptera with their 
microscopic eyes may be employed to lessen 
the number of these sporules; they certainly do 
seem, as Emma says, to be darting after prey, 

Mr. B, 

The thought has occurred also to me; but as I 
do not remember to have met with a supposition 
of the kind from any naturalist, I have hardly 
ventured to suggest it. Should it be proved that 
the clouds of flies and gnats that 

“ Sport together in the solar beam , v 
are actually engaged in thinning the ranks of 
those vegetable legions that bring mildew, blight, 
and famine in their train, it will afford additional 
evidence of the wise economy which the God of 
nature exercises in his works. I am certainly 
inclined to think that some of the Diptera are so 
employed: their motions and evolutions have more 
the appearance of business than of sport. 





It is very interesting, as Emma just now 
observed, to watch insects of this order on the 
wing. The gnat (Culex pipiens ) sailing along 
in different directions, upwards, downwards, ob¬ 
liquely, with a motion of the wings so rapid as 
to be imperceptible; the slender crane-fly stretching 
out its arms and hind-legs, the one forming the 
prow and the other the stem of the vessel in its 
voyage through the ocean of air ; and the fly tribes 
(. Muscidce) sometimes remaining for a moment 
stationary, and then darting along with the celerity' 
and directness of an arrow. 

Frederick. 

You have told us the rate of speed at which 
some flies can run, —has that of their flight been 
estimated ? 

Mr. B. 

I have met with a calculation respecting the 
flight of the common fly (Masca domestica .) 
It is said that it usually makes with its wings 
six hundred strokes, which carry it five feet, every’ 
second; but that, if alarmed, its velocity can be 
increased six or seven fold, or to thirty or thirty® 
five feet, in the same period. 




Frederick, 

Astonishing! Why the celebrated race-horse 
Childers, which went at the rate of more than 
a mile in a minute, cleared only ninety feet in 
a second;—this little creature then can actually 
traverse in the same length of time one-third 
the distance of the most rapid race-horse! 

Mr. B. 

Did it equal the race-horse in size, retaining 
its present powers in the ratio of its magnitude, 
it would speed over the globe with the rapidity 
of lightning. 

Another particular to which I intended to direct 
your attention this evening is the clothing of insects, 
especially of the Lepidoptera . 

Frederick. 

I never observed that any others have clothing. 

Mr. B. 

All whose wings are not defended by a case, 
have some protective or ornamental covering. 
Pass your finger over the wing of this dragon-fly, 
do you not perceive that the longitudinal nervures 
are set with very minute bristles, pointing towards 
the extremity? The darkening which you may 
observe in the point of the wing of the humble-bee, 



is occasioned by a large number of hairs which 
seem to spring from a minute tubercle. In the 
common gnat, when the wings have not been 
rubbed, you may perceive that the nervures are 
adorned by a double series of scales, and that 
a fringe of them also ornaments the margin. 

The wings of the Lepidoptera are, however, 
by far the most gorgeously adorned. They are 
covered, as you are aware, with an infinite 
number of minute plumes or scales, so thickly 
planted in their upper and under surface as for 
the most part entirely to conceal the membrane. 
These scales, which at first view resemble dust, 
give to the insect the colours with which it is 
adorned. Scrape a little piece of this nettle- 
butterfly’s wing lightly with a pen-knife and 
put it into the microscope, and you will easily trace 
the lines in which they were planted.* You have 
left, you see, a few on, which will shew you the 
manner of their insertion. I must remark, how¬ 
ever, that though in some species the scales are 
arranged with great regularity, in others they 
are placed without any order. Their number is 
immense. The patient Leeuwenhoek counted 



more than four hundred thousand of them on 
the wings of a silk-worm moth; and in many 
larger species, they must be even far more nu¬ 
merous. I have here outlines of some* highly- 
magnified, by which you may see that they vary 
greatly in form as well as in arrangement. 

Frederick. 

How wonderful that there should be such variety 
in the habiliments, and that so much pains should 
be taken with the attire of even a butterfly ! 

Emma. 

Really, Papa, now I know how wonderfully 
formed and beautifully adorned insects are, I do 
not think I can ever bring myself to destroy 
one again. 

Mr. B. 

I hope, my love, you will never kill one with¬ 
out a sufficient reason ; but you must not indulge 
in undue sentimentalism on this subject. 

Frederick. 

I have often thought that I should like to 
make a collection of insects; but I have felt 
a little as Emma does:—I have not liked to 
kill them. 




Mr. B. 

If they are killed in a proper manner I do 
not apprehend that the mere loss of life occasions 
them pain. 

Frederick. 

You do not think then with our great poet, that 

-“The poor beetle that we tread upon, 

In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great, 

As when a giant dies.”— 

Mr. B, 

No: observations are all against such a sup¬ 
position. The unconcern they manifest at the 
loss of their limbs, sufficiently proves that the 
pain they suffer cannot be very acute. A crane- 
fly (Tipula,) as Mr. Kirby remarks, will leave 
half its legs in the hands of an unlucky boy, who 
has endeavoured to catch it, and will fly here and 
there with as much agility and indifference as if 
nothing had happened; and an insect impaled 
upon a pin will often devour its prey with as 
much avidity as when at liberty. Mr. K. says 
that he has seen the common cock-chafer move 
about with apparent unconcern after some bird 
had nearly emptied its body of the viscera; and 


 

an ant walk when it had lost its head. A 
humble-bee will eat honey greedily, though 
deprived of its abdomen; and the head of a wasp 
will attempt to bite, and the abdomen to sting, 
after separatiou from the rest of the body. These 
facts sufficiently prove that insects do not possess 
that irritability of nerve, and capability of pain, 
which are possessed by higher orders of animals. 

Frederick. 

But there are other difficulties in the way of 
making a collection :—it is difficult to catch insects; 
and when they are caught, it is difficult, to kill 
them without crushing them. 

Mr. B. 

A little adroitness is certainly required to catch 
them. For the Lepidoptera and other flying 
insects, you should have a net, made of gauze or 
coarse muslin, fixed to two rods about four feet 
long, and so contrived, that you can draw it to¬ 
gether in a moment, and secure your captive. 
For catching Diptera and Hymenoptera , when 
they alight on the leaves of plants and flowers, 
a kind of forceps is very useful. You may make 
it of an old pair of curling irons, by fixing to the 
ends octagonal brass hoops about six inches in 





diameter, covered with catgut or green gauze. 
With such an instrument, you may indeed take 
almost any insect that is for a moment stationary. 
The gauze should be sufficiently coarse to admit 
the head of a pin through the interstices, as it is 
sometimes necessary to transfix your victim before 
you attempt to take it out. Many beetles and 
moths may be easily taken, during their season of 
repose, by the hand. You may gather the leaf 
with the moth on, and quickly shut up leaf and 
moth together in a little tin box, with several of 
which you should be provided for the purpose. 

Emma. 

You speak of their season of repose:—do you 
mean that insects are sometimes to be found 
asleep ? 

Mr. B. 

I do not mean to assert that they sleep as we 
do; they cannot shut their eyes, for they have no 
evelids ; but from the fact that at certain intervals 
of the day or night they withdraw for a time 
from activity and observation, it is natural to 
conclude that during those intervals they resign 
themselves to a state of oblivious repose. You may 
indeed often find them in this state \ I have seen 



the cock-chafer which, as you know, flies only in 
the evening, roosting in a tree during the day, 
still and motionless, with his antennae folded to 
the breast; and I have often found moths on the 
north side of the trunk of a tree, perched on 
the lichens, with their wings and antennae folded, 
and themselves without motion, and perfect¬ 
ly insensible of the approach of my hand to 
capture them. Huber states with regard to bees, 
that he has frequently seen them when apparently 
wearied with exertion, even in the middle of the 
day, insert the half of their bodies into an empty 
cell, and remain there, as if taking a nap, for 
half an hour or more. At night, as you may ob¬ 
serve, the whole hive regularly assumes a state 
of sleep-like silence. It seems pretty evident, 
therefore, from these and from other facts that 
might be adduced, that insects have their periods 
of rest analogous, at least, to sleep; and if you 
can discover them during these periods, they may 
very easily be taken. 

Frederick. 

But then the killing , Father;—that seems the 
most difficult part of the affair. Killing them, 
I mean, so as not at all to injure their beauty. 





Mr. B. 

I have generally found immersing them in 
spirits of wine the easiest and most certain plan. 
When you go on your entomological researches, 
vou should take with vou a small wide-mouthed 

v * 

bottle full of this liquid, and as you catch your 
insects, put them in. They will soon be dead; 
and you may put all sorts and sizes together, 
without fear of their devouring each other. 
When you come home, strain your spirits of 
wine through a piece of muslin, return them to 
the bottle for future use, and lay your insects on. 
blotting paper to dry. Spirits of wine, however, 
will not do for the Lepidoptera; you must expose 
them to the action of heat; a low degree of which 
will be sufficient. Those you have in tin boxes, 
you may immerse in a basin of boiling water. 
Another good way of killing some insects that 
you do not wish to wet, is to impale them on a 
piece of elder, or some other soft wood which 
you have fixed tightly at the bottom of a jar ; 
and then, having inverted the jar in a deep basin, 
to pour in boiling water till it is covered; taking 
care, of course, to hold it down, so that the 
expansion of the included air may not overturn 





it. In two minutes or less, the insect will be 
found quite dead, and not at all wetted. 

When you have killed your insects, the next 
thing is to set them. You must have for this 
purpose a thin piece of cork with white paper 
pasted upon it, and some lace-pins of various 
sizes; with one of these pins you must fix each 
insect on the cork, passing your pin through the 
back of butterflies and some others, and through 
the left-hand elytra of beetles, and taking care 
that the legs do not touch the cork. Then, 
with narrow slips of thin card, you must brace 
down the legs, wings, and antennae, in the attitude 
most usually assumed by the living insect. Having 
done this, and taken care to secure your insects 
from the rapacity of earwigs, you must leave them 
for a few days exposed to the air to dry and stiffen. 
Some very small ones you will find it best to 
gum upon card; the attempt to pass a pin through 
them would probably quite destroy their beauty. 

Having completed the setting of your insects, 
and removed the braces, you must place them in 
your cabinet; the drawers and cases of which 
should be about an inch and a half, or two inches 
deep, and covered with glass; and together with 





them put in a little piece of camphor, to preserve 
them from the attacks of mites and other insect 
depredators. I should advise you first to arrange 
your specimens simply with reference to the orders 
to which they belong; as you become more 
practised in distinctions, you will easily separate 
them further according to their respective families, 
genera, subgenera, and species. You will bear in 
mind that by far the most numerous order, amount¬ 
ing to at least one half of the whole insect world, 
is th eColeoptera; and next to this, the Lepi - 
doptera and the Symenoptera . 

Being now in some measure acquainted with 
the physical history of insects, you will follow 
them, I hope, with increased pleasure and inte¬ 
rest into the field, the garden, and the forest, 
to inquire more particularly into the employments 
and social economy of these free-born denizens of 
earth and air. 

Emma. 

You said, I remember, that among insects were 
to be found the first geometricians and architects; 
the first weavers and spinners; the first paper- 
makers and fabricators of diving-bells and air- 
pumps ; indeed, the first practisers of several arts 
of which the invention is the boast of modern times. 




Mr. B. 

As we proceed, I hope to have the pleasure of 
introducing these little mechanics to your notice; 
and of proving to you their claims to precedency 
in the several arts they are found to practise. 


SEVENTH EVENING. 


Spiders :—particulars in which they differ from insects.— 
Remarkable for their ingenuity in capturing their prey.— 
Eyes, legs, mouth.—Not injurious to man.—Spiders 
an article of food.—Their apparatus for swimming.—• 
Mode of weaving of the garden-spider;—of the house- 
spider.—Spiders air-balloonists.—Gossamer webs.— 
Spider-silk.—Trap-door spiders.—Diving spiders. 

I am looking forward with high expectations to 
this evening, Papa, said Emma as she met her 
parents in one of the walks of the shrubbery. 

Mr. B. 

You are thinking of the little primitive artisans 
to which I have engaged to introduce you. 

Well, if it will be agreeable to Mamma, suppose 
we all take our seat in this arbour, and begin our 
evening’s entertainment at once. I see a member 
of one of the most skilful of the insect tribes, 
watching the web which he has woven between 
the boughs of the clematis: I do not know that 
we could have a better subject. 

Emma. 

But I thought, Papa, you did not reckon 
spiders among insects. 




Mr. B. 

They differ in so many particulars from other 
insects that naturalists have placed them, with 
some others, in a class by themselves, called, as I 
have told you, Arachnidce; but still, they have 
so many points of resemblance to insects in 
general, as well as connection with them, that no 
account of the insect world can be considered 
complete which does not include them. 

Frederick. 

In what particulars do spiders differ so much 
from other insects, Father ? 

Mr. B. 

Insects, you know, have no circulation of fluids: 
spiders have; their heart and blood-vessels are 
clearly perceptible; and in consequence they do 
not breathe through spiracles in the sides as insects 
do, but have organs that answer the purpose of 
lungs. In insects, the head is united to the body 
by means of slender threads : in spiders it is joined 
immediately to it. Insects, all hexapod insects 
at 'least, have two compound eyes: spiders have 
simple eyes more resembling the organs of vision 
in the higher orders of animals. Insects have 
only six legs: spiders when they have attained 




to maturity have eight. Spiders also have no 
antennce which, as you know, form an important 
part of the insect’s structure. 

The natural history of spiders is highly interest¬ 
ing, not only with regard to their physiology, 
but also to the wonderful instincts displayed by 
the different species in the construction of their 
webs, and the surprise and destruction of their 
victims. No sagacity exhibited by the higher 
orders of animals, not excepting even that of the 
“ half-reasoning beaver,” is at all equal to the skill 
displayed by spiders in forming their habita¬ 
tions and capturing their prey. Some bore 
tunnels for themselves in wood, earth, or any 
other penetrable substance, lining them with a 
silken tapestry of most beautiful texture adapted 
to resist humidity, and actually guarding the 
entrance by a trap-door. Others, of which we 
have a specimen before us, make large nets of the 
most regular conformation and curious fabric, 



near which the little fowler lies completely hidden 
from view, “ making semblance, ” as a quaint 
writer remarks, u as though he meant nothing less 
than that he doth, and as if he went about some 
other business! nay, so close lieth he, that it is 





Impossible to see whether any one be within or 
no/ ? until warned of the neighbourhood of his 
game by a line passing from the centre of the web 
to his place of concealment, he darts forth and 
attacks the unfortunate victim entangled in his toils. 
Others, that may be termed hunters , neither 
dig dens nor form nets; but conceal them¬ 
selves within a flower or a rolled-up leaf, or 
behind a stone, and dart upon any insect that 
chances to pass; while others employ various 
stratagems to decoy their victims, such as pretend¬ 
ing to be dead; and others, possessing peculiar 
agility, openly search after and seize their prey, 
springing upon it with the precision and ferocity 
of a tiger. One of these has been seen to spring 
upon a humble bee at a distance of two feet. 

Mrs. B. 

Spiders appear to be to the insect world, what 
beasts of prey are to quadrupeds. 

Mr. B. 

They very much resemble them. They are 
equally solitary and ferocious in their habits; like 
them they live entirely by prey, and like them too 
they hunt chiefly by night. 

I have a good magnifying glass in my pocket; 




and while this spider is quietly watching his web, 
we will examine him through it. 

Emma. 

How beautiful his skin appears ! it looks like a 
hard polished crust. 

Mr. B. 

You perceive that he has eight eyes on the top 
of the head. This number of eyes is common 
with few exceptions to all spiders; but they are 
differently placed in the different species. In 
some, they lie in two rows; in others, they form 
two sides of an angle; indeed, they assume every 
imaginable difference of position. It is chiefly by 
the arrangement of the eyes that the different 
species are distinguished. 

Emma. 

Are there many different species ? 

Mr. B. 

Naturalists have enumerated upwards of fifty. 

Frederick. 

Do spiders undergo any essential change in 
their progress to maturity ? 

Mr. B. 

Yes, in common with all articulated animals, 
they cast the outer skin several times and at stated 





periods ; and in the earlier stages of their existence 
they have a smaller number of legs: the last pair 
do not make their appearance until the spider has 
attained a certain size. 

I was going to shew you this spider’s mouth. 
It is furnished with two fangs, each terminating 
in a sharp talon, which stand out horizontally, and 
when not in use, are concealed in two cases 
contrived for their reception, into which they fold 
like a clasp knife. Each fang has at the point a 
a minute aperture, through which, when the victim 
is lacerated, a poisonous fluid is emitted that 
quickly dispatches it. 

Frederick. 

His legs also seem admirably well adapted for 
sanguinary encounters. 

Mr. B. 

They have each, you see, three joints, and 
terminate in two crooked claws, with a smaller one, 
something like a spur, between them. Every 
thing, indeed, in the structure of spiders points 
them out to be most ferocious little animals; and 
their habits do not contradict the inference we 
draw from their appearance. They attack and 
devour not only other insects, but each other; 




and that without mercy. Even the female does 
not spare her mate, unless he speedily make his 
escape out of her clutches. 

Emma. 

Then, Papa, it is not without reason that 
people are afraid of spiders. 

Mr. B. 

You mean, Emma, that insects are afraid of 
them. I never heard of a spider, however 
fierce and treacherous, killing and eating a man. 
They take pretty good care not to come near 
enough to do us any injury, even if they had 
the power to do it. If you approach one, and 
he is aware of you, he will run off as fast as he 
can 5 and if he find he cannot otherwise escape, 
he will fall down, curl up his legs, and assume 
the appearance of death. Depend upon it, a 
spider will never engage in the unequal warfare. 

Frederick. 

Do you mean to say, Father, that spiders never 
injure us ? 

Mr. B, 

I do not mean positively to say that; there may 
be, and probably there are, in warm countries, 
individual species whose bite is poisonous, but in 




very few, I apprehend, to a fatal extent. With 
regard to those in our latitude, M. Kollar, the 
distinguished German entomologist, says, that 
he had caught in his hand most of the native 
species without receiving the least injury from 
them; and that he had once been bitten by one, 
but that the bite produced no inflammation, and 
the pain of it passed away without the application 
of any remedy. Spiders, like other creatures, 
when persecuted and captured, will of course 
bite to defend themselves. 

Frederick. 

Is not the bite of the tarantula frequently fatal ? 

Mr. B. 

O ! no. Sad tales are related of its death¬ 
dealing powers; but it is now pretty clearly 
proved that these pretended effects were a long 
practised cheat put upon credulous travellers. 

There is, I believe, a species of spider found 
in Popayan, of a fiery red colour, called by the 
natives Coy a, the juices of whose body when 
crushed, are extremely venomous; but these 
spiders, like our own, are perfectly harmless 
while living. The Indians are wisely careful 
not to crush them. 


 

I have read of a woman being much injured 
by the juices of spiders in our own country; but 
then the silly cruel creature had only herself to 
thank for it. It was her custom, every time 
she went into the cellar with a candle, to bum all 
the cobwebs and spiders she could see. She had 
often felt dizzy and faint from the smell of the 
burning spiders, but nothing could cure her 
inhumanity till one day the legs of one of her 
unfortunate victims happening to stick in the 
candle, so that it could not disengage itself, the 
body burst in the flame; and the contents of it 
being thrown upon her eyes and lips, caused 
such swelling and inflammation that it was 
several weeks before she recovered. 

Frederick. 

The stupid old woman was rightly served. 

Mrs. B. 

The dislike many people feel to spiders lies, 
I am persuaded, rather in prejudice than in any 
conviction of their disposition to hurt us. For 
my own part, I have been so long in the habit 
of admiring the skill, the patience, and the per¬ 
severing industry of these so generally-hated little 





creatures, that a spider is to me an attractive 
rather than a repulsive object, 

Frederick. 

How should you like to eat spiders, Emma ? 

Emma. 

O Frederick! how can vou mention such a 



thing! 

Frederick. 

Some people eat them, I assure you. Labil- 
lardiere tells us, that there is a spider in New 
Caledonia, nearly an inch long, which the in¬ 
habitants collect in large quantities, roast over 
the fire, and eat with great relish. Some of the 
inhabitants of South Africa also reckon spiders 
among their dainties. 

Emma. 

Spiders may be very suitable dainties for the 
inhabitants of New Caledonia and the savage 
Bushmen. They will eat anything. 

Mr. B. 



Spiders have been considered dainties, Emma, 
even in civilized life, and among literary persons. 
That female of singular talents, the celebrated 
Anna Maria Schurrman, used to eat them like 
nuts ) which she said they very much resembled 





in taste: and Reaumur tells us of another young; 
lady who could never resist the temptation of 
such a bon bon as a garden-spider. Lalande, the 
French astronomer, was also very fond of their 
flavour; and Rosel mentions a German who 
used to spread them on his bread like butter.— 
But enough of spider-eating; we will turn to 
some more agreeable subject. 

The apparatus for spinning, with which spiders 
are furnished, is a curious part of their mechanism. 
It consists of four or six little tubercles at the end 
of the abdomen, each of which contains a multi¬ 
tude of tubes, so numerous and so exquisitely fine, 
that a space, often not bigger than the point of a 
pin, is furnished, according to Reaumur, with a 
thousand of them. From each of these minute 
tubes the spider emits a glutinous silky thread 
of inconceivable tenuity; the threads from them 
all uniting together, form that which they employ 
employ in weaving their webs. 

Emma. 

Then each spider’s thread that is visible to us 
is formed of four or perhaps six thousand others! 

Mr. B. 

Yes: even those of the smallest species, some 




of which, you know, are so fine as to be almost 
imperceptible to us, are in reality ropes, composed 
of at least four thousand strands. 

Emma. 

And these complicated threads are not after 
all so thick as a hair! 

Mr. B. 

So thick as a hair! my dear;—a thousand of 
them would scarcely form one so thick as a hair of 
your head. 

The manner in which spiders employ this thread 
is, as I just now said, a sufficient proof that they 
possess superior instinctive intelligence. 

When the spider begins to form his web, (I 
speak now more particularly of the garden-spider, 
JEpeira diadema , because we have one before 
us,) he first fixes the end of his thread by apply¬ 
ing his spinners to anything that happens to be 
convenient; and the thread lengthening in pro¬ 
portion as he recedes from the point where he 
had fixed it, he fastens it again to something on 
the opposite side. In this way he forms the 
margin of his net, which he takes special care 
to render strong by gluing several threads together. 
The construction of this margin appears to be the 
most important and difficult part of the operation; 




when tMs is done, he quickly crosses the area he 
has described by the radiating lines, which give 
it a wheel-like appearance. These radii, which 
are generally about twenty in number, being 
finished, he goes to the centre, and tests their 
strength by pulling eaph thread with his feet; 
if any appear weak or defective, he breaks them, 
and supplies their place with others. 

Having thus formed the foundation of his web, 
he attaches around the centre five or six small 
concentric circles; and then, at greater distances, 
four or five larger ones, which are intended 
to serve as a sort of temporary scaffolding, 
and also to keep the radii properly stretched, 
while he glues to them the viscid threads intended 
to ensnare his victims. This done, he runs again 
to the centre, bites away the small cotton-like 
tuft that unites the radii, and in the circular 
opening thus produced, takes his station, and 
watches for his prey. 

Dryden beautifully describes his proceedings 

when his web is finished. 
The treacherous spider, when his nets are spread. 
Deep ambushed in his silent den doth lie, 

And feels, far off, the trembling of his thread, 

Whose filmy cord should bind the struggling fly; 




Then, if at last he find him fast beset, 

He issues forth, and runs along his loom, 

Eager to seize the captive in his net, \ 

And drag the little wretch in triumph home.” 

Frederick. 

The formation of his net must be a long process. 

Mr. B. 

No, it is not; indeed it cannot be; for when 
it is not destroyed by any accident, such as some 
great unmanageable insect perversely entangling 
itself in the threads, he renews it partially, if not 
entirely, every twenty-four hours; for the circles 
more especially designed to catch his prey, are 
composed of a peculiarly viscid material, which, 
when long exposed to the air, dries and loses its 
adhesive property. 

Emma. 

But I have seen what appeared to me the same 
cobweb hanging for months in the same place. 

Mr. B. 

Very likely you have. The web of the house- 
spider, which is a gauze-like substance, formed 
to entrap the claws of flies in its fine meshes, 
will serve, with occasional repairs, for a con* 
siderable period. 



Do you know, I expect a continuance of fine 
weather from the appearance of this spider’s web. 

Mrs. B. 

What do you judge from ? 

Mr. B. 

From the great length of the main threads which 
support it. Spiders are very dependant for success 
on weather; the web of many an one is destroyed 
by a storm of wind or a heavy shower, and as 
long as rain or wind continues, they must fast, 
though it be for weeks or months, for the web 
cannot be renewed. Availing themselves, there¬ 
fore, of every possible precaution against the 
destruction of their webs, it has been observed 
that if the weather is about to be changeable, wet, 
or stormy, they make the foundation threads short, 
that they may not so easily be broken; but that 
if fine settled weather be on the point of commenc¬ 
ing, they venture to extend their toils by making 
these threads long. 

Frederick. 

I have often wondered how they spin those 
long threads; I mean how they contrive to get 
across with the first thread; for the point to 
which they ultimately fasten it is often a very 





long way, sometimes a yard or more, from that 
where they begun. There is nothing for them 
to walk on, and they cannot fly. 

Mr. B. 

Spiders appear to have the power of darting 
their threads before them in any direction, and 
to almost any extent they please. Having fixed 
the thread, therefore, at one point, they throw 
it out towards some other, where they design to 
fasten it, judging, we know not how, of its 
position and distance. 

Mrs. B. 

And they have, I believe, the power of throw¬ 
ing out their threads not only in a horizontal 
direction, but up into the air; in fact, of forming 
for themselves air-balloons of them. 

Mr. B. 

Yes: the invention of Montgolfier has always 
been in the possession of spiders. Naturalists, 
who have paid attention to this interesting fact, 
have observed that when a spider purposes 
an aerial excursion, he throws himself upon 
his back, darts out a long thread, and vaults 
from the place on which he stood. As he ascends, 
he pulls in his thread with his fore-feet, so as to 



form it into a ball of flake, and thus increasing his 
surface without increasing his gravity, he some¬ 
times soars away to a prodigous elevation. Dr. 
Martin Lister, a curious observer of these little 
animals, states that he once saw from the top 
of the highest steeple of York Minster, numbers 
of these webs floating still very high above him. 

Frederick. 

Is this faculty common to all spiders, or only 
to some particular species ? 

Mr. B. 

It does not appear to be confined to any one 
species. It is only, however, in their young 
or half-grown state that they have been observed 
to make these aeronautical expeditions; from 
whence we may infer that when full grown, their 
bodies are too large and heavy. 

The fleecy webs thus spun in the air, as well 
as those we sometimes see in fine autumnal morn¬ 
ings spread in such profusion over fields of stubble, 
form what in our country are called gossamer webs; 
the French call them fils de la merge; and the 
Germans, from their constantly appearing in the 
autumn, der jliegender sommer , the flying or 
departing summer. 




Emma. 

I suppose the material of which spiders form 
their threads is of the same nature as the silk spun 
by the silk-worm and other caterpillars. 

Mr. B. 

Yes, it is; and a Frenchman once speculated 
on the possibility of employing it to a useful 
purpose. He contrived to manufacture from the 
bags or cones which the female spins for the 
reception of her eggs, (and which you have often 
seen, I dare say, like little yellow silken balls 
safely fixed in secure corners,) a pair of silk 
stockings and mittens. But he found it would be 
impossible to carry on the manufacture to any 
extent; for the work of twelve spiders is not equal 
to more than that of one silk-worm; and their 
ferocity is so great that they cannot be prevented 
from destroying one another. 

Mrs. B. 

I have heard that the spiders of the Bermudas 
spin webs between trees forty or fifty feet distant, 
and strong enough to ensnare a bird as large 
as a thrush. 

Mr. B. 

Where large insects are to be caught, there the 





spider is instructed to form his web of corresponding 
size and strength. Sir G. Staunton informs 
us, that in the forests of Java also, spiders 1 webs 
are to be found so remarkably thick and tena¬ 
cious as to require a sharp knife to divide them. 

Emma. 

I think, you said, Papa, that there are some 
spiders that do not spin webs. 

Mr. B. 

Many species do not; but devote their silken 
stores chiefly to the service of their young. All 
spiders lay their eggs carefully in silken cones; 
for they are tender, affectionate parents. 

Among those spiders that do not spin webs, 
two species are especially deserving to be placed 
among our primitive mechanics;—the trap-door 
spiders, as they are called, and the fabricators 
of the diving-bell . 

Emma. 

I was wishing to ask you, Papa, about the 
den and the trap-door you mentioned. 

Mr. B. 

There are, I believe, two or three varieties 
of the trap-door spider. That whose habitation 
I have seen, (Cteniza ecementaria 9 ) is found in 





the south of France. This sagacious little creature 
first digs by means of his strong jaws, a cylindrical 
gallery or tunnel, upwards of two feet long and 
about half an inch in diameter; selecting for 
the purpose a steep bank of bare clay from which 
the rain will readily run off. Having excavated 
the tunnel, he lines it throughout with a web of 
fine silk; this serves the double purpose of 
strengthening the walls and of forming such a 
communication with the door as may inform him 
of what is passing above. 

Emma. 

The door is what I am particularly curious to 
hear about.—You do not mean a real door, Papa, 
do you ? 

Mr. B. 

Yes, my dear: I do. This spider forms a real 
door; not of wood, but of several layers of clay or 
chalk cemented together with silk. When finished 
it is as perfectly circular as if it were traced with 
compasses; and fits so nicely into the aperture of 
the cell, that the casual observer cannot distinguish 
it from the surrounding earth. But the most 
marvellous circumstance is, that the clever little 
architect actually fixes it to the entrance by a hinge 





of silk; and as if acquainted with mechanical 
laws, invariably places the hinge at the highest 
side of the opening; so that the door, which is 
easily pushed open by^the spider from within, 
shuts again by its own weight; and there being a 
little edge, or groove, to receive it, it closes with 
such precision, that, as I said, it seems to make 
one surface with the earth in which it is formed. 
If any attempt be made from without to open it, 
the courageous little inhabitant, warned by the 
vibration of the threads which extend to the bottom 
of the gallery, runs to it with all speed, and 
fastening: his claws on one side to the door and on 
the other to the walls of his den, pulls with all 
his might against the intruder. 

Thus skilfully formed and defended, this curious 
subterrean furnishes a secure habitation for the 
spider and his family; which usually consists of 
his mate and twenty or thirty young ones. At 
night, they prowl about in search of prey; chiefly 
beetles; which they drag into their den and devour. 
The bottom of it is usually strewed with the 
remains of various coleopterous insects. 

The fabricator of the diving belly (Argyroneta 
aquatica) is a water-spider, and one of the largest 
of the spider-race. 





Emma. 

That I suppose was the insect you alluded to as 
the first employer of a diving-bell. But how is it 
possible, Papa, for the little creature to form such 
a machine and to lower it into the water ? 

Mr. B. 

She does not first form it and then lower it into 
the water, Emma: I did not mean to say that. 
She does what would puzzle our engineers far 
more; she actually builds it in the water. She 
first forms the frame-work of loose threads attached, 
to the leaves of aquatic plants. These threads 
she varnishes over with a glutinous transparent 
secretion resembling liquid glass, and so elastic as 
to admit of considerable distension and contraction. 
Having thus formed the bell , she spreads over her 
body a pellicle of the same secretion; and ascending 
to the surface, obtains, though in what manner is 
not exactly known, a bubble of air. Surrounded 
with this aerial mantle, which to the spectator 
seems formed of brilliant quicksilver, she plunges 
to the bottom, and introduces the bubble of air 
beneath the roof of her habitation. This process 
she repeats ten or twelve times; till, in about a 
quarter of an hour, having conveyed as much 





air as suffices to extend her dwelling to its pro¬ 
posed dimensions, she finds herself in possession 
of a little aerial edifice formed in the very midst 
of the waters. Here she dwells : and from this 
curious chamber, which is about the size and 
shape of half a pigeon’s egg, she issues forth, 
searching sometimes the water, and sometimes 
the land, for prey; which, when obtained, is 
transported to this submarine mansion, and de¬ 
voured at leisure. Both sexes form these lodgings ; 
but early in the spring, the male quits his own 
and seeks that of the female, which being enlarged 
by a bubble of air that he brought with him, 
becomes the abode of the happy pair, and a safe 
depository for their eggs; treasures which are pack¬ 
ed up in a silken cocoon in one corner of their dwell¬ 
ing and carefully watched over by the mother. 
This spider, in some countries, is not uncommon 
in stagnant pools. 

But the dews of evening are beginning to fall, 
and to remind us that it is time to return to 
the house. 

I shall henceforth look at spiders with feelings 
very different from those I used to have, said 
Emma, as they arose to leave the arbour# I see 




now the force and beauty of Solomon’s remark, 
that u though little upon earth, they are exceed¬ 
ing wise.” 

And exceedingly useful too, rejoined Mr. B. 
We owe much to their exertions, and ought to 
regard them with complacency and pleasure.

I have been thinking Papa, said Emma, in 
connection with our late agreeable evenings, how 
much enjoyment we lose through ignorance. I 
never before this vacation looked at insects with 
any thing like interest; now it is always a real 
treat to me to watch one. 

Mr. B. 

Your remark, my dear Emma, is just. The 
volume of nature presents in varied profusion 
much that is curious, instructive, and beautiful; 
but we must learn to read it before we can derive 
the pleasure it is designed to yield. When, 
however, we are even in a small degree acquainted 
with its contents, we find that objects apparently 
the most trivial, a mere stone, a humble weed, or 
a busy insect, will often suggest trains of delightful 
contemplation, and afford us enjoyment of the 
purest kind. On the ground of pleasure, 
therefore, apart from the immediate benefit 
connected with a knowledge of the structure and 
properties of the objects by which we are surround- 





ed, I advise all young persons to cultivate an 
intimate and practical acquaintance with the works 
of God. As our favorite poet says :— 

“Tis sweet to muse upon His skill display’d 
(Infinite skill) in all that he has made! 

To trace, in Nature’s most minute design, 

The signature and stamp of powder divine.” 

We are now to enter a little more at large on 
the general history of insects. First, we shall 
consider them in relation to other parts of nature, 
and especially to ourselves; and then we shall 
take a glance at their habitations and social 
economy, which will include their modes of defence, 
their luminous and musical powers, and various 
other interesting and amusing particulars. 

Emma. 

Really, Papa, you make me smile : I should 
almost think you were speaking of rational beings, 

Mr. B. 

Several of the facts to which I shall refer will 
convince you that, as I have before remarked, the 
instinctive sagacity displayed by many insects 
more nearly resembles reason than that of most 
other irrational animals. Solomon, whose deep 
and comprehensive mind grasped the whole crea« 





tion, and accurately discerned the place and proper¬ 
ties of all its various parts, repeatedly sends us, 
you know, to the insect world to learn wisdom . 

As it is chiefly in providing for themselves or 
their young that this sagacity is manifested, we 
will look, in the first place, at their food; in their 
pursuit of which, their relation to other departments 
of nature, and to ourselves, is principally exhibited. 

Frederick. 

I know by experience that they are sagacious 
enough about food. I am generally quite puzzled 
to feed those I find, if I do not happen to discover 
them on the identical substance they prefer. 
Many will die of starvation rather than eat what 
I give them. 

Emma. 

What is become of the glow-worms you brought 
home the other night, Frederick ? 

Frederick. 

I rather think they are all dead. They would 
not touch any of the leaves I offered them. 

Mr. B. 

You should have given them some snails or 
slugs. Carnivorous insects will not eat leaves 
any more than carnivorous beasts. 




In the choice of food, insects have a much more 
extensive variety open to them than any other class 
of animals, perhaps I might say, than all other 
classes together; for their immense strength and 
aodlitv, combined with the minuteness of their 
forms, enable them to force their way into almost 
every substance, and to feast at pleasure on things 
inaccessible to all besides. The whole organic 
creation may indeed be considered as a stupendous 
table, at which the insect world sit down as guests, 
and at which no viand is left untasted by some 
or other of the numerous company. 

Some of these guests are exclusively vegetable 
eaters; others confine themselves to animal sub¬ 
stances ; while a very great number live at one 
period of their existence on animal, and at another, 
on vegetable diet; and a few will eat anything 
that comes in their way. Among all these classes, 
some prefer their food in a dead, and even in a 
decayed state; and others will eat it only when 
alive or fresh: some can live only on one kind 
of plant or animal, while others, and that a 
large proportion of species, are able to subsist on 
several kinds. 

Of phytiphagous insects, or those that feed on 




vegetables, very few, even of those that are not 
confined to one particular species, eat of all plants 
indiscriminately, or of all the parts of the same 
plant. Those that live under ground, among 
which are the larvae of several of the beetle tribes, 
find the roots most accessible, as well as most 
to their taste. Others prefer the stem and branches. 
A third division, more open in their depredations, 
live exclusively on the leaves. A fourth select 
the flowers. While a fifth choose the more sub¬ 
stantial fruit or seed. Even among each of these 
a still further selection takes place. 

Of those that feed on the roots, or stem and 
branches, some, as the bee-hawkmoth, (Sphinx 
epiformis,) eat only the rind; others, only the 
inner bark and alburnum; a third, and still larger 
party, consisting of the stag-beetle tribes, (Luca - 
nidcBy) some of the weevils, the capricorn-beetles, 
(CerambycidcBy) and the only larva among the 
Lepidoptera that feeds on wood, the great goat- 
moth, (hence called Cossus ligniperda,) with 
a few others, penetrate even into the solid heart 
of the tree. 

Of those that choose the leaves, the various 
kinds of Aphides , or plant-lice, take only the juice 





from the veins; the mining caterpillars only the 
parenchyma or fleshy substance between the 
cuticles: I dare say you have often seen the 
leaves ofthe bramble, the dandelion, and other 
plants, thus excavated, and looking almost as if 
they had been tatooed: many of the leaf-rolling 
caterpillars take only the lower surface of the leaf; 
while the more rapacious larvae of most lepidop- 
terous insects greedilv devour it entire. 

Among those whose more delicate taste leads 
them to prefer the flowers, some, as the mullein 
moth, select the petals ; others, as the rose-chafers, 
&c., the farina in a perfect state; bees also collect 
the farma to make of it bee-bread for themselves 
and their young; and a still greater number, among 
which are wasps and flies, with most butterflies 
and moths, revel on the honey in the nectaries. I 
need not add that from this bees elaborate their 
delicious stores. 

Mrs. B. 

We cannot fail to admire the wise economy 
that thus regulates the preferences of insects. 
Had all eaten exclusively of the roots, of the stem 
and branches, of the leaves or of the flowers, 
the whole vegetable world would perhaps have 





perished, or some at least of its productions would 
have become extinct in consequence of their 
depredations; but by this arrangement so little 
of each part is usually taken, that while the wants 
of insects are fully satisfied, vegetation, generally 
speaking, sustains no injury. 

Mr. B. 

So far from sustaining injury, it is greatly indebt¬ 
ed to insects for its fertility and beauty. Though 
they are sometimes permitted to exceed the 
boundary which the God of nature has assigned to 
them, and to prove to us what they could do 
if a watchful providence did not control their 
operations, they deserve to be regarded, in general, 
as the conservators of the vegetable creation. 
They dig and prune where human foot has never 
trod, and preserve the virgin soil of many an 
unexplored region in a state of rich and verdant 
cultivation, adapted to supply the wants of the 
numerous wild animals that range over it, and 
ready for the hand of man when he arrives to 
take possession. 

Even in cultivated lands, the benefits insects 
confer, greatly exceed in amount the injuries of 
which we sometimes so loudly complain. 





In many plants, particularly those of the Linnean 
classes, Monoecia , Dioecia and Polygamia , in 
which the stamens are in one blossom and the 
pistils in another, their agency in conveying the 
fertilizing pollen from the anthers to the germen, 
is essential to the production of fruit. 

Insects that attack our embryo fruits, or crop 
the luxuriant foliage of the trees, do us much 
service both by preventing an over growth of 
fruit, and by rendering its leafy covering more 
pervious to the air and sun. They do 
indeed just what the skilful gardener often 
does when he thins the fruit and prunes the 
leaves, that the tree may not be exhausted by too 
large a crop, and that the fruit which is left may 
be of finer quality. 

Even the burrowing insects, though when too 
numerous they do injury to our meadows and 
corn-fields, are of essential service by loosening the 
soil, and thereby enabling the young roots to 
shoot with greater ease. 

The agency of insects is also veiy important in 
forests, especially in the immense ones of tropical 
climates. When symptoms of decay among the 
veteran trees become apparent, their united service 





are soon employed to prevent them from long 
remaining a nuisance. A host of caterpillars 
take possession of the branches and consume the 
foliage. Another host of insects bore through the 
rind and pierce and destroy the inner bark; and 
a third, and still more numerous class, finally 
accomplish the dissolution of the dying trees by 
reducing the decayed wood to dust. 

Thus we find that, on the one hand, insects 
promote the strength and fruitfulness of plants, 
and on the other, that they present a constant 
and effectual check both to a too great exuberance 
of vegetation, and to an accumulation of decaying 
vegetable matter. They seem, indeed, to have it 
in charge to preserve the face of nature in youthful 
beauty and vigour. 

There are two species of phytiphagous insects 
which in this connection deserve especial notice: 
—Locusts and Termites. 

Frederick. 

I have always regarded locusts as among the 
most dreadful of invaders; as vieing indeed 
with human desolators in their ability to ravage 
and destroy. 





Mr. B. 

And such is their character when, commissioned 
by God, they leave their native boundaries. No 
visitation is more to be feared than 

-—-« A pitchy cloud 

Of locusts warping on the eastern wind.” 

The swarms in which they fly often measure 
several hundred fathoms in diameter and many 
miles in extent, so that in passing they thoroughly 
hide the sun, and produce a darkness as great 
as that of a total eclipse. These swarms are 
sometimes so vast as to be three or four hours in 
flying over a particular spot. Southey strikingly 
describes their progress in his Thalaba :— 

“ Onward they came, a dark, continuous cloud 
Of congregated myriads numberless, 

The rushing of whose wings was as the sound 
Of a broad river, headlong in its course, 

Plung’d from a mountain summit; or the roar 
Of a wild ocean in the autumn storm, 

Shattering its billows on a shore of rocks.” 

And when they arrive on cultivated lands it is 
awful to see the face of the country which but an 
hour before was smiling and joyous, entirely 
covered as with a living veil, extending as far as 






the eye can reach, and perhaps for many hundreds 
of miles beyond:—the trees bending beneath the 
weight of their destroyers, and every atom of 
verdure rapidly disappearing. And then to hear 
the noise of their powerful jaws, like the sound 
of a flame of fire driven by the wind, as meadows, 
corn-fields, vineyards, orchards, and forests, are 
rapidly falling victims to their irresistible sway. 

Nor is this all. The effluvium from the dead 
bodies of these countless myriads fills the air with 
impurity, and often produces pestilence of a fear¬ 
ful character. Mr. Barrow, speaking of their 
ravages in the southern part of Africa, towards the 
close of the last century, says that an area of 
nearly two thousand square miles was literally 
covered by them; and that when driven into 
the sea by the wind, they formed upon the shore 
for fifty miles a bank three or four feet high, 
the scent of which was so powerful as to be smelt, 
when the wind lay in the right direction, at a 
distance of a hundred and fifty miles. 

Emma. 

You recal to my recollection Mrs. Howitt's 
description of the locust. 





Mr. B. 

Will you favour us by reciting it ? 

Emma. 

" The locust is fierce, and strong, and grim, 

And an armed man is afraid of him; 

He comes like a winged shape of dread, 

With his shielded back and his armed head, 

And his double wings, for hasty flight, 

And a keen, unwearying appetite. 

He comes with famine and fear along, 

An army a million million strong ; 

The Goth, and the Vandal, and dwarfish Hun, 
With their swarming people, wild and dun, 
Brought not the dread that the locust brings, 
When is heard the rush of their myriad wings. 

From the deserts of burning sand they speed, 
Where the lions roam and the serpents breed ; 

Far over the sea, away, away ! 

And they darken the sun at noon of day ; 

Like Eden the land before they find, 

But they leave it a desolate waste behind. 

The peasant grows pale when he sees them come, 
And standeth before them weak and dumb ; 

For they come like a raging fire in power, 

And eat up a harvest in half an hour ; 

And the trees are bare, and the land is brown, 

As if trampled and trod by an army down. 





There is terror in every monarch's eye, 

When he hears that this terrible foe is nigh ; 

For he knows that the might of an armed host 
Cannot drive the spoiler from out his coast, 

That terror and famine his land await, 

And from north to south 'twill be desolate. 

Thus the ravening locust is strong and grim, 

And what were an armed man to him ? 

Fire turneth him not, nor sea prevents, 

He is stronger by far than the elements ! 

The broad green earth is his prostrate prey, 

And he darkens the sun at noon of day !” 

Mr. B. 

Thank you. One or two lines put me in mind of 
a passage in the second chapter of Joel, in which 
the arrival and devastations of locusts are graphi¬ 
cally and sublimely described :—“ A day of 
darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and 
of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon 
the mountains; a great people and a strong :— 
a fire devoureth before them, and behind them 
a flame burnetii: the land is as the garden of 
Eden before them; and behind them a desolate 
wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.” 

When locusts visit a country, they usually stay 
from three to seven years, and generally reduce it 
to a state of entire desolation. 





Yet even locusts, fearful as are their visits to 
inhabited countries, do immense good within 
their native boundaries. Their home is in the 
deserts of Tartary and Arabia ; and many a 
region in these and the neighbouring untrodden 
wastes, which but for them would be permanent¬ 
ly choked up by shrubs, and hard, half-withered 
and unpalatable plants and grasses, being from 
time to time by their means disincumbered of its 
burden, and thoroughly laid bare, continually re¬ 
appears clothed in a young and flowery herbage, 
whose juicy shoots afford delicious food for the 
numerous animals that tenant those solitary plains. 

Frederick. 

I suppose the countries adjacent to Arabia and 
Tartary are most exposed to the ravages of locusts. 

Mr. B. 

Yes. The first mention we have of them is, 
as you will remember, in connection with Egypt.* 
Africa has always been peculiarly liable to these 
visitations; and from Africa locusts have not 
unfrequently passed over into different parts of 
Europe. Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and 
particularly Transylvania, have been repeatedly 
visited by these invaders. 

* Exodus x, 12—14. 





More than once they have appeared even in 
our island. In the year 1673 some alighted in 
Wales; and in the year 1748 considerable alarm 
was excited by swarms falling in various parts 
of England, particularly in the neighbourhood of 
London. Happily, however, they soon perished 
without propagating. These swarms were pro¬ 
bably stragglers from the host which, the year 
before, had laid waste Transylvania and the 
neighbouring provinces. 

Dr. Clarke, in his travels in Tartary, describes 
three species of locusts :—the gryllus tartarius 
and the gryllus migratorius , whose visit to the 
steppes of Tartary he witnessed, and the gryllus 
viridissimus found near the Don and the Khuban. 
The gryllus tartarius is a very large species; and 
from its usually appearing before the gryllus 
migratorius, is called the herald or messenger. 
The gryllus migratorius, or migratory locust, 
has red legs, and its inferior wings have, he 
informs us, a lively red colour, which gives a bright 
fiery appearance to the animal when fluttering 
in the sun’s rays. 

Termites, or white ants, are another class of 
insects endowed with peculiar powers either for 
good or evil. 





Mrs. B. 

Linn6 called them the great calamity of both 
the Indies. 

Mr. B. 

He did; but I think from taking a partial 
view of them; from looking at the mischief 
rather than at the good they do. Immense 
damage is often sustained, it is true, when they 
find their way into houses and stores, from their 
insatiable and undistinguishing voracity. Nothing 
less hard than glass or metal escapes the attacks of 
their omniverous jaws. In the course of one 
night, they frequently destroy all the furniture, 
and indeed all the timber-work of a spacious 
apartment, together with books, papers, clothes, 
or whatever other valuables it may contain. But 
still, these mischiefs, serious as indeed they some¬ 
times are, are of small amount, it appears to me, 
in comparison with the benefits which termites 
confer on the inhabitants of tropical countries by 
the effectual check they continually impose on 
the accumulation of decaved vegetable substances. 

In our climate, where the process of vegetation 
and of decay is comparatively slow, it is difficult 
properly to appreciate their agency; but in the 




countries of the torrid zone, where perhaps many 
thousands of acres are covered by one interminable 
forest, and where but for such insects as the 
termites, the dying and the dead would con¬ 
tinually lie in gloomy contrast with the living, 
the verdant characters of youth, and beauty every 
where apparent sufficiently bespeak the value of 
their labours. In a few months, a mighty mass, 
inferior only to iron in hardness, and which, left 
to the mere action of the elements, would perhaps 
have encumbered the ground for a century, is 
mouldered into dust; and young trees, full of 
life and vigour, spring up in its place. Mr. 
Smeathman assures us that the termites will not 
only in a few weeks destroy and carry away the 
trunks of large trees, without leaving a particle 
behind, but that in places where there has been 
a populous town, if the inhabitants, as is often 
the case in India, have chosen to abandon it, in 
the course of two or three years, not even a post 
will be visible, but its site will be occupied by 
a large wood. 

One peculiarity in these insects is that they 
usually carry on their operations by sap and 
mine; so that when, by eating the interior 





substance, they have entirely spoiled any wooden 
fabric, a chair or table for example, it still ex¬ 
ternally appears untouched. They rarely attack 
the outside of any material, until they have 
concealed it and their operations by a coating 

of clay. 

* 

Emma. 

I am glad we have no white ants here; it 
must be extremely vexatious to find valuable 
articles so suddenly and imperceptibly destroyed. 

Mr. B. 

I am glad too, Emma, that we have not. It 
would be a sad thing for us, who require ten 
times more timber than our climate can produce, 
to be subject to such marauders. There are 
however insects, even in our country, that are 
employed in performing, though much more 
gradually, the same services and the same mischiefs 
that the termites perform in India. We have 
several species to whom the oak beam of an 
ancient edifice that has weathered the storms 
of several hundreds of years, or a chair that 
has been baking in the chimney corner for half 
a century, or a book that has been mouldering 
as long on the shelf, are morsels far more delicious 





than the finest living productions of the garden 
or the forest. You have often, I dare say, seen 
furniture 

“ By worms voracious eaten through and through 

but perhaps you did not know that these per¬ 
forations are the work of a little timber-boring 
beetle, (Anobium,) whose larvae flourish and 
fatten on this dry fare. Our houses, our timber- 
yards, our bridges, and even our piers erected 
in salt water, not unfrequently suffer injury from 
similar destroyers. 

But let us take another view of vegetable-eating 
insects; for we shall have but an imperfect idea 
of their character and importance, if we confine 
ourselves to an agricultural view of them, and 
enquire only how they affect our orchards and 
gardens, our corn-fields and forests. Besides 
their agricultural services, they render us others 
of incalculable value; services even more sensibly 
felt and much more readily acknowledged. You 
will at once perceive that I refer to the various 
productions for which we are indebted to them. 

You are too well acquainted with the two 
families which man has taken under his own im- 





mediate protection and management, bees and silk¬ 
worms, to make it necessary to dwell on the 
importance of their labours; but perhaps you are 
not aware that there are various other little manu¬ 
factures of this class to whom literature and the 
arts each owe a large debt of gratitude. 

Emma, 

Literature! Papa. 

Mr. B. 

Yes, Emma; literature . You could not be 
furnished either with ink to write a letter, or wax 
to seal it, without the aid of insects. I do not 
mean to say that they make either the ink or the 
wax; but they produce some of the ingredients 
most essential in the composition of these articles. 

Ink is made by a decoction of blue galls with 
copperas and other materials. These galls are 
excrescences found on the leaves of a shrubby 
species of oak, ( Quercus infectoria,) very common 
throughout Asia Minor, and are produced by a 
little hymenopterous insect belonging to the genus 
Cynips . The little fly punctures the surface 
of the leaf and deposits an egg; around which, 
in the course of a few hours, a fleshy chamber 
arises, that provides both food and shelter for 




her future offspring, and becomes what is called 
a gall or galUnut. 

Thus through the intervention of a little insect, 
a tree, valueless in itself, yields to the merchants 
of Aleppo one of their chief articles of commerce. 
These galls are much used by dyers as well as 
by manufacturers of ink, and large quantities of 
them are every year imported. From their im¬ 
portance to dyers, the oak on which they are 
found receives its name of Quercus infectoria 
or the Dyer's oak. 

Frederick. 

I suppose what we call oak-apples are produced 
in the same manner. 

Mr. B. 

Yes; there are many varieties of these ex¬ 
crescences ; some resembling beautiful fruits; 
others curious flowers; in short, they assume 
a hundred different forms; but they all owe 
their existence to insect labourers. 

Mrs. B. 

Some of them puzzled the old botanists not a 
little. The curious coronet of leaves, for instance, 
resembling in arrangement the petals of a rose, 
by which the twigs of the common willow are 




sometimes surrounded, and which is formed by 
the deposition of the minute eggs of these little 
creatures, is figured by Gerard as belonging to 
a distinct species of tree, which he terms the rose - 
willow , and which he describes as not only making 
Ci a gallant shew, but also yielding a most cooling 
air in the heat of summer, being set up in houses 
for the decking of the same.” 

Mr. B. 

Your mention of the rose-willow , my dear, 
reminds me of another production of the same 
kind, to which the naturalists of former days 
attributed medicinal properties of an equally 
wonderful character. 

You must have often noticed, Emma, in your 
botanical researches, a tuft of little reddish moss¬ 
like fibres totally different from the leaves, growing 
round the twigs of the sweet-briar and the common 
wild-rose. 

Emma. 

Yes, I have; and I have wondered what it 
could be. 

Mr. B. 

This curious and beautiful excrescence is the 
bedeguar , once so famed for its styptic properties. 





Its medicinal renown is, I believe, now at an end; 
but all must still admire it as an elegant provision 
which a little insect of this order, the Cynips 
rosce , has made, by puncturing the twig, for the 
shelter and maintenance of its young. 

Emma. 

It appears to me that by the study of insects, 
I shall gain also much information on my fa¬ 
vourite study of botany. 

Mr. B. 

The various branches of natural history, my 
love, are all so intimately connected, that it is 
impossible to pursue any one far, without also 
directing attention to others. To become a 
geologist, for example, it is necessary to study 
not only mineralogy, but also anatomy, botany, 
and chemistry; and to be a good botanist, you 
must be also, in some degree at least, an ento¬ 
mologist. 

Emma. 

You make me feel, Papa, how very ignorant 
I am. 

Mr. B. 

Well, Emma; you know the adage, u A sense 
of ignorance is the first step to knowledge;”— 





but we are wandering from our subject;—I hope 
I have satisfactorily proved your obligations with 
regard to ink . 

Emma. 

O yes. I am quite ready to acknowledge them— 
but sealing-wax, Papa? 

Mr. B. 

A principal ingredient in sealing-wax is a resin 
called lac. This resin is produced by a species 
of coccus, (Coccus lacca;) the female insects 
haying fixed themselves to a twig of the banian, 
the pepel, or other tree on which they feed, a 
pellucid and glutinous substance begins to exude 
from the margins of the body, and in time, the 
whole insect is covered with a cell of this substance, 
which, when hardened by exposure to the air, 
becomes lac . Under these cells the mother insects 
lay their eggs; w hie h, aftera certain period, are 
hatched, and the young ones eat their way out. 

Lac is not only used in the composition of 
sealing-wax, but it is extensively employed in 
the manufacture of hats. A varnish, highly 
esteemed by artists, is also made from it; and 
when collected before the larvae have found their 
way out, it yields moreover an excellent scarlet 




dye. So variously useful is this insect secretion, 
that from one to two million pounds weight 
of it are annually imported into Great Britain * 

Kermes is another drug valuable to the dyer. 
We cannot call it the 'production of an insect, for 
it is the insect itself. These insects, also a species 
of coccus, are found on a kind of oak (Quercus 
coccifera,) growing in the Levant, which, like 
that from which gall-nuts are gathered, is valuable 
only on account of its insect inhabitants. 

Kermes are supposed to have furnished the 
material with which the curtains of the Taber¬ 
nacle manufactured in the wilderness, were dyed 
red. From the same insects also the crimson 
of the Greeks and Romans was produced, and 
the imperishable red of the Flemish tapestries. 

The coccus cacti , or cochineal, now supplies 
us with our most valuable scarlet dye. This 
beautiful little creature obtains its colour by feeding 
on the delicate red juice of a particular kind of 
cactuSf or Indian fig, called in Mexico, where 
alone the insect is produced in any quantity, Nopal . 
So valuable is this insect, that the East India 
Company have offered a reward of ,£6000 to any 
one who shall introduce it into India. The 




quantity of cochineal exported yearly from America 
is said to be worth more than half a million of 
money, 

Frederick, 

Really, Father, I could not have supposed that 
the commerce of the world could be so largely 
indebted to any one insect, 

Mr. B. 

There are some to which it is under still greater 
obligations. The silk-worm adds many millions 
a year to the commercial wealth of nations; 
and wax and honey are far from being unim¬ 
portant articles of commerce. 

Frederick. 

Does silk produce many millions a year ? 

Mr. B. 

Yes, many millions. Were silk no longer 
produced, the commerce of many parts of the 
world would stand still, and the people would 
starve. In several large provinces in the south 
of Europe, silk is the staple article of cultivation, 
and the prospect of a deficient crop causes as 
great an alarm as a scanty harvest of grain does 
among us. Many thousands of persons are em¬ 
ployed in its first production and transportation ; 




and many hundreds of thousands more in its final 
manufacture ; so that silk may be said to be one 
of the most important wheels that give circulation 
to national wealth. 

Emma. 

The productions of bees have been valued from 
the earliest times. 

Mr. B. 

Bees have furnished us not only with choice 
productions but with some of our choicest and 
* most expressive words. A poet remarkable for 
the sweetness and harmony of his language, is 
said to be a “bee;” notes peculiarly soft and 
pleasing to the ear are said to be “ mellifluous 
and if we would express in one word that which 
is pure and true, we call it, in allusion to honey 
drawn clear from the comb, sincere (sine cera.) 

Frederick. 

Honey is not much used now, is it ? 

 

It is not so much used in our own country 
as it used to be. In the good old times, house¬ 
wives made from it their mead or metheglin , 
which might vie with the productions of the 
vine in warmer climates. In the present day, 







we are so amply supplied with sugar that we 
can nearly dispense with with it; but in many 
inland parts of Europe, where sugar is scarce 
and dear, it is still a necessary article of 
domestic consumption; and the care of bees is 
in the same proportion a lucrative branch of 
agriculture. Some of the peasants in the Ukraine 
have four or five-hundred bee-hives, and make 
more profit of their honey than of com. In 
Spain, this luscious production is still more 
assiduously cultivated. A single parish priest 
has been known to possess five thousand hives. 

Wax is a substance almost more important 
than honev. Our climate indeed is not so warm 



as to render tallow candles intolerable, as they 
are in some more southern countries; still, even 
with us, wax candles are deemed indispensable 
to the comfort of the great; wax is consequently, 
for the manufacture of candles, as well as for 
many other purposes, an important production to 
us, and large quantities are imported from different 
countries. Some idea of the value of wax as an 
article of commerce may be formed from the fact 
that the quantity of it exported from the island of 
Cuba alone, in one year, was worth more than a 
hundred and thirty thousand pounds. 



Emma. 



Do any insects besides bees produce wax ? 

Mr. B. 

A kind called Pe-la is produced in China by 
a species of coccus, which is said, when mixed 
with oil, to form a wax little inferior to that 
made by bees, but the wax used in Europe and 
America is all the produce of bees, principally 
of the common hive-bee; though in America, 
a quantity by no means trifling, is obtained from 
various wild species. 

The wax of China is in high repute among 
Chinese physicians for its numerous wonderful 
qualities; among others, for that of giving assu¬ 
rance to public speakers. We are told that the 
orators of that country eat an ounce of it, pre¬ 
vious to commencing their harangues, to prevent 
srvoonings. 

Frederick. 

An excellent idea! 

Mr. B. 

We laugh at the nostrums of China-men, but 
we should remember that many in high repute 
in our own country a hundred years ago, were 
scarcely less absurd: what should we now think 






of powder of silk-worm as a remedy for vertigo 
and convulsions; of earwigs to strengthen the 
nerves; of fly-water for disorders in the eyes; of 
lady-birds for the colic and measles; or of the 
cock-chafer for the bite of a mad-dog and the 
plague ? 

Emma. 

You are not in earnest, Papa ! 

Mr. B. 

Yes, my love, I assure you, I am. Such 
remedies, ridiculous as they may now seem, were 
really in fashion in England a century ago, and 
empirics highly extolled their virtues. 

Speaking of insects in relation to the healing 
art, we must not forget that there are two or 
three to which we are under real obligations. 
Among them I may mention a species of ant, 
which collects from the bombyx or silk-cotton 
tree, a kind of lint, said to be invaluable as a 
styptic; and the Cantharides or blister-flies; 
almost any article could be better spared from 
the materia medica than these flies. Their bodies 
contain a peculiar acrid matter which when 
applied to the skin, causes inflammation and 
raises blisters. The application, it is true, is 




painful; but it often effectually counteracts inter¬ 
nal inflammatory action. 

Mrs. B. 

I believe the living insect if held long in the 
hand, will produce the same effect as the can- 
tharideous plaster. 

Mr. B. 

Yes, it will; indeed, even the vapour from 
these beetles has a powerful effect on the human 
frame. Instances have been known of persons 
being attacked with violent fever from having 
fallen asleep under trees inhabited by them. 
An effect similar to that of cantharides, though 
in a much less degree, is said to be produced 
by the may-bug or cock-chafer. 

Emma. 

Where are cantharides found ? 

Mr. B. 

They are natives of almost every country of 
Europe, particularly those towards the south. 
Now and then, though very rarely, they are 
seen in this country. In the summer of 1837, 

they appeared, I am told, near Colchester, in 



great numbers, and stripped all the ash-trees of 
their leaves.

Haying taken a glance at vegetable-eating 
insects in their various relations to agriculture, to 
literature and the arts, to commerce and to 
medicine, we will now look at a few as furnishing 
us with food. 

Emma. 

With food, Papa! 

Mr. B. 

Yes: several are eaten as a mere matter of 
taste. Many people in our country, you know, 
are fond of cheese-maggots, and I have heard 
of such a dainty dish as a maggot-pie, though 
I cannot say that I ever saw one. In the West 
Indies some epicures greatly admire the grub of 
the palm-weevil; and in many countries the 
larvae of the larger capricorn beetles are esteem¬ 
ed delicacies. The Cossus of Pliny, which he 
tells us the Roman epicures fattened with flour, 
was probably a species of these larvae. 

Passing fry these, however, I must again 
introduce to you the two families which I have 
already mentioned, as so powerful for good or 
evil—locusts and termites—as making some a- 
mends for the ravages of which they are occa- 



sionally guilty, by the supply of food they furnish 
to various nations. 

Frederick. 

Were not locusts considered clean insects and 
permitted as food by the Jewish law? 

Mr. B. 

Yes: and they were much eaten in Judea by 
those who had no flocks or herds on -which to 
feed. It is mentioned, you know, as a proof of 
the simple style of life adopted by John the 
Baptist, that “his meat was locusts and wild 
honey.—Insects alone supplied his table in the 
wilderness. 

In the present day, the nomade tribes of the 
desert, as well as the poor inhabitants of Arab 
villages, collect locusts in great quantities both 
for their own eating, and for sale; for these 
insects are highly relished by people of all classes 
in that part of the world. They are prepared 
pretty much as shrimps and lobsters are prepared 
with us, by being thrown alive into boiling water, 
mixed with a good quantity of salt. After boiling 
for a short time, they are taken out, the head, 
wings, and legs are picked off, and the trunks 
laid to drv in the sun. 


When thoroughly dried, they are stowed away 
in sacks, ready either for exportation to the States 
of Barbary and other neighbouring countries, 
where in this state they find speedy sale, or for 
home consumption. They are frequently eaten 
either alone, or mixed with butter, and spread on 
cakes of bread; but sometimes they are stewed 
or fried in butter. Mr. Moffat, who has eaten 
them in Africa, says that on the whole they 
are not bad food. When well fed they are almost 
as good as shrimps. 

Mrs. B. 

They appear to be a favourite article of food 
with most of the African nations as well as with 
the Arabs. I have read that the poor Hottentots, 
so far from regarding the arrival of a swarm as 
a calamity, are highly rejoiced at it, and that 
they soon exhibit, in their improved looks, the 
good effects of their improved fare. 

Mr. B. 

Mr. Moffat tells us, that when locusts abound, 
the natives become quite fat, and would even 
reward any old lady that said she had coaxed 
them to alight within reach of the inhabitants. 
He adds, speaking of a visitation of them which 





he witnessed, “ We could not feel otherwise than 
thankful for this visitation on account of the poor; 
many hundreds of families, but for the locusts, 
must have perished with hunger.” 

Termites are also eaten in large quantities by 
some of the African nations; among the Hotten¬ 
tots especially they are esteemed an important 
article of food. After swarming, shoals of them 
fall into the rivers, when they are skimmed off 
in calabashes, and parched in iron pots over a 
gentle fire, in the same manner as we roast coffee. 
In this state they are eaten without any addition, 
and considered great delicacies. Mr. Smeathman, 
to whom we are indebted for nearly all that is 
known of these insects, says that he has eaten 
them dressed in this way, and thought them 
delicate, nourishing, and wholesome: sweeter 
than the grub of the palm-weevil, but not so 
fat and cloying. Their taste, he tells us, resembles 
sugared cream or sweet almond paste. 

Mrs. B. 

White ants are eaten in the East Indies also, 
I believe. 


Mr. B. 


Yes they are. The female ant in particular 




is supposed by the Hindoos to contain highly 
nutritive qualities, and is eaten not only as a 
delicacy but as a restorative in cases of debility. 

Well, I have now onlv to add a nice dessert 
and an agreeable beverage, and you will, I think, 
acknowledge that mv bill of insect fare is 
complete. 

Emma. 

I suppose you mean honey and mead. 

Mr. B. 

You may add them, if you please, but I intended 

something nicer still. 



I told you that some of the galls resemble in 
form certain fruits ; this resemblance sometimes 
holds in flavour also, particularly in those that 
are found on some kinds of sage; they are very 
juicy like apples, and are highly esteemed in 
the Levant for their aromatic and acid flavour. 
Prepared with sugar, they form a considerable 
article of commerce from Scio to Constantinople, 
and will present us with a dessert of an inviting 
character. 

And now for a beverage.—You like lemonade ? 

Emma. 

Lemonade ! Papa. 





Mr. B. 

Yes, Emma, lemonade , or perhaps I ought rather 
to call this insect beverage, formicade . If in 
biting a gooseberry or a plum, you have ever 
happened to bite an ant concealed in it, you have 
perceived that it had an agreeable acid taste. Ants 
contain this acid so abundantly, that chemists 
procure it from them in considerable quantities, 
either by distillation or infusion in water. I shall 
not send you, however, to the chemists, but to 
the ants themselves. You have only to place 
a piece of sugar for a few minutes in a nest of 
yellow ants, which may often be met with in 
woods, and it will absorb such a quantity of 
their acid, which is a perfect substitute for that 
of lemon, as will make you a nice glass of your 
favourite beverage. 

Frederick. 

The acid procured from ants is called by the 
chemists, formic acid, is it not ? 

Mr. B. 

It used to be so called; but it is now ascer¬ 
tained to be not a distinct kind of acid, but 
a mixture of the acetic and malic . 

The copious secretion of acid in ants may 





perhaps be accounted for from the saccharine 
nature of their food. They live very principally 
on that sweet fluid ejected by aphides, which 
when left to dry upon the leaves of plants, is 
commonly called honey dew . Wherever aphides 
abound, there you will be sure to find ants very 
busy, caressing the little insects to part with 
their luscious stores, and eagerly lapping up 
the excrementitious sweet the moment it is yielded. 

In connection with the habitations and social 
economy of insects, I shall tell you something 
more about ants and aphides; but it is too late 
this evening. 

Frederick. 

You have said nothing yet, Father, about 
carnivorous insects. 

Mr. B. 

I have not forgotten them; but I have now 
purposely confined myself to the phytiphagi , 
that I may introduce the carnivorous tribes to 
more advantage another time. They are equally 
valuable servants; but their work is of a different 
and less pleasing character. 


NINTH EVENING. 


Carnivorous insects.—Those that feed on living prey: 
cicindelse, carabi, water-beetles, lady-birds; mantis, 
earwigs, nepidae, notonectidse; ant-lion, dragon-fly, lace- 
flies ; ichneumon flies, sand-wasps, ants.—Those that 
feed on dead or decayed substances: larvae of various 
insects; silphae, necrophori.—Those that suck the blood 
of other animals: parasitic insects, fleas, gnats, and 
mosquitoes.—Means employed to prevent the too great 
increase of insects: rains, frosts, inundations; insect- 
catching plants; animals that consume insects; bats, 
birds, fishes, &c.—Calculations on the probable number 
of unknown species. 


At our last entomological soiree, I promised 
you some account of carnivorous insects ; a division 
equally numerous and useful with the phytiphagous 
tribes, though less generally observed and admired. 
If it will be agreeable to you, I shall be happy 
now to give an hour to the subject. 

Frederick. 

We were hoping you would indulge us this 
evening. 

Carnivorous insects may be chiefly divided into 
three classes:—those that prey on living insects; 





those that feed on dead and decaying; animal 
matter; and those that suck the blood of other 
animals, many of which are parasitic. 

The first class, those that feed on insects, are 
very largely distributed throughout the various 
orders; indeed, I do not recollect one in which 
some may not be pointed out as occasionally at 
least employing themselves in the destruction of 
their neighbours. 

Emma, 

There are none, surely, among my little favour¬ 
ites the Lepidoptera ? 

Mr. B. 

Yes; even the Lepidoptera , under some circum¬ 
stances will eat each other. Reaumur once put 
together into a glass vessel twenty caterpillars 
of the same species, and though he supplied them 
abundantly with their natural food, they never¬ 
theless devoured one another, till only one survived. 

Emma. 

What little cannibals! 

Mr. B. 

Several others of the phytiphagi occasionally 
exhibit similar cannibal propensities. Locusts, 
grass-hoppers, and crickets have also been known 




to devour their congeners, especially when in 
confinement, in the most savage manner. But 
carnivorous insects, properly so called, are those 
that feed constantly and exclusively upon animal 
food: some, only when larvae; others, through¬ 
out their whole existence. 

Three families of the Coleoptera , the Cicindel( 2 > 
the Carabi , and the Dytisci are thus exclusively 
carnivorous. 

Frederick. 

To look at the cicindelce with their elegant forms 
and splendid attire, one would not suspect them 
of sanguinary propensities. 

Mr. B. 

Like some other beings they conceal beneath 
a gay exterior very unlovely propensities. We 
have six or seven varieties of them in England; 
the most common is the cicindela campestris , 
which, when captured, usually ejects a volatile 
fluid, having a powerful scent of roses. The 
eicindelae frequent dry places exposed to the sun, 
run very fast, and employ their wings with more 
activity than most other beetles. Their larvae 
form for themselves habitations in the earth, 
something like those of the ant-lion, which they 





nearly resemble in cunning and ferocity. The 
name cicindela means a brilliant insect. 

The carabi are a very numerous family, but, 
generally speaking, far less beautiful and interesting 
than the cicindelse. Like their counterparts, tigers 
and lions and other carnivorous beasts, they roam 
by night in search of prey, and lurk during 
the day in any convenient retreat; generally, 
beneath stones or in crevices, or under loose earth 
or the bark of trees. They run, as I have before 
told you, with immense speed ; and many of them, 
when caught, resent the affront by ejecting a dark 
fetid liquid that stains the skin and often pro¬ 
duces pain and irritation. 

Emma. 

Most of the specimens in the cabinet are sombre 
looking creatures. Their very appearance would 
lead one to suspect their character. 

Mr. B. 

The majority are sufficiently uninviting; but 
some of them are pretty, the little sun-bugs or 
sun-shiners, for example; and especially the calo- 
somae; thev indeed derive their name from their 
elegance and splendour. 

The calosomce differ from the generality of 




the carabi in their habits as well as in their 
appearance. They live upon trees, both in their 
larva and perfect states; and by preying upon 
caterpillars which would otherwise denude the 
branches of their foliage, render us valuable 
services. The calosoma inquisitor is occasionally 
so numerous that a friend of mine beat down, 
at one time, as many as sixty specimens from the 
oaks in Epping Forest. The calosoma syco- 
phanta is equally numerous and useful in the 
forests of France and Germany; it feeds upon 
the different inseets that inhabit and injure oaks; 
especially upon the amusing but mischievous pro¬ 
cessionary caterpillars, living while larvae in their 
nests, and like true sycophants , ruining the society 
in which they repose. 

The dytisci , or water-beetles, are to be found 
both in their larva and mature states, in the 
tranquil waters of lakes, marshes, and ponds. 
They too are extremely voracious, and seize and 
devour without mercy all insects that come within 
their reach. 

Emma. 



I remember you pointed out how admirably 
their legs are adapted for swimming. 





Mr. B. 

If you look at the specimens in the cabinet, you 
will perceive that there are many varieties of size 
among them; some are at least an inch and a 
half long; others are scarcely larger than fleas. 
Like the carabi they shed, when handled, a most 
nauseous odour. 

Among our insect-eating Coleoptera , I must 
not omit to mention those general little favourites, 
ladv-birds. I told vou that thev alwavs lav 
their eggs among aphides. Their larvae feed 
entirely upon them, and thus prevent manv 
a plant from withering under the exhaustion 
which these minute phlebotomists, when too nu¬ 
merous, occasion. If we could multiply lady¬ 
birds at will, we might perhaps entirely extirpate 
the fly , that species of aphis which so often 
disappoints the hopes of the hop-grower. 

Emma. 

Are any of the Orthoptera carnivorous ? 

Mr. B. 

Some of the cursorial Orthoptera are. The 
mantis, profanely called the praying mantis, and 
said to be so benign a creature, that, “ if a childe 
aske the way to such a place, she will stretch out 
one of her feet and shew him the right way, and 




seldome or never misse,” is an exceedingly ferocious 
insect. Having little muscular energy, and yet 
requiring a large supply of food, he makes up 
in stratagem and patience what he wants in power. 
When he has once set his eyes upon a victim, he 
rarely loses sight of it, but will patiently sit, even 
though it may be hours before it come within 
his reach, in an attitude prepared for seizing it. 

It is the attitude thus assumed, which has 
obtained for this sanguinary little creature, among 
the ignorant, such universal veneration. In every 
country where it is known it has some religious 
epithet: the French call it le precheur ; the Turks 
say it points to Mecca. 

Another of the cursorial Orthoptera , the earwig, 
though it may delicately appear to prefer a juicy 
pear or plum, or the brilliant petals of a carnation 
or a dahlia, is strongly suspected of cannibal 
propensities: but as it flies and feeds by night, it 
is difficult to prove the fact. It is certain that it 
eats dead insects; there is no plunderer against 
whom the collector need to be more on his guard. 

Emma. 

Do earwigs ever creep into the ear, and penetrate 
to the brain ? 



Mr. B. 

O no! Even supposing one to enter the ear, 
the structure of that organ, and the secretion of 
wax, which appears intended as a defence from all 
intruders, prevent the possibility of its penetrating 
into the head. 

Among the Hemiptera many species of bugs 
live on the juices of insects. The Nepidco are 
extremely voracious; and the little boat-flies, or 
water-boatmen as some call them, (No toned idee ) 
which may often be observed lying on their backs 
on the surface of the water, stretched in an 
attitude of apparent listlessness, are not behind 
their larger and more powerful neighbours either 
in cunning or in cruelty. The moment a luckless 
wanderer passes within their reach, it is darted 
upon and quickly carried off. 

I need not repeat what I have already told you 
respecting some of the carnivorous Neuroptera. 
The names which have been given them, such as 
ant-lion and dragon-fly , sufficiently bespeak their 
habits; to them I may add the beautiful little 
lace-flies, (Hemerobii) whose larvae make so 
great a carnage among aphides that Reaumur 
called them “Lions des pucerons,” Lions of the 
aphides . 

 


Two families of the Hymenoptera, ichneumon- 
flies and sand-wasps, have also been already 
noticed. Both, though in the mature state nectar¬ 
sipping flies, are formidable enemies of many 
species of insects, from the numbers they destroy 
as food for their young. You remember in what 
manner many a caterpillar is murdered by the 
insidious ichneumons, and with what wondrous 
skill and labour sand-wasps bury insects alive. 
When you know that in Europe alone, there are 
at least thirteen hundred species of ichneumon- 
flies, each of which attacks the larva of a different 
insect; and that the varieties of sand-wasps and 
other fossorial Hymenoptera that provide living 
prey for their young, are also very numerous, 
vou will easilv believe that these two families 
effectually check the increase of many of the 
most prolific species of vegetable-eating insects. 

Frederick. 

Are not ants carnivorous ? 

Mr. B. 

Not exclusively; though they certainly deserve 
a place among carnivorous insects. The mantis, 
fierce as it is, knows its fate, and exhibits signs 
of terror, when brought into contact with them. 
Uniting in bodies of sufficient numbers and 





strength, they kill and cany off to their nests 
the largest and most formidable insects, and even 
a single ant may sometimes be seen dragging 
a victim many times bigger than itself. Under 
favourable circumstances, ants will even attack 
animals of larger size. They are also expert 
dissectors; if you wish for the skeleton of a bird, 
a mouse, or any other small quadruped, you have 
on ly to place the body in a box sufficiently per¬ 
forated with holes to admit them, and leave it near 
a nest, and they will prepare it for you most skilfully. 

We are told of one species of ant that is even 
daring enough to attack mankind. M. Malouet 
observed in the forests of Guiana a gigantic 
hillock fifteen or twenty feet high, and broad in 
proportion, towering in the midst of a spacious 
savannah, which he was informed was the dwelling 
of the largest species of black ant; a species so 
numerous and sanguinary, that any person ven¬ 
turing within the precincts of a society of these 
ants is almost sure of being devoured. If thev 
choose to establish themselves in any neighbour¬ 
hood, the colonists, it is said, are obliged to 
abandon it, unless they have sufficient force to 
form a regular siege. Nothing but fire and 
cannon-shot can resist them. 




Mrs. B. 

In a country teeming as Guiana so remarkably 
does, with a gigantic insect population, such an 
enemy seems needful to lessen their numbers, and 
repress their depredations. 

Frederick. 

I do not envy the inhabitants either their 
luxuriant climate or their brilliant insects, if they 
must also have such compatriots. 

Mr. B. 

My second class of carnivorous insects may 
be truly and properly called scavengers . In¬ 
cessantly employed in their disgusting but ne¬ 
cessary toils, millions of these labourers, with 
appetites and skill proportioned to the work they 
have to do, clear away the various dead bodies 
and other offensive substances that are daily falling 
to the earth ; so that, of the multitudes of insects, 
birds, and other animals that are continually dying, 
it is seldom that even one meets the eye. 

Among these, some species of larva hold, as 
you already know, a conspicuous place; but 
there are some perfect insects, to which we are 
under equal, and perhaps even greater, obli¬ 
gations. I refer to various beetles of the Silpha 



genus, whose olfactory powers are so keen, that like 
vultures they scent from afar the carrion upon which 
they feed, and will come soaring along, sweeping 
with the velocity of a bee around the cadaverous 
substance which has attracted them. The offen¬ 
sive appearance of the Silphce , properly so called, 
and the fetid odour they exhale, sufficiently in¬ 
dicate their manner of living, and their habitation. 
Both they and their larvae are chiefly to be found 
in dunghills, and in putrescent animal matter, 
and they offer nothing beyond the fact of their 
services to engage our attention. But one 
family of this genus, the necrophori , are extremely 
interesting. They receive their name from their 
peculiar habit of burying the carcases they find 
to serve as food for their young. No sooner is 
the decaying state of any small animal percep¬ 
tible, than they flock to the place, and so skilfully 
hollow out the earth underneath the body, that 
in the course of a few hours, it is entirely buried. 

Mr. Kirbv gives a most interesting account 
from an eye-witness, of the habits of one species 
of these insects, (Necrophorus vespillo.) Four 
of these little creatures were put into a glass vessel 
half-filled with earth, and properly secured. 





Upon the surface of the earth two frogs were 
laid. In less than twelve hours one of the frogs 
was interred by two of the beetles ; the other two 
ran about the whole day, as if measuring the 
dimensions of the remaining corpse, which on 
the third day was also found buried. A dead 
linnet was then introduced, upon which a pair 
of beetles were soon engaged. They began their 
operations by pushing out the earth from under 
the body, so as to form a cavity for its reception ; 
occasionally dragging at the feathers from below 
to pull it into its grave. The bird was lifted up, 
turned, trodden upon, and pulled down, till the 
next morning it was an inch and a half under 
the ground; in the evening, it had sunk half an 
inch lower; and in another day, the work was 
completed, and the bird covered. Other small 
animals continued to be added, which were all, 
sooner or later, buried; and the result of the 
experiment was, that in fifty days these four beetles 
had interred in the very small space allotted to 
them, twelve carcases:—four frogs, three small 
birds, two fishes, one mole, and two grasshoppers, 
besides the entrails of a fish, and part of the lungs 
of an ox. In another experiment, a single beetle 




buried a mole fortv times its own weight and bulk 



in two davs. 



Emma. 

I suppose they do not bury them deep. 

Mr. B. 

Generally at the depth of ten or twelve inches. 
Having: excavated the soil till the body has sunk to 
about that depth, they cover it over with the re¬ 
moved earth. 

What is still more remarkable, if the spot on 
which the carcase happens to be found is not 
suitable to the purpose of interment, four or five 
of them appear to consult together, and getting 
beneath the body, are seen to convey it slowly 
to some other that is better adapted. 

Emma. 

Wliat astonishing; instinct! I do not wonder, 
Papa, at your speaking so highly of the sagacity 
of insects. 

Mr. B. 

It is not merely by interring dead animals that 
these diligent little creatures render us service. 
Some species inter also manure, and that in such 
considerable quantities, as in some parts greatly 
to enrich and fertilize the earth. In the interest- 





ing narrative published by the u Scottish Mission 
of Enquiry respecting the Jews/* Dr. Keith and 
his companions state that they remarked in the 
desert between Egypt and Palestine numerous 
green patches on the sand, which they found to 
be produced by the industry of these small 
but indefatigable operators. “ The beetle,” they 
add, “with amazing labour drags the camel’s 
dung into its hole in the sand, and thus a fruitful 
soil is formed ready to receive the seed of plants. 
To this small insect we probably owe the greater 
part of the verdure of the wilderness.” 

Thus while phytiphagous insects dig and prune, 
these beetles manure the soil of many a desert 
region. 

We will now turn to the third class of car¬ 
nivorous insects, those that suck the blood of other 
animals. They are so universally voted a nuisance, 
that I can scarcely expect you to be of a different 
opinion. 

Mrs. B. 

Many apparent nuisances are indirectly of great 
utility. 

Mr. B. 

True, my dear: and an impartial view even 






of these insects will prove the correctness of your 
remark. Some of them are negatively useful \ lice 
and fleas, for example, by enforcing the necessity 
of attention to cleanliness ; their timely bites so 
continually remind animals of putting their fur 
or feathers in order, as to prevent the diseases 
which negligence would probably occasion ; 
and others of them, there is no doubt, render 
positive services by the continual application of 
their lancets to vigorous animals, thus averting 
the mischiefs which might arise from plethora, 
or too great fulness of blood. 

Frederick. 

But man does not require such services from 
them. 

Mr. B. 

Perhaps not : and man may, if he please, be 
free from their intrusion. It is his own fault 
if he is seriously affected by any of them. 

Frederick. 

Can he free himself from the torment of gnats 
and mosquitoes ? Our old poet Spencer says : — 

“ Their murmuring small trumpets sounden wide, 
Whiles in the air their clustering army flies ; 

Ne man nor beast may rest or take repose 
From their sharp wounds and noyous injuries/' 




Mr. B. 

I am glad you have quoted Spencer; because, 
by comparing his description with our present 
almost entire freedom from these torturing animals, 
you will be more readily convinced that the degree 
of annoyance endured from them in any country 
greatly depends on the degree in which the drain¬ 
age and cultivation of the land is neglected. The 
passage, I recollect, begins, 

“As when a swarm of gnats at even-tide 
Out of the Jennes of Allan doth arise / 7 

Wherever there ar e fens, that is to say, large tracts 
of marshy land and stagnant pools, there these 
insects, whose little egg-boats are launched, and 
whose larvse live in feculent water, are necessarily 
abundant; but in well-tilled lands, like the greater 
part of our own in the present day, where there 
are few waters but running brooks and limpid 
springs, their “ murmuring small trumpets” and 
iC clustering armies” are seldom heard or feared. 
You remember that Dr, Clarke, who was so 
seriously annoyed by them in travelling along 
the frontier of Circassia, states that “ the carriage 
had just been dragged, for many miles together, 
through stagnant pools.” 

 

Emma. 

Poor Dr. Clarke! I remember greatly pitying 
him, when I read that part of his Travels;— 
not daring to open a window in his carriage on 
the most sultry night he ever felt, for fear of the 
swarms that would force their way in; and not¬ 
withstanding all his precautions, having his ears 
and nostrils filled with them, and his lamp ex¬ 
tinguished the moment it was lighted, by the 
prodigious numbers that heaped themselves in 
a cone over the burner. 

Mr. B. 

Little idea can be formed of the torture which 
these insects occasion to the inhabitants of all 
badly-cultivated lands, from the icy regions of 
the frigid zone to the sultry climates of the 
equator; but travellers give us such accounts of 
it as may well make us thankful for our general 
freedom from them. 

We have now taken a glance at the insect world 
in its relation to other parts of nature and to 
ourselves. In connection with it, I have often 
thought with gratitude of the various means that 
the same merciful Providence, which has appointed 
us these tiny servants in such countless multitudes 



and directed their labours to purposes so beneficial, 
has employed to restrain them within due bounds. 
Prolific as they are, they rarely increase beyond 
the extent in which their services are actually 
required. 

Emma. 

Do not gnats ? 

Mr. B. 

No, not even gnats. They are numerous only 
in proportion to the stagnant waters that they are 
required to purify. 

The disposition, so extensively prevalent among 
insects, to destroy each other, is not the least of 
these means; but besides enemies so abundantly 
found among creatures of their own class, it seems 
as if all nature, animate and inanimate, had it 
in charge to prevent their too great multipli¬ 
cation. 

Among their inanimate enemies, I may mention 
continued rain, which greatly diminishes the 
number of caterpillars, and often leaves us nearly 
free from some species for a series of years. Late 

frosts, which destroy great multitudes in their 



larva state; and inundations, by which many that 
undergo their transformations in the earth are 
drowned. 





Various insect-catching plants also destroy vast 
numbers. Mr. Kirby says that it is scarcely 
possible to find a flower of the muscicapce as - 
clepiadce that has not entrapped its victim; and 
in the United States, these flowers sometimes 
closely cover hundreds of acres together. 

The muscicapce , or fly-catching plants, may 
be divided into three classes : —those that entrap 
insects by the irritability of their stamina, which 
when touched, close upon them ; those that ensnare 
them by some viscous secretion; and those that 
entice them by their carrion-like odour. Some 
of these contain water, in which the unwary tres¬ 
passers are drowned; and others poison the eggs 
which by mistake are intrusted to them. 

But the most formidable enemies to insects are 
found in the various departments of the animal 
kingdom. In each class, from the feeble, half- 
vegetating polype to the beasts of prey that roam 
over the desert, we meet with creatures whose 
chief office seems to be the destruction of insects. 

Among the Mammalia , bats hold in this respect 
a conspicuous place. They fly in the twilight, 
just at the time when many moths leave their 
hiding-places and hover round the flowers, and 




multitudes of these nocturnal invaders fall victims 
to them. They also consume many of the night- 
flying beetles, particularly of the weevils which 
attack, sometimes in a merciless manner, the buds 
and flowers of fruit-trees. 

Frederick. 

I dare say then it is owing to bats that the trees 
in the Castle grounds are so remarkably free from 
insects. The gardener was saying the other day 
he could not account for it. 

Mr. B. 

I have no doubt that it is. Orchards planted 
near barns, churches, or any buildings that afford 
shelter to bats, are much less liable to insects than 
those in more open situations. 

Among the insectivorous Mammalia are also 
various sorts of mice, with moles, badgers, hedge¬ 
hogs, squirrels, pigs and foxes. Some of these 
creatures are, it is true, themselves mischievous to 
the productions of the garden and the farm ; but 
others, and especially the squirrel and the hedge¬ 
hog, deserve our unqualified gratitude. 

Birds contribute still more than mammiferous 
animals to the destruction of insects, particularly 
during the breeding season. I have already 





told you what a number of caterpillars a pair of 
sparrows having young ones to maintain, have 
been computed to destroy in a week. All the 
Passeres , that is, birds of the sparrow kind, which 
constitute at least one half of the whole feathered 
creation, devour insects voraciously. When the 
migratory species begin to take their leave of us 
in the autumn, we are soon made sensible of 
their absence by the much greater annoyance we 
experience from flies and other Diptera on which 
they more especially feed. 

The Scansores or climbers too, such as wood¬ 
peckers, wrynecks, cuckoos, and many others, are 
equally devoted to the destruction of insects ; they 
attack the larvm of many large species that har¬ 
bour in the trunks or among the boughs of trees, 
some of which the smaller birds would be unable 
to destroy. The cuckoo consumes various hairy 
caterpillars which few other birds will touch. 

Mrs. B. 

I believe all birds that feed on grain or fruit, 
feed also more or less, on insects. 

Mr. B. 

Yes: indeed I do not know any to which they 
are wholly unacceptable. Owls devour a great 



many of the night-flying beetles, and locusts are 
pursued not only by that species of thrush called 
the locust-bird, but by vultures, kites, and hawks 
which generally follow in their train, and consume 
great numbers. 

When to these enemies we add fishes, serpents, 
frogs, toads, and various other reptiles, particularly 
lizards, all of which feed largely on insects, we 
shall admire the wise economy that has placed an 
effectual barrier to the too great increase of these 
little creatures by making them, when they have 
fulfilled their allotted tasks, subservient to the 
sustenance of so many animals. 

Frederick. 

Really, with such multitudes of enemies, one 
would imagine the insect races must soon be 
wholly extirpated. 

Mr. B. 

Remember how immensely numerous they are. 
The twenty thousand or perhaps more than twenty 
thousand species to be found described in books 
and arranged in cabinets, probably bear but a 
very small proportion to the whole existing number. 
There are ten thousand species, or more than six 
to each plant, in our own country; adopting this 



average as a standard, it has been calculated that 
as there are fifty thousand known species of 
vegetables in the world, there may be, taking 
the varieties of parasitic insects into account, 
three hundred and fifty thousand or perhaps four 
hundred thousand of insects. And not only are 
the species immensely numerous, but the indivi¬ 
duals composing many of them are multitudinous 
beyond all calculation. Look, for example, at 
locusts, whose armies are so vast that, as it has 
been remarked, all human attempts to diminish 
their numbers would appear like attempting to 
drain the ocean by a pump at the ephemeras 
that emerge at certain seasons of the year from 
the rivers of France, by myriads of millions;— 
at most of the numerous species of lepidopterous 
insects, some of which have been observed to fly- 
in clouds, and to descend like snow storms ;—or at 
the varieties of flies, gnats, midges &c., which fill 
the air in every place and at almost every season, 
with their dancing myriads. 

But our hour is expired, and an engagement 
obliges me now to leave you. 

Emma. 

I hope, Papa, you will find at least one more 



leisure hour before I return to school. I have 
heard nothing yet about either the architects or 
the paper-makers. 

Mr. B. 

I intend, if possible, to introduce them to you 
to-morrow evening.

The last evening J said Emma, as she entered 
the study and cast a disconsolate look at the 
cabinet. I do not mean that I shall be sorry 
to return to school; but I really do very much 
regret that our pleasant evenings are now at 
an end. 

 

Mr. B. 

I regret it too, my love. However, I hope 
that at no very distant period we shall have the 
pleasure of your society permanently; and that 
we shall then have many opportunities of pursuing 
together various branches of natural science, and 
unitedly admiring the minute as well as the vast 
works of God. 

We are this evening to peep at the various 
habitations which some of our insect artisans 
construct. In speaking of insects in their larva 
state, I mentioned a few structures formed during 
that period of their existence. You remember 
the silken tents of the lackey and other cater¬ 
pillars, and the den of the ant-lion. Several other 
fabrics formed during this infant state might have 
been added: the little patchwork coat, for in¬ 
stance, which the grub of the clothes moth 
(Tinea sarcitella) manufactures for itself; and 
the still more remarkable shelters which the 
various species of caddis or case-worms (Pliry - 
gance) form, balanced with such nice regard to 
specific gravity.— 

Frederick. 

They are indeed curious. I have often looked 



at them with wonder when I have picked them 
out of the brook to bait my fishing rod. 

Mr. B. 

Had we time to examine them, they would well 
repay us for our trouble; but we must now 
confine ourselves to perfect insects. 

Among perfect insects, the builders chiefly 
deserving of our attention, with the exception 
of Termites , are bees, wasps, hornets and ants. 
They all belong to the Hymenoptera , and have 
been properly denominated, from their superior 
instincts, principes or chiefs of the insect world. 

Let us look for a few minutes at the varied 
architecture of bees; and first we will pay a visit 
to the hive bees. 

The interior of a bee hive is one of the most 
wonderful things in nature. The most profound 
philosopher, equally with the most incurious 
observer, is struck with astonishment on inspect¬ 
ing it. It is indeed a city in miniature, contain¬ 
ing storehouses, habitations for the citizens, and 
palaces for the sovereign; all constructed of 
materials, and formed on a plan, which the most 
expert artist would endeavour in vain to imitate. 
In all ages, philosophers have devoted their lives 




to an examination of it, and still its construction 
remains a miracle. As our time will not allow 
me to attempt a description of it, I must content 
myself with remarking that the cells of which it 
is composed are built on such exact geometrical 
principles, that if the question had been proposed 
to the most skilful geometrician, how, at the 
smallest expense of space and material, to form 
cells of the greatest capacity and strength, he 
could not have devised a better plan than that 
which bees have adopted. They do not make them 
cylindrical, for that shape would have left number¬ 
less vacuities; nor square or triangular, for then 
a greater quantity of wax would have been re¬ 
quired, and besides that shape would not have 
been adapted to the form of their bodies; but 
hexagonal; by which form, as well as by other 
peculiarities in their structure, they are rendered 
convenient to the inhabitants at the least possible 
expense both of material and of room; and at 
the same time, are much stronger than they could 
have been by any other arrangement. 

Frederick. 

Humble-bees construct honey-combs too; do 
they not ? 





Mr. B. 

Yes: but their structures will scarcely better 
bear comparison with those of the hive-bee than 
the huts of savages will with the houses in Regent’s 
Park. They usually make their nests underground. 

There are several solitary bees that form for 
their young very curious habitations. Some have 
been termed carpenter bees , particularly the apis 
violacea , found in the south of Europe, which 
bores tunnels in a beam, or some other old and 
dry wooden substance, from twelve to fourteen 
inches long, and large enough to admit my finger. 
These tunnels she divides with a kind of mortar 
made of the saw-dust, into ten or twelve com¬ 
partments, lodging in each, before she leaves it, 
an egg, and a quantity of bee-bread. 

Another, the apis muraria , which deserves 
to be called the mason-bee , forms a castle of sand, 
consisting of eight or ten cells, in each of which 
is deposited an egg with its supply of food. 
These castles may be frequently seen on garden 
walls exposed to the sun: to a careless observer 
they appear like lumps of mortar stuck against 
the wall; but if an attempt be made to remove 
them, they will be found to resist the impression 
of the strongest knife. 





A third tribe, appropriately called upholsterers , 
excavate holes in the earth, or sometimes in decayed 
trees; and having lined them with an elegant 
coating of flowers or of leaves, deposit in them 
an egg and the necessary quantity of bee-bread. 
One species, the poppy-bee, lines hers with the 
scarlet petals of the wild poppy. Another, called 
the leaf-cutter-bee, having formed a hole eight 
or ten inches long, fills it with cells formed of 
pieces of rose-leaf, so variously convoluted, and 
the cells fitted one into another with such nice 
precision, that if we did not know who guides 
even the insect to discretion, we should never 
credit their being the work of such an artificer. 
Each cell, when finished, is nearly filled with a 
rose-coloured conserve, composed of honey and 
pollen; an egg is laid in it, and the orifice is 
then closed with three pieces of leaf so exactly 
circular, that a pair of compasses could not define 
their margin with more exactness. 

Reaumur tells an amusing tale in connection 
with these nests. A gardener at Rouen having 
dug up some of them, was exceedingly terrified 
at the appearance of such curious structures. 
Considering them to be undoubtedly produced 





by witchcraft, and to forebode some dreadful 
calamity, he took them to the parish priest, who, 
equally ignorant and superstitious, confirmed his 
apprehensions, and advised him to lose no time 
in proceeding to Paris, and showing them to his 
master. The man, however, who was not de¬ 
ficient in good sense, thought he would first 
take the opinion of Nollet, an eminent naturalist 
in the neighbourhood. Nollet easily explained 
the mysterious appearance; and by pointing out 
the grub, soon dispelled the man’s fears, and spared 
him the expense and trouble of a long journey. 

And now, Emma, for the paper*makers. 

Frederick. 

They are the wasps and hornets. 

Mr. B. 

Yes : races which are to the peaceful industrious 
bees, what lawless banditti lurking in forests are 
to the honest inhabitants of towns and villages. 
They live wholly by rapine; and many a bee, 
as she returns laden with treasure to the hive, 
is waylaid and murdered by these ruthless 
plunderers. 

Mrs. B. 

Blue-bottle flies often share the same fate. 




Mr, B. 

On that account, butchers consider wasps and 
hornets their friends. These fierce marauders 
pounce upon their victim, whether bee or fly, 
and tumbling it to the ground, and separating 
in a trice the soft juicy body from the trunk, 
hurry off with it to their nest, where the delicious 
morsel is soon devoured by themselves and their 
companions. 

But as it is with their buildings rather than 
with their character that we have just now to do, 
I shall not at present dwell longer on their violent 
proceedings, but shall introduce you to their 
habitations, which present them in a far more 
pleasing light. 

“ The wasp, fine architect, surrounds his domes 
With paper foliage, and suspends his combs.” 

I have here a nest of the common species, which 
you may examine for yourself. Its exterior figure, 
you observe, is not unlike a large India-rubber 
bottle, only that the outside surface is neither 
smooth nor uniform in colour. Its want of uni¬ 
formity is owing to the various materials of which 
the paper is made. 

Emma. 

It has two apertures, I perceive \ one, I suppose, 





for ingress, and the other for egress.—How large 
it is! 

Mr. B. 

It is more than a foot in diameter; I will divide 
it in the centre, and show you its internal con¬ 
struction. 

The envelope or outer covering, which is nearly 
an inch in thickness, is not solid, but is formed 
of separate layers of paper with intervals between 
them, so as to render it impervious to moisture. 
The interior contains fifteen or sixteen combs of 
a diameter proportioned to that of the envelope, 
and formed of the same material, all arranged 
in stories. These cells are not like those of bees, 
intended partly for store-houses, but serve merely 
as habitations for themselves and their young. 

Emma. 

Really, the material looks very much like paper; 
where do they get it ? 

Mr. B. 

They make it of the fibres of wood which they 
detach with their powerful jaws from any timber 
that suits their purpose; when they have amassed 
a heap of the filaments, they moisten the whole 
with a few drops of a viscid glue from their 




mouth, and kneading it with their jaws into a 
sort of paste, or papier mache , roll it up into 
a pellet, and fly off with it to the building they 
have in hand. On arriving, they attach it to 
that part at which they were at work, spreading 
it into thin laminae by means of their jaws, tongue, 
and legs. Most vespiaries are formed underground, 
and out of sight, generally at a depth of about 
six inches from the surface; but I once placed 
one which had been dug up in the garden, under 
a glass hive, when the wasps very obligingly 
went on with the process, and gave me an oppor¬ 
tunity of observing it. 

The nest of the hornet, (Vespa Crabro,) the 
fiercest of the Vespa tribe, resembles in its general 
construction that of the common wasp, except 
that it is of a much rougher texture; and is built, 
not in the ground, but either in the holes of old 
walls, or the trunks of decayed trees. 

Mrs. B. 

Curious as are the vespiaries in our own country, 
we have none so elegant and exquisitely fine as 
that of the polistes nidulans , or paper-wasp of 
Cayenne. I once saw one. It was constructed 
of a substance like beautifully-polished white paste- 




board, so solid as to be impervious to the weather. 
In shape it resembled a bell. It was eighteen 
inches long, and had been suspended by its upper 
end to the branch of a tree. The interior was 
fitted up with numerous combs for the convenient 
accommodation of its inhabitants. 

Mr. B. 

We have wasps in our own country that form 
nests nearly of the same shape, only very much 
smaller. Here is one which I once found sus¬ 
pended to the eaves of the summer-house. It is 
scarcely more than an inch in length; and is 
formed, not of polished white card-board, but 
of thin, whitish brown paper. 

Emma. 

How beautiful the large white ones must appear 
suspended among green leaves! 

Frederick. 

Ants too are skilful architects, are they not ? 

Mr. B. 

Many of them erect gigantic edifices, formed of 
various materials, and internally composed of 
numerous apartments of different elevations; but 
as mechanics , ants are not equal in exactness and 
skill to bees and wasps. Some species build with 





earth* blades of grass, chaff, grains of corn, or any 
other substance they may find at hand, availing 
themselves of showers of rain to furnish water,— 
the only cement they possess. Others, the yellow 
ants, for example, frequently establish themselves 
in trees, where they select for building materials 
the finest parcels of rotten wood, mixed with earth 
and the webs of spiders. 

The mention of yellow ants reminds me of one 
peculiarity in their erections which I believe does 
not belong to the elevations of any other species; 
and among them is chiefly confined to those 
that build upon mountains; their hillocks have 
an elongated, regular form, and are constantly 
directed from east to west; so that they serve as 
a sort of compass to the inhabitants of the Alps, 
when they have wandered out of the way during 
the night, or are environed by thick fogs or mists. 
M. Huber says, that he has verified by obser¬ 
vations on thousands of them the facts which 
were communicated to him by the mountaineers. 

In connection with the edifices of ants, we must 
not forget those of the termites. The termites 
belong, as you know, to a different order of 
insects, but are not outdone in architectural skill 
by any of the hymenopterous principes . 





These little creatures, scarcely the fourth of 
an inch in length, erect edifices sometimes twelve 
feet high, and of a proportionable bulk, adorned 
without by numerous pinnacles and turrets, and 
sheltering under an ample dome myriads of vault¬ 
ed apartments of various dimensions, constructed 
of different materials, and designed for different 
purposes:—one in the centre for the mansion of 
the king and queen, who are there immured for 
life; others around for their numerous attendants ; 
some for nurseries; and others for magazines, 
in which stores of food consisting of gums, in¬ 
spissated juices of plants, and particles of wood, 
are laid up. They form, moreover, in different 
directions and at different depths, innumerable 
subterraneous roads ov tunnels, some twelve or 
thirteen inches in diameter, with arches and bridges 
connecting one part with another, not excavated, 
but actually projected with all the skill of an 
engineer. I speak now more particularly of 
the erections of the termes fatalis, a species very 
common on the coast of Africa. When a cluster 
of them, as is often the case, are placed together, 
thev might be taken for an African kraal: thev 
are, in fact, sometimes larger than the huts which 
the natives inhabit. 





The domestic economy of all these insects is 
as remarkable as their talent for architecture. 
Not only bees, but wasps and ants watch over 
their young, keep them in a state of extreme clean¬ 
liness, and feed them with the utmost assiduity. 
Bees supply their grubs with a whitish-coloured 
jelly, prepared on purpose for them, and when 
they cease to eat, carefully cover them up in their 
cells with a waxen lid, and leave them to undergo 
their transformation into pupae. When that is 
accomplished, and the young bees awake to new 
life and issue from the cells in which they had 
reposed, the anxious nurses flock around them, 
lick them clean, supply them with food, and 
having thus finished their preparation for labour, 
and seen them sally forth on their first day’s toil, 
begin to clean out the cradles in which they have 
lain, and to fit them for the reception of a fresh 
set of tenants. 

Wasps and ants feed their larvae from the 
mouth, nearly in the same manner as birds feed 
their young, giving them, from time to time, a 
small quantity of aliment which has been prepared 
and rendered sufficiently digestible in their own 
stomachs. 





But the history of the principes is so full of 
wonders that I scarcely know what to select. 
M. Huber seems to have thought them, and 
especially ants, endowed with all but human in¬ 
tellect. He gives us such a lively account of 
the slave-dealers among these little creatures, of 
their flocks and herds, of their gymnastics and 
wars, and of their actions of kindness towards 
their friends, that we are tempted to ask, can 
this be true of creatures so diminutive and ap¬ 
parently so insignificant? The facts he states 
have, however, been so repeatedly verified by 
subsequent and close observers, that, however 
much we may wonder, no room is left for us 
to disbelieve or doubt. 

Frederick. 

What are the slave-dealers, Father? 

Mr. B. 

The Amazon, or legionary ants, (formica 
rufescens;) they are not found in our country, 
but were observed by M. Huber in the neighbour¬ 
hood of Geneva, where they are not uncommon. 
These ants are both warlike and powerful, but 
unlike the rest of the tribe, far from industrious. 
To relieve themselves therefore from the necessity 





of labour, they attack the dwellings of the ash- 
coloured ants, or negroes , as they may be called, 
and carrying off the larvae and pupae of this in¬ 
dustrious, peaceable, and stingless race, devolve 
upon them the whole care of procuring provisions, 
of nursing and educating their young, and of 
building and defending their habitations. It 
is pleasing to add that these poor little slaves, 
though u forced from home/’ transported to 
a foreign soil, and obliged to labour for strangers, 
experience no oppression, but are treated by their 
kidnappers with such kindness that soon all seem 
to form but one family, and to have but one 
interest. 

After what I have already said of the fondness 
of ants for aphides, you will perhaps guess in 
what their flocks and herds consist. It is a 
well-attested fact, that some species carry their 
taste for these little melliferous insects so far as to 
be at the trouble of transporting them into the 
interior of their habitations, where they watch 
over them with as much care as we employ 
towards our cows and sheep. The yellow ants, 
to which I recommend you to apply for lemonade, 
are remarkable for the instinct they display in 





this particular. These ants are different in their 
habits from most others ; they scarcely ever issue 
from their subterraneous abodes, and are not 
to be met with on the leaves or fruits of trees. 
How then can they subsist? As M. Huber 
pleasantly remarks, “ they are a pastoral people, 
and derive their subsistence chiefly from their 
flocks and herds of aphides; these,” he adds, 
“ are their cattle, cows, or goats; and an ant-hill 
may be considered more or less rich according 
to the number of aphides which it possesses.” 

The preservation of aphides is an object of so 
much interest to these ants, that even their eggs 
receive from them the greatest attention. They 
lick them continually, invest them with a gluten 
which cements them together, and in a word, 
perform for them all that is necessary for their 
preservation and fecundity. Ants are excellent 
herdsmen. 

There are four or five species that thus possess 
aphides; but in a smaller number, and less 
constantly, than the yellow ants. Those that 
climb trees loaded with these insects, and there 
enjoy their sweets, are less careful to cultivate 
them at home. 





Emma. 

Really, Papa, ants are wonderful little creatures. 

Mr. B. 

You would indeed think so, did time allow 
to tell all that is to be told respecting them. 

Frederick. 

I cannot think that ants are more wonderful in 
their instincts and habits than bees:—look at the 
order they observe in swarming; at their attach¬ 
ment to their queen; at the ventilation of their 
hives, and the various means they employ to 
defend them; at the economy with which they 
lay up whatever of honey and bee-bread they 
collect, more than they require for immediate 
use: and especially at the unaccountable fact, 
that however far they may be from home, when 
they return, they fly in a direct line to their nest 
without ever missing the way. 

Mr. B. 

I am not disposed to give to ants the precedence 
of bees, I assure you. Another remarkable display 
of the intellect of bees is exhibited in collecting 
the farina of which they make their bread . On 
whatever flower the bee first alights to gather 
it, she continues gathering from that kind of 





flower alone during the whole excursion, even 
though it may be much scarcer than many others. 
If she begin with a violet, for example, she will 
continue to collect from violets only, till having 
filled with pellets of the ambrosial fare the little 
baskets with which her legs are furnished, she 
returns laden with them to the hive. 

Emma. 

I do not yet quite understand the difference 
between bee-bread and honey. 

Mr. B. 

Honey is a sweet fluid which the bee sucks 
up with her tongue from the nectarium of flowers, 
and also from the sweet juices of fruits. Having 
stored it in the first stomach, or honey-bag, on 
returning home, she either pours it into one 
of the cells prepared for it, or gives it to such 
of her companions as have been at work within. 
From the nectar that furnishes honey is elabo¬ 
rated also the wax of which the cells are formed. 

Bee-bread is made of the pollen of flowers. 
When the bee has filled her honey-bag, she next, 
before returning home, collects, as I have describ¬ 
ed, the farina for bread , the chief food both of 
old and young. On arriving at the hive, having 





eaten herself, and given to her friends engag¬ 
ed in domestic toils, as much of it as they 
require, she carefully stores up what remains 
in some of the empty cells for future use. In 
some combs, a large proportion of the cells are 
filled with this bread; an adequate supply of 
it being indispensable for bees during the winter 
season. If robbed of their honey, treacle will 
do in its place; but no substitute has yet been 
found for this more solid and equally important 
viand. When deprived of it, they become con¬ 
sumptive and die. 

Besides honey and pollen, bees collect another 
substance called propolis . This is a resinous 
gum, gathered from poplars and other trees, 
and is employed to line and strengthen the angles 
of the cells, and to stop up every crevice by 
which cold, wet, or any enemy might enter. 

Frederick. 

Is it not with this substance mixed with wax 
that bees sometimes barricade their hives to 
prevent the entrance of the death’s-head moth ? 

Mr. B. 

Yes: and with it they embalm any intruder 
that they cannot otherwise get rid of. If a slug 





or snail, for instance, have the audacity to enter 
and walk over the comb, they first quickly sting 
him to death, and then, having no means of 
removing so large a bodv, and fearing the noxious 
effluvia arising from corruption, cover it over with 
propolis. 

Emma. 

What astonishing instinct! 

Mr. B. 

This is not the only proof they give of instinct 
in defending their hives; on the principle that 
prevention is better than cure, they place sentinels 
at the entrance to ward off moths and other 
creatures, that might otherwise intrude during 
the night. On a fine moonlight evening, you 
may often see the bees on guard, parading back¬ 
wards and forwards before the opening of the 
hive; if they happen to detect an invader, he 
falls an immediate victim to them just vengeance. 

Not unfrequently they have to defend them¬ 
selves also against their own species. It is no 
uncommon thing in an unfavorable season, when 
flowers are scarce and provisions consequently 
difficult to be obtained, for some bees to get into 
bad habits and endeavour to rob their neighbours. 





A robber-bee may at once be known by his 
shining, darker colour, caused by having lost his 
hair in combats ; and also by his sneaking manner 
of approach ; he does not fly boldly into the hive, 
but generally tries to enter at some unfrequented 
crevice at the back. If robber-bees effect their 
entrance, fierce battles ensue, in which assailants 
and defendants poignard each other with their 
stings in a merciless manner, and many are 
slain. Sometimes the robber-bees prevail, and 
get possession of the coveted stores 5 but if the 
attacked hive have a good, courageous queen, 
they usually fight bravely and defeat the invaders. 

Frederick. 

Bees have no weapon besides their sting, have 
they ? 

Mr. B. 

No: but that is a fearful instrument of 
slaughter: a bee cannot be killed so suddenly, 
except by crushing, as by the sting of another bee. 
Watching an opportunity, the enemy darts its 
sharp point between the scales of the body, and 
the next instant, the defeated bee stretches out its 
quivering wings and expires. 




Mrs, B. 

Ants, I believe, defend themselves chiefly by 
their acid, 

Mr. B. 

Those especially that have no sting. Having 
bitten their victim, they insinuate into the wound 
a small quantity of this secretion which dispatches 
it instantly. In this manner they often kill 
large insects which they are unable to capture 
alive. The" acid effluvia proceeding from the 
myriads in an ant-hill are said to be sufficiently 
powerful to kill a frog. 

Many insects, besides ants, employ noxious 
secretions as a means of defence. One species 
of carabus, occasionally found here, ( Brachini,) 
the Bombardiers , as they are called, employ 
that with which they are furnished in an amusing 
manner. When a Brachinus crepitans is pur¬ 
sued by its great enemy, Calosoma inquisitor , 
it seems at first to have no means of escape, and 
you fancy it is about to submit to its persecutor : 
suddenly, however, a loud explosion is heard, and 
a blue smoke attended by a very disagreeable scent 
is seen to issue from the insect, and effectually 
to stop the progress of the assailant. The bom¬ 
bardier can fire his artillery twenty times in 




succession, if necessary, and by this means gain 
time to effect his escape. 

If we had leisure to enter more at large on the 
modes of defence employed by insects, I could 
name others that would perhaps equally amuse 
you. Several defend themselves from those ene¬ 
mies that will feed only on living prey, by simu¬ 
lating death: many a dung-chafer thus avoids 
the hungry bill of the rook. Others secure 
themselves by assumiug various disguises: some 
caterpillars fix themselves by their hind-legs to 
a branch in such a position that they look exactly 
like a little twig of it, and thus elude the pursuit 
of birds; wood-lice roll themselves up into a 
ball; one species, when thus rolled up, so exact¬ 
ly resemble beads, that Swammerdam’s maid¬ 
servant, finding a number of them in a corner 
of her master’s garden, actually set about string¬ 
ing them for a necklace: but they did not 
carry on the deception quite long enough; and 
beginning to move and to struggle for liberty, 
the poor girl quickly threw down her prize, and 
ran away screaming in the utmost terror. 

Noises are another means of defence to which 
insects have occasional recourse. The death’s head 
moth ; when menaced by the stings of myriads of 





enraged bees, whose property she is plundering, 
knows how effectually to disarm them of their 
fuiy by uttering her shrill, plaintive note. Many 
beetles, as the dung-chafer, carrion-chafer, bury¬ 
ing beetle and others, when taken, show their 
alarm by a shrill sibilapt or creaking sound, 
produced by rubbing the ends of their elytrae 
with the extremity of the abdomen; and bees, 
wasps, and hornets, as is well known, emit various 
tones, as they are influenced by the emotions 
of fear, of anger, or of gladness. 

The number of insects that have the power 
of producing sound is however small: very 
many in every order are perfectly silent. None 
of the Neuroptera are vocal; nor of the Lepi- 
doptera , with the exception of the death's-head 
moth. 

Frederick. 

You mentioned some of the Hemiptera as 
musical. 

Mr. B. 

The most vociferous insects belong to that order. 
Some of the Orthoptera are however sufficiently 
noisy. With the vocalists of both, love is the 
soul of song; animated by its inspiring principle, 
the males of some species of the grasshopper 




and cicada tribes have even rivalled the perform¬ 
ances of man. 

Emma. 

Are not the females musicians too ? 

Mr. B. 

No: they are too diligent so to amuse them¬ 
selves. The saucy Xenarchus says,—¦ 

“ Happy the cicada’s lives, 

Since they all have voiceless wives.” 

The notes of insects and their instruments for 
producing them, from the gentle tap of the con¬ 
cealed little death-watch, whose sound is full of 
alarm to the superstitious, to the loud chorus 
of the melodious harpers, whose tune charmed 
even Athenian ears, are very various. 

The death-watch (Anobium tesselatum,) so 
called because the sound it emits resembles the 
ticking of a watch, produces its terror-inspiring 
call by raising itself upon its hind-legs, and beating 
its head with great agility and force against the 
plane of position. The sound is exactly like 
that produced by the tapping with the finger¬ 
nail upon the table; and when familiarized, the 
insect will answer very readily to the tap of 
the nail, supposing it to be a response from his 
companions. 




Frederick. 

I think I can guess what insects you mean by 
the u melodious harpersfor I recollect to have 
read that a cicada sitting upon a harp was the 
usual emblem of the science of music among 
the Greeks. 

Mr. B. 

You recollect then the story of the two rival 
musicians, Eunomus and Ariston, who were 
engaged in a contest of skill, when a cicada or 
tettix , settling upon the harp of the former, supplied 
the place of a broken string, and secured to him 
the victory. To excel this insect seems to have 
been the highest commendation of a singer ; 
and even the eloquence of Plato was not thought 
to suffer by a comparison with it. The instrument 
of the cicada for producing sound is a species 
of drum, of very complicated structure. 

Emma. 

I suppose we have none of these musical insects. 

Mr. B. 

No: they are inhabitants of much warmer 
latitudes. With the Athenians they were such 
favourites, that they were kept in cages for the 
sake of their song, and golden images of them 
were worn as ornaments. 




Mrs. B. 

The ladies in Spain keep grasshoppers in cages 
at the present day for the pleasure of hearing 
their chirp. 

Mr. B. 

Many persons in different countries have evinced 
a similar taste. The learned Scaliger so admired 
the note of the house-cricket, that he always kept 
some in a box in his study. 

Emma. 

Is these any difference between the note of 
the cricket and the grasshopper ? 

Mr. B. 

The song of the grasshopper is a short chirp, 
regularly interrupted; that of the cricket is long 
and continued. You may frequently hear both 
the field-cricket and the grasshopper in rural 
districts, where their cheerful notes lend additional 
charms to the glowing beauties of a summer’s day. 

There are insects of another kind that add charms 
to the brilliancy of summer, which I must not 
omit to introduce to you. I refer to such as are 
luminous. A small species of millepede (Scolo - 
jienda electrica,) when the sun has shone on 
it during the day, may often be seen shining 
in the evening upon our garden-paths with a 


pale softened light; but our most brilliant insects 
are glow-worms, the females of a species of beetle, 
(Lampyris.) 

Emma. 

The three Frederick put into a glass phial and 
brought home in the carriage the other evening-, 
gave sufficient light to enable me to see the hour 
by my watch. 

Mr. B. 

Our glow-worms are but cottage rush-lights 
compared with the lamps that glitter in tropical 
countries. The light emitted by the fire-fly 
(Lcimpyris noctilucus*) of the West Indies, is so 
brilliant that the smallest print may be read 
by moving one of them along the lines. In St. 
Domingo, we are told, the natives used to employ 
these living lamps, which they called cucuij , in the 
place of candles ; and when they travelled, secured 
sufficient light by tving one to each great toe. 

Southey has beautifully described the first effect 
of their brilliancy on the British visitors of the 
New World:— 

---- u Sorrowing: we behold 

The night come on; but soon did night display 
More wonders than it veil’d; innumerous tribes 
From the wood cover swarm’d, and darkness made 



Their beauties visible : one while they stream’d 
A bright blue radiance upon flowers that close 
Their gorgeous colours from the eye of day; 

Now motionless and dark, eluded search, 
Self-shrouded ; and anon, starring the sky, 

Rose like a shower of fire.” 

The lantern-flies of South America and China 
are hemipterous insects. Their light does not 
proceed, as in fire-flies and glow-worms, from 
luminous tubercles on the thorax and abdomen, 
but from a hollow transparent projection of the 
head. Hence their name of lantern-flies . Some 
species of them, particularly fulgora laternaria* 
excel even fire-flies in brilliancy. Travellers 
describe the trees on the banks of the Meinam, 
which are studded with multitudes of these living 
brilliants, some at rest and others in motion, 
as presenting at night a superlatively splendid 
appearance. One of them is sufficiently bright 
to read a newspaper by. 

Emma. 

Of what use is this light to the insect ? 

Mr. B. 

That is scarcely more satisfactorily ascertained 
than its nature. In some it may be a means of 
defence to distract or alarm their enemies; in 





others, it may serve to guide them either to their 
mates or in the pursuit of prey. It is remarkable 
that most of them appear to possess the power of 
kindling or extinguishing it at pleasure. 

The ignes fatui, commonly called Jack o’lan- 
terns, that used in former days so to alarm 
country people, are now known to be, in many 
cases at least, nothing more than luminous insects. 
One of them, once encountered by some valiant 
yeomen in Cambridgeshire, proved to be a mole 
cricket. 

Emma. 

Why were country people so terrified ? 

Mr. B. 

Various superstitions have been entertained 
respecting these lights. Some have believed them 
to be souls come all on fire out of purgatory, to 
move the pitying spectators to say masses for 
their deliverance ; others, evil spirits seeking from 
mere love of mischief, to mis-lead benighted 
travellers. He comes 

“ On purpose to deceive us, 

And leading us makes us to stray 
Long winter nights out of the way, 

And when we stick in mire or clay, 

He doth with laughter leave us.” 





A traveller in England in the sixteenth century, 
records, that on the road from Canterbury to 
Dover, so many jack o’lanterns appeared that he 
and his party were greatly amazed and frightened. 

Mrs. B. 

Among the numerous advantages of science, 
not the least are the means it affords of explaining 
many appearances that were formerly regarded 
with alarm. How different the feelings of those 
who look at these vagrant lights as the mazy 
dance of sportive insects, and hear the little beetle’s 
tick as the voice of love and friendship to its kind, 
from theirs who regard the one as evil spirits 
on mischief bent, and listen to the other as the 
death knell of some endeared relative! 

Mr. B. 

The mind that is intelligently relieved from 
superstitious apprehensions, is freed from much 
needless suffering. 

It would be waste of time to tell how, not only 
death-watches and jack o’lanterns, but death’s-head 
moths, crickets, lady-birds and bees, with many 
others of these little harmless beings, have been 
supposed to influence the destinies of man, and have 
been courted or avoided as superstition dictated. 
One more terrific prodigy connected with our 





subject I cannot forbear to name:—You have heard 
of showers of blood as among the fearful portents 
of many gloomy periods. 

Frederick. 

I remember Ovid commemorates an occurrence 
of the kind among the prodigies which took place 
after the death of the great dictator:— 

u With threatening signs the lowering skies were fill’d, 
And sanguine drops from murky clouds distill’d.” 

Mr. B. 

In Stowe’s Chronicle we have two accounts 
of showers of blood in our own country; one 
of them “ occurred in the time of Brithricus, king 
of the West Saxons, (about 790 A. D.,) when 
it rained blood, which falling on men’s clothes, 
appeared like crosses.” In the reign of Octa¬ 
vius, we are told, blood fell in Egypt, and 
in that of Nero, in Italy, tinging the rivers 
with a red colour. Two similar nstances of 
showers of blood are recorded in the tenth century; 
one in the eleventh; two in the twelfth; one 
in the thirteenth; two in the fourteenth; one in 
the fifteenth; and five in the sixteenth. About 
the end of that century, it began to be suspected 
by men of science, that these phenomena were 
attributable to insect sources; and subsequent 





observations have confirmed the suspicion, and 
dispelled the gloom hitherto attendant on these 
appearances, by proving that the sanguineous 
showers, at sight of which the stoutest hearts 
had quailed, are really nothing more than drops 
of a red liquid which some papilionaceous insects, 
and especially the peacock, nettle, and atalanta 
butterflies, emit on quitting the puparium. 

This is but one of numerous instances in which 
an appearance deemed supernatural, and of which 
priestcraft had availed itself to impose on the 
ignorant, has been stripped by science of its 
terrors, and assigned to its right place among the 
great and curious works of a beneficient Creator. 

I regret to find that the hour which I had 
allotted this evening to our interesting subject 
is more than expended, and that we cannot for the 
present pursue it further. I believe, however, 
that the end proposed by our entomological 
discussions has been answered, and that my dear 
Emma will in future look with as much pleasure 
at insects, as at the plants and flowers which they 
inhabit and adorn.
