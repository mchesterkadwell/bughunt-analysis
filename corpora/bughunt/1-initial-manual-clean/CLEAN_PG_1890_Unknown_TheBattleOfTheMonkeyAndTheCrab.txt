a monkey and a crab once met when going round a mountain the monkey had picked up a persimmonseed and the crab had a piece of toasted ricecake the monkey seeing this and wishing to get something that could be turned to good account at once said pray exchange that ricecake for this persimmonseed the crab without a word gave up his cake and took the persimmonseed and planted it at once it sprung up and soon became a tree so high one had to look up at it the tree was full of persimmons but the crab had no means of climbing the tree so he asked the monkey to climb up and get the persimmons for him the monkey got up on a limb of the tree and began to eat the persimmons the unripe persimmons he threw at the crab but all the ripe and good ones he put in his pouch the crab under the tree thus got his shell badly bruised and only by good luck escaped into his hole where he lay distressed with pain and not able to get up now when the relatives and household of the crab heard how matters stood they were surprised and angry and declared war and attacked the monkey who leading forth a numerous following bid defiance to the other party the crabs finding themselves unable to meet and cope with this force became still more exasperated and enraged and retreated into their hole and held a council of war then came a ricemortar a pounder a bee and an egg and together they devised a deeplaid plot to be avenged first they requested that peace be made with the crabs and thus they induced the king of the monkeys to enter their hole unattended and seated him on the hearth the monkey not suspecting any plot took the hibashi or poker to stir up the slumbering fire when bang went the egg which was lying hidden in the ashes and burned the monkeys arm surprised and alarmed he plunged his arm into the pickletub in the kitchen to relieve the pain of the burn then the bee which was hidden near the tub stung him sharply in his face already wet with tears without waiting to brush off the bee and howling bitterly he rushed for the back door but just then some seaweed entangled his legs and made him slip then down came the pounder tumbling on him from a shelf and the mortar too came rolling down on him from the roof of the porch and broke his back and so weakened him that he was unable to rise up then out came the crabs in a crowd and brandishing on high their pinchers they pinched the monkey to pieces
